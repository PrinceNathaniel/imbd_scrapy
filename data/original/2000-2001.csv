10,"Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in India but i've watched the rest on DVD or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who play Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, DAR meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend Lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.",2007
3,"When I first watch this series, the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny, Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative. After watching it for some time, however, my opinion changed.",2008
7,"The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.",2003
4,"Looking for something new to watch, I perused the ratings of various television shows and noticed that the ""Gilmore Girls"" had an astonishingly high 8.6 rating and was intrigued. I came to the show with absolutely no preconceptions The title indicated it might be a ""chick show"", though was not discouraged as I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and appreciate shows featuring strong female characters. So, I managed to find a copy of the first season, and set about watching it. From there, it was all downhill.",2007
1,"I tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program ""Gilmore Girls"". It baffled me for I just couldn't put my finger on what this was about. Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally, I just didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. The writing is neither ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" it's syrupy and tedious.",2007
1,"First off, I've seen very few episodes. It's not that it is visually boring, but more the fact that the pointless back-and-forth banter and frequent ""witty"" sparring makes me want to pierce my own eardrums with an icepick. Unfortunately since giving up on the series, my roommate continues and the one thing I cannot escape is that same mind-numbing drone of characters spewing quick one-liners at each other.",2015
1,"This is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show. People say its witty and intelligence? I don't see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Maybe because they are snooty, use dry humor, and have 2 dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters. In fact had I met someone like them I would have likely strangled them! The men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes... The characters are no AT ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis.",2007
1,"Usually when I don't see a show on an original run, I find it later on cable and realize it's a gem. The ""Gimore Girls"" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it.",2008
1,"I decided to watch this show and give it a go but I found it to be boring, and more importantly dull.....Dull.",2008
9,"Remember the good old days of The WB airing classics like Dawson's Creek, Felicity and Everwood? Shows that had heart, warmth and realism were all the rage in the late 90s and early into the noughties. They made us feel for the characters and the story lines were smart, witty and heartfelt each time.",2010
10,"This is a great show about a small town of wonderful eccentric people, but centering around a single mother, her daughter, and the diner owner who has been there to ""protect and help"" them as if they were his own family since they hit town 18 years earlier. And soooo much more warm, honest stuff. Everyone should watch it. I have it on disk - every episode of it - and watch a ""marathon run"" of all the episodes once every few years. It just keeps getting better and better. Always puts the world in perspective for me, reminding me of what is truly important in life - or should be - for all of us.",2011
8,"Battle Royale is based on the shockwave novel by Koushun Takami, which is a bestseller in Japan, and which has become very controversial in a very short time (and it is really easy to understand why). The plot is relatively simple (a class of junior high school students are forced to kill each other on a desert island, the last survivor wins and can go back home), but it is this simplicity that makes its strength. No need for a very long prologue before we enter the main act. Each of the 42 pupils involved in this ""game"" are not volunteers (no one would be..,), and of course they are forced to kill their best friends /girlfriends in order to survive this horror. The personalities and characteristics of each of the participants are of course very contrasted and even if there are some cliches, well, the worst has been avoided. There are even quite ""realistic"" (even if it is very difficult to judge what can be realistic with such a plot) moments. The transcription of the inner thoughts of the characters, which is one of the strengths of the book, is averagely well retranscripted. Takeshi Kitano plays a ""teacher"" (whose name is ...Kitano), leading the operation of surveilliance of this ""game"". It is very difficult to give an objective comment on this movie. Violent. Ultra-Violent. And bloody. This is for sure. The book has to be read for a more complete description of the hesitations and fears, but the movie restranscripts very well the book is the sense that it is all ""absurd"". There is no real meaning to this violence. The students know this, but it can not be avoided.  It is quite sad that the movie dropped an essential background element of the book (the story in the book takes place in an imaginery Japan which would have not lost WWII, and the movie takes place in a slightly modified modern Japan), but I guess that making this happen in the ""real-world"" shows that there is no need to go to an imaginary world to see to what extreme behaviors humans are capable of.",2000
9,"This film is film that I believed had to be made, and it was only a matter of time before it was.  Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could never have conceived making.",2001
9,"There have been contrasting cries of ""greatest film ever made"" and ""pointless gore fest"" made about BR, and neither are accurate in my opinion. What it is, is a commentary about ""perceived"" (real or otherwise) problems among Japanese teens in the late 90's.",2008
10,"Kinji Fukasaku made a film called Battle Royale back in 2000. He's made plenty of films in the past. I've seen very few of them, apart from Battle Royale but I'm always searching for more.",2003
10,"The Place: Japan. The Time: The not-so-distant-future. Faced with the prospect of losing control over the nation's young people, a totalitarian government decides upon a ruthless demonstration of power. The Battle Royale Act annually sends a randomly-selected class of high school students to an uninhabited island where they are compelled to kill each other until only one of their number survives.",2006
10,"I couldn't believe my eyes. Out of all of the horror/survival films I have ever seen, this is definitely on top of the list. I don't just mean that in terms of foreign films, I mean in terms of film. I was immersed into this crazy scenario that may seem absolutely ridiculous at first, but once you look at it, it almost turns into a not so outlandish thought.",2005
8,"Based on a Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, ""Battle Royale"" is the story of a group of ninth graders who are transported to a small isolated island with a map, food and different arms. They are told to fight each other for three consecutive days until there remains but one student, who will then be named the 'winner'. All students are forced to wear a metal collar with a radar so that their teacher is aware when a rule is being broken.",2006
10,"""Battle Royale"" is one of the most controversial and challenging movies ever made.The film is very gory and violent,but it's also witty,satirical and thought provoking.The concept of ""Battle Royale"" is pretty simple.The act of Battle Royale decrees that once a year a class of 9th graders is chosen at random,stranded on a small island,and armed with random weapons.The kids are also outfitted with strange necklaces that monitor their locations and life functions,and explode if more than one student is alive at the end of 72 hours.The kids are forced to become savage killers,and the movie provides them with interesting personalities and human reactions to the horrible situation in which they find themselves.The acting is brilliant and the violence is horrific and merciless.The film is very exciting and well-photographed.A masterpiece that needs to be seen by every fan of wonderful Japanese cinema!",2004
3,"Having just seen the movie Battle Royale, I have come up with a few rules for survival that 9th grade Japanese students might find useful: ",2005
8,"Is the question put before 42 Japanese school children, minutes after waking up from being put to sleep and minutes before they will fight in a bloody battle to the death. Seconds after the children learn their probable fate, they are greeted with a video. An upbeat video, the sort of video you would expect at a McDonalds induction day, but this video explains the rules of the 'game'. ",2003
9,"40 Ninth grade students and two transfer students have 3 days on a island to wipe each other out, only one can survive and if not they shall all die.",2005
6,"Gods, 7.8 rating score for this movie?",2002
1,What is the point!!?? The premise of this movie is that in a not so far away future Japan will have a serious unemployment issue and 800.000 students feeling that there is no future for them start to boycott school and authorities are afraid of rebellion.,2007
1,"Easily the worst film I've seen this year, possibly the worst film of all time. A Japanese twist on American reality shows, only with lots of blood. It has a high school mentality that just drags the film down to a juvenile level. One dying teenager says to another, ""you look cool"", the other dying teenager replies, ""you are the coolest girl in the world."" And so it continues...teens admitting hidden crushes and unrequited loves, then dying violently. I found myself laughing hysterically at times that were probably intended to be profound and moving. I thought maybe the director was being satirical and the whole thing was a spoof...but I think not. The ending with Kitano was ridiculous. Finally, the multiple ""requiems"" at the end was just melodrama at its absolute worst. I'm sure easily manipulated teens will be crying, but savvy viewers will be laughing at the ludicrousness of it all.",2007
4,"This movie is a 15 year-old's dream. For those of us who are fully clear of puberty, its a strange film. The violence is graphic, but ridiculous. The characters are paper thin. The only good thing is at least I can keep the cliched characters straight. I was amused by the nerd, and cheered for the wicked trashy girl. And it was fun seeing Go-Go from Kill Bill, even if she died pretty early on. I really hated the two random students who were added - Mr. evil crazy hair and Mr. goody goody. Basically they did all the killing, they looked about 25 years old. The stat lines at the bottom are absolutely hilarious. The Teacher was just ridiculous. Not to mention that the government was paying 20some soldiers for 3 days just to kill a few middle schoolers. I don't feel like I wasted my time seeing this. But I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. Japanese movies are weird...",2004
1,this movie is full of bad acting and nonsense. please do not watch this movie or you'll be as mad as me to waste your time. and now i have to write 10 lines of stupidness to submit this review. because with less lines it won't be submitted.,2014
4,"Having nearly exhausted the catalog of ""good"" horror movies, I've turned to explore more ""shock"" cinema, of which Japan is currently forefront, mostly because of Takashi Miike's twisted brilliance. I've heard much about Battle Royale since its release in 2000, particularly in regard towards its shocking premise and excessive gore. I was excited to see this movie, but was sorely disappointed with the actual experience.",2006
3,"if ""lord of the flies"" sucked, it would be this movie... i quite liked the premise of ""battle royale"", sort of an update and extension of the ideas in william golding's novel, melded with orwell's ""1984"", or stephen king's ""the long walk/the running man""... it falls short of those tales in many ways...",2006
2,"Easily the most jaw-droppingly awful movie I've seen in ages. I wish so badly that this was released in theaters over here so it could get pummeled by the critics. Akin to most Asian ""schockers"" and horror, its all premise and absolutely nothing else. The first ten minutes is kind of cool and does a decent job (or rather not) of setting up what unfortunately turns into the most baffling mess of a movie I've possibly ever seen.",2005
2,"I am amazed by all the praising reviews I have read since I watched this movie. I respect all opinions, but all got for my money were two hours of cheesy, violent entertainment.",2002
9,"*SPOILER ALERT* Japanese society is escalating out of control. The youth is boycotting school, even physically abusing the staff. The government, from an act of sheer desperation, passes the Battle Royale Act - where a select class of students is moved to a desert island, given weapons and certain survival necessities, and ordered to kill each other before three days are up or be killed.",2006
10,I saw Chocolat again last night. I had forgotten how lovely a movie it is! People need stories like this these days.,2004
8,"I had heard all the rave reviews, saw the number of Oscar nominations this flick received but still wasn't convinced it was a movie I'd like.  I want to kick myself now for waiting this long to see it!  Yes, I forsook the big screen for the video but I wasn't disappointed a bit.",2001
10,"A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, `Chocolat,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid 50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test. 	As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. 	What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit. Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the `sweetest' film of the year, as well as one of the best, `Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.  I rate this one 10/10.",2001
8,"Beautiful movie from master-director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) with wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and Hallström's wife Lena Olin. ""Chocolat"" is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a ""chocolaterie"" in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale: the characters, the story, the music, the whole idea of an old conservative French village ",2005
10,"I have only seen this movie for the first time today. I have to admit that I hesitated somewhat as I did not believe I would like it because it was described to me as a 'chick flick', a genre I do not subscribe to even though I am a girl. How wrong was that description. I loved the film, the story, the scenery. Such genuine & diverse characters. The actors chosen were perfect for their roles, I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts. The DVD I had was borrowed, but I intend to buy a copy for myself as it would fit into my small library of movies. I have to see it again & this time I will share the experience with my partner as I know he will appreciate the story. Lida",2005
10,-This film transports through the art of story telling.,2010
10,"What a pure delight Chocolat is. Gentle, Beautiful and heart warming. That could describe many films but unlike others it displays no clichés or tired ideas. It is refreshing and pure. The cast is superb, Binoche is a wonder who glides effortlessly through the part of the mysterious and beautiful Vianne. Molina is excellent as the repressed yet lustful Comte Renauld. Depp is as eccentric and wonderful as always.In fact the whole cast is fantastic. The story has all the elements of a wonderful fairy tale yet the perfect direction and the delightfully authentic french setting makes it serious movie. You really care about the characters and the many inter-twinned story lines keep you watching with joy.It also has a wonderful score and excellent costumes and sets, in fact in writing this review I cannot think of any criticism I could make. It is that rare thing : a truly perfect movie.",2007
9,"The movie Chocolat is a magical tale of a small village with many rules on how villagers are to live and act and behave. Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop, she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time, Vianne, the owner of the chocolaterie, struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on, does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others. The major characters include the mayor (Alfred Molina) of the village who is always trying to do what is right even though his own private world is that of despair. The conflict between him and Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is very evident. Then the character Roux (Johnny Depp) is considered a ""river rat"" by the villagers but ends up as Vianne's own personal piece of chocolate that opens her eyes to happiness. Josephine (Lena Olin) is another woman in the village whose husband, Serge (Peter Stormare), is very abusive and when given the opportunity to leave and begin working with Vianne, she jumps on it. Armande (Judi Dench) is the landlord of Chocolatery and is faced with a broken relationship with her daughter. Armande does what she wants and says what she wants and her witty comments immediately draw you in. This movie is much more than romance, it's magic through the guilty pleasures of chocolate. The actors and actresses make you feel like you are right there wanting to experience life as they wish to. The costumes and setting throughout the movie is beautiful and make a remarkable contribution to the movie. The setting is important to this movie because it helps you become drawn in like you are truly there in this small village. The village buildings are beautiful as well as many other locations throughout the movie. The costumes are important as everyone wears very dull colors while Vianne (the outsider) wears red heals and bright colors. The movie is a must see and is very entertaining. The way the chocolate scene's become magical makes you want to be right there with her and become a part of it.",2010
10,"I was not sure if I was gonna like this movie or not but I end up liking it very much from the first five minutes till the end,I smiled all along watching it and in the middle of it I felt the urge of stopping it and went to eat some chocolate!I was literally craving chocolate!I do not agree with the reviews that say it was predictable,it was not a bit predictable for me and I really loved the ending.After such a great story it was really nice to see that all's well that ends well. Julliet Binoch is really gorgeous and is perfect for the part,all along the movie you feel like she is hiding something from the mystery of her eyes and the way she smiles. Johney Depp's performance and also all the other cast are good too. It's really worth watching,it's just that you are gonna end up craving chocolate just as I did!",2010
10,"Having seen the movie and then read the book i'll admit i was a little shocked at how many changes were made but i suppose it would have been quite difficult to stay true to the story and so some of the changes were acceptable. but i think that two of the changes should not have been made. Firstly i was rather confused by the way they changed the setting of the film from the early 1990s to 1959 a rather pointless change i thought. And secondly in the film Viannes mother is portrayed as a tribal wanderer type of person supposedly spreading chocolate around France whereas in the book she is a rather more complex superstitious character who is more interested in Tarot cards than chocolate and it is Vianne who is interested in chocolate. But there you go. Obviously the film was intended to be a little more happy and ""do gooder"" than the rather dark book. Nevertheless i thoroughly enjoyed the film and it remains one of my favourites.",2007
10,"I actually was rooting for ""Chocolat"" to win Best Picture for 2000. If you're the type who easily gives in to temptation, then this is the movie for you. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French town where the mayor has suppressed all forms of happiness. But once Vianne and her daughter start selling their chocolates, things start to change for the better. And some people in town don't like that.",2005
9,"When I borrowed Chocolat from my friend, I really didn't know anything about it, or really what my expectations should be (other than that it's name made me hungry and there was something that was going to be happening about chocolate somewhere in the movie, hahaha). Well, when the movie started up, I got the main concept right away and was immediately interested, which they were very satisfactory at material like that, by that I mean, they weren't trying so hard to get the point through of what they wanted you to understand, they just followed the expression, ""go with the flow"" and that definitely worked out for the unquestionable better for this movie!",2009
10,"This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few. Juliet Binoche is magnificent as Vianne--perfectly cast. Her daughter is a true gem. The story line is completely engaging. I loved this movie from beginning to end. It made me hungry, happy and utterly at home in the mysterious and yet somehow familiar landscapes and plot lines that the author creates for the audience to enter. The writing is almost poetic and the characters are all completely believable and true to type. The chocolate shop is not a shop at all, but rather a metaphor we are all drawn into. I was inspired by the courage of the protagonist, a strong female role model, and the events of the film that never let us rest for a moment. Definitely, this one gets two thumbs up.",2006
9,"This movie starts being a comedy, and finishes with drama and romance genre. And it's one of the greatest movies I already saw, with such a good atmosphere and also one of the most appetizing scenes ever.(It's really hard watching this movie while you are on a diet!) (Juliette Binoche is terrific as Vianne Rocher and Johnny Depp as Roux is so sexy!)",2005
8,"Chocolat is a good film. The plot is indeed very good, and despite being simple at a first sight it have various layers and subtle symbolism, specifically in the 'chocolate' types. For example, for the boy with a spicy personality, bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed, scarred by life,with bitter personality, she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting, and it's definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.",2013
8,"Chocolat is about the oddball in the village, the outsider bringing new perspective. It's presented to us as a tale told from mother to daughter, almost like a legend.",2013
8,"This film is not recommended to those who are on a low calorie diet, because it makes you want to dive into a bowl of succulent chocolate. It's amazing how a simple movie can do that, without even using the scent to lure you. Chocolate turns an ordinary village of France into a sweet world, a fairy tale among simple people. The costumes and the scenery are very believable, really capturing the era and the atmosphere, of that time. But the story is good as well, without getting boring, speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together, the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate, can turn everything upside down. Great performances from the main and supporting cast actors and a memorable soundtrack. All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.",2013
8,"Okay, the film has a first rate cast including the wonderful Oscar Winner Juliette Binoche who plays a single mother who comes to a small village in La Belle France where the rules are governed by a small-minded mayor. Anyway, Lena Olin plays a battered wife who is taken in by Binoche's character. Dame Judi Dench plays a 70 year old widow full of life and she earns an academy award nomination no matter what she does in the film industry. Anyway, British Alfred Molina plays the French mayor. Scandinavian Lena Olin plays a key role as well. American Johnny Dep plays a rogue pirate who he and his gang of vagabonds wash up on the riverbanks and entice Binoche's character. The film is alright and somewhat above average. OF course, some of it at times can be absurd. My favorite moment is the housewife who remarks about her husband's lack of interest in intimacy and she was played by a French actress as well. The film is done well by Lasse Hallstrom but I don't think it's Oscar worthy. American Carrie Anne Moss also has a role playing Dench's daughter who forbids her son from knowing his grandmother. You can figure what happens.",2007
9,"At first, I thought chocolat would be one of those European films that we Americans don't understand because of the culture differences. After the initial introduction, the movie settled down into a pace where it quietly included past European and hence American superstitions and behaviors. Aristocracy and the hardships of labor are entwined with the love and devotion of family and friends. But not without a price. As the characters emerge you will fall for this romantic drama. This film requires no detailed knowledge of history or culture. A great film for family, dates, or just to be entertained but without the over the top explosions.",2005
10,This movie was a wonderful surprise! A great cast and amazing directing! This movie combines wonderful bits of humor and wisdom along with romance and drama and of course...mouth watering Chocolate. The result is a very sweet mix of fairy tale and real life and it all adds up to great movie making!,2000
10,"The year is 1959, but it might just as well be a century or more before, for all the intrusion of modern times and technology in this story of a mysterious woman (Binoche) and her daughter who arrive in a small French town and open a chocolate shop during Lent, which angers the mayor, a devout and intolerant count (Molina) who vows to put her out of business. In a sense, the story is a fairy tale about a good witch who turns a town upside down mainly due to the villagers' fear and ignorance, and does good for them despite themselves. Beautifully shot, wonderfully written, and delightfully acted, the film is as near perfection among romantic comedy-dramas as I have seen in a long time. Binoche is most fetching, Olin fine as a battered wife who blooms (it is magical just for a film buff to contemplate how the actresses and their roles have changed since they were together in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being""), Molina a wonderful ""villain,"" and Judi Dench as a crusty diabetic landlady somehow made me cry nearly every time she came on screen. Fine as he has been elsewhere, Johnny Depp as a sort of gypsy water-rat with a curious Irish brogue is a little out of his depth in this crowd. This is one to treasure in repeated viewings.",2000
10,"Recently a friend of mine watched ""The Beach"" after I told him my favorite quote (i.e. ""Never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never cease to be polite, and never outstay your welcome""). He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.",2005
8,"The Beach is interesting in that some people feel that its terrible while there are others who feel that it is an unsung hero of a movie. When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was. But, just like with A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach grew on me and I had to watch it again. After seeing it a few more times I really started to pick up on what was going on and realized that at the end of the film the viewer has gone through quite an adventure with Dicaprio and co. The acting, cinematography, music, and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters. Because of these reasons The Beach will not die today.",2005

10,"Danny Boyle did an exquisite job on this film. When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his ""original"" cast members... the people that he always works with. When I learned that Robert Carlyle was in this, I was ecstatic. This film has so many wonderful points, I can't list them all. I'm just going to say that ""enjoy your dinner Richard"" was a classic cinematic moment. A great thing about this film is that it's a wonderful representation of a microcosm of todays society. It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to. This film doesn't go from beginning to end. It circles. There is no ending because their lives didn't end. Truly a supreme film. It is what one should expect from a man like Danny Boyle. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another amazing performance. It takes a wonderful actor to be able to portray an emotion such as insanity just with his eyes, and he did so wonderfully!",2000

1,Well - Where do I start... A classic story written by Alex Garland - Destroyed by Danny Boyle & co. It would take a long time to pick my way through the debris of this particular shambles so I shall narrow it down to what I see as the main critical flaws that sank Leo's latest water borne epic 1.

5,"HERE BE SPOILERS The Silver Screen adaptation of the popular dystopian backpacker's novel, 'The Beach' is perhaps not the most accurate adaptation of the cult book, which has become required reading for a whole generation of travellers. Parts of the original book are hardly mentioned in the film, while whole sections are completely skipped, such as pseudo soldier Jed, whose massive role in the book is written out of the screenplay completely. Just as plot parts are removed, others are added in their place. Richard's unrequited love of Francoise is replaced by a rapid relationship, ending with an all too strange sex scene on between Sal and Richard. Good natured Sal who only wants to preserve village life, becomes a sexual predator, approaching the level of Sharon Stone, as she entraps Richard in her Black Widow clutches. Etienne takes a minor role upon reaching the beach, swiftly giving up Francoise, and becoming a hermit in the forest with the injured Swede. Many of the more powerful (or more controversial) scenes from the book are cut from the movie, giving the feel that the director was reined in by his funders. References to Vietnam are abbreviated to a single shot of a fan, while Richard's re-accuring dreams about Daffy are replaced by a brief sequence toward the end. Perhaps most shockingly of all, the books surprise ending, truly dystopian in it's screaming climax, is replaced by the rather weaker idea of the inhabitants of the beach sailing away on a homemade raft, and joining modern society for Cyber Cafes and coffee. Perhaps if this film can be seen as a separate entity altogether from it's written counterpart, then it would be a pretty good film. Certainly the CGI beach looks pretty good, the acting is of decent quality and the film is not without it's charms. However if even the director Danny Boyle (of 'Trainspotting' legend) is disappointed with what he made, then perhaps this one is best given a miss, and relying on the book to do the talking.",2006

This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as ""The Blue Lagoon"" or the various versions of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of ""Lord of the Flies"", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.",2005

9,"Malena is a beautiful and deeply touching film. It is a masterful combination of sites, sounds and colors. The two leading actors (Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro) are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie. Apart from her truly majestic elegance, Monica Bellucci invests her character (Malena) with an aura of tragedy, of some profound and unrelenting emotional trauma and pain which remains unspoken throughout the film and reaches its climax at the very end. Malena's stunningly beautiful eyes remain constantly downcast, and her face -- tense and pierced through by psychic pain (she rarely raises her face, let alone speaks words). Renato (the teenage boy) wins his audience by his incredibly pure and valiant love for Malena (this affection he carries in his heart for several years). She becomes his muse, his courage, his sense of honor, his whole rationale for confronting difficult and disruptive life of the war-torn Italy. I agree completely with another commentator who said that the ending of the movie is perhaps one of the most genuinely melancholic moments in modern cinematography. Simply brilliant. Superb music! This movie should be watched several times to be fully appreciated.",2004
10,"Malena is a film that gives the impression that there are no innocent parties. The men are guilty of dirty, lustful thoughts (and some of more than just thoughts), the women are guilty of gossip, violence and probably more than a little envy, and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker. But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things  gossip and something like insecurity.",2005

8,"Maléna is a wonderfully crafted, mature and subtle tale of dedication, passion and true realization of beauty. The fantastic story revolves around the teenage boy Renato, ever on his bicycle, who falls in a rather platonic love with the town's beauty Maléna. I use the word 'platonic' because I felt Renato's passions towards Maléna's outstanding sexual beauty were mostly of profound appreciation, not just his own voluntary arousal of his sexuality, though the film has many scenes of his musterbation. And all these happens when Italy went to the World War.",2006
10,"When this movie was released the buzz was huge... Mostly because it starred the walking-talking male fantasy, Monica Bellucci. It did the rounds around various Film Festivals and even the most skeptical critics were won over. They were won over by many things... The scenery is stunning, making you feel like you're really in Sicily. The acting is subtle but superb. And it's this that is most shocking. Monica Bellucci was, when this film was released, a model-turning-actress. No-one expected her to actually be good, and we were right, she wasn't good... she is amazing in this film!! Bellucci has very little dialogue, she has to use body language and facial expressions... most people would agree this is much more difficult. Since this film, she has gone on to be Italy's most successful acting export for years. With roles in Matrix 2 & 3, Tears Of The Sun, and the truly ground-breaking Irreversible, she has proved herself time and time again! What her character goes through is heartbreaking and, through Bellucci's acting and the wonderful performance given by protagonist narrator Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), we experience everything she does.",2004
9,"Saw this in 2000 at a special Italian consulate screening in LA at which Tornatore spoke afterwards (and before a directors cut of Cinema Paradiso). After reading so many critical reviews I just wanted to note that Tornatore describes this film not as a ""coming of age"" picture (that in essence is what Paradiso is) but rather an allegory of Italy's foray into war and fascism as seen through the eyes of an innocent (in this case Tornatore himself).  Malena represents all that Italy was and is to him, both beautiful, easily misled, and misunderstood, and the climatic scene in which she is beaten down is in essence what happened to the country post Mussolini and WWII.  Watch it again with this concept in mind and your view of the film will dramatically alter.",2002

9,"Sicily, 1940. A teenage boy (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is initiated into manhood when his friends introduce him to the glories of Malena (Monica Belluci), the most beautiful woman in town. Sulfaro becomes obsessed, following her wherever she goes on his bike, and he even spies on her in her home. His obsession is not the only one, as much as he wishes and wants to believe it were - the whole town worships her. Every man wants to have her, and every woman is deeply jealous of that fact. And, man, does that make life hard for Malena - her husband is fighting the war in Africa, and the rumors are flying, making life nearly impossible. Sulfaro might see her as a sex object initially, but the more he observes the more he sympathizes. This film begins as an enjoyable comedy, but it grows deeply serious. The climax is one of the harshest, most potent sequences I've seen in a long while. One will recognize the nostalgic tone of the movie if you're familiar with Cinema Paradiso, but I think this is actually a stronger film. Excellent.",2015
8,"Although mellowed by a narrative through the eyes of an adolescent, Malena is a movie that attempts to critique the savagery inherent in the 'civilized' society of men. Through the story, the viewer is shown the cruelty that people are capable of as a collective unit, with each individual playing a small part. It attempts to lay bare the gross hypocrisy and fragile morals that hide just beneath the surface.",2010
10,"Wow, just finished this, totally blown away. This is a shining example of European film. You just do not get movies like this from Hollywood. It must easily be one of the best films I have ever seen. (and I have seen a lot!)",2015
9,"In ""Malèna"" Giuseppe Tornatore mixes a lot of his own memories of war time Sicily à la Fellini's ""Amarcord"" and combines them with adolescent curiosity à la Truffaut's short ""Les Mistons"", all centering on the radiant and enchanting beauty of the title character played by Monica Bellucci. ""Malèna"" however is much more than just a celebration of Bellucci's sinuous body, which on the other hand admittedly is most effectively used when photographed by a capable director. But ""Malèna"" has other things to offer as well. For one it is an exquisite coming of age portrait, masterfully narrated and shot, marvelously scored by Ennio Morricone, in many ways a companion piece to Tornatore's better known and critically acclaimed ""Cinema Paradiso"". It's also nostalgic, endearing, funny, touching, daring at times, erotic is a given, yet beautiful and innocent, but then also tragic, sad and even unexpectedly shocking - the film is a symphony of all those emotions brought together through two very strong characters, the boy and the desired woman. Not to be neglected is the often overlooked allegorical aspect very prevalent in ""Malèna"": The action takes place with WW II as backdrop, where motherland Italy prostitutes herself for Hitler and becomes a mere satellite of Nazi Germany, with the once virginal beauty being brutally ravished. How fast things can change...",2012

8,"Directed by Guiseppe Tornatore one of my favorite film makers who made the Oscar Winning best film Cinema Paradiso. In this film Italy is just about to enter WWI after being dominated by Mussolini for several years. Suppose you were a 12 year old boy who was not yet as mature as your friends but at least you got yourself a new bike & then you find yourself really attracted to an older woman in town. (Malena played by extremely beautiful & well built Monica Bellucci) This 13-year-old boy (Renato) & his obsession with a small-town outcast woman in World War II Sicily make for a beautiful tale. Renato catches his first glimpse of shapely Malena , the daughter of his deaf Latin teacher (Notarianni). Instantly hooked hormones raging, Renato starts following her everywhere, indulging in keyhole spying & frantic masturbation. Though he never catches her attention she is drawn into elements of the war to survive & is outcast & beaten by local women at the end of the war. In the surprise ending her husband arrives alive after all at the end of the war. Malena combines a coming-of-age story with the sad journey of a woman punished for her beauty. With strong erotic elements & nostalgic cinematography it gives us a great (though simple) story & great views of a vanished pre-war Italy. These are the traits of film maker Tornatore used to make international hits of Cinema Paradiso & Il Postino. Production wise this film is a class act showing rich period detail of Fran. Frigeri's production design & Maurizio Millenotti's costumes. Cinematographer Lajos Koltai's gives us a truly beautiful warmly lit screen making the most of the Sicilian locations & the long stretches of the sun drenched port a(which was reconstructed in Morocco) Music Wise there is Ennio Morricone's insistent score which works well to enhance up the poignancy & emotional resonance of the film especially in the final scene. Many panned this movie I disagree I loved it & found it enchanting. Five stars",2010
4,"This is an Italian coming of age film about a young man who was entering his teen years when WWII began. In some ways it reminds me of a combination of AMARCORD and THE SUMMER OF '42--as at least in the beginning, the film focused on ordinary small town folk during the war (like in AMARCORD) and a bunch of very horny boys (like SUMMER OF '42). The problem is that while the film began well, it seems to have lost its focus and charm. While WWII isn't exactly a ""charming"" period, the likability of ANYONE in the film was a problem. The townspeople turned out to be quite vile and the leading character seemed to have some serious sexual hangups (such as voyeurism and fetishism)--plus he spent so much time masturbating. Now they didn't show masturbation explicitly, but the little goomer was clearly playing with himself again and again with great gusto! In hindsight, I would have dropped all the sexual hangups the kid had because it tended to deflect the focus in the film. The film was at its best when it showed human nature, as the townspeople gossiped about and mistreated a decent lady just because she was so beautiful. Then, when she was apparently widowed and broke with no one to help her, she slept with the Nazi occupiers to survive. This and the peoples' reaction to this after the war was really fascinating but unfortunately so much time was spent on this horny kid that the significance of the rest of the film was lost.",2007

The setting in this instance is Southern Italy during World War II. On the day that Mussolini declares war on Great Britain and France, the film's young protagonist, Renato, is given a bicycle that represents the first stage of his passage to manhood.

Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui are attractive, funny, resourceful, sexy and--most importantly (and surprisingly) quite convincing as super-detectives. Their case (involving rival software companies, a kidnapping, and the planned assassination of boss Charlie) doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and Bill Murray is out-of-it as confidante Bosley, but director McG's modern-comic action is so lightning-fast and silky smooth you may be having too much fun to notice.

What really makes the film work is the charisma ( & physical charms )of the 3 leading ladies, combined with well-choreographed action sequences and the tongue-in-cheek script.

It was great action-filled excitement from beginning to end with very likable performances, and was an excellent way to spend my spare time. I loved the fighting sequences because they were so tastefully and interestingly done and the acting was really good too, for what it's worth, like I said. I did think the script was poor and it had a lot of plot holes, and I got a bit uninterested and felt the movie became way topo stereotypical at some parts, even though it was enjoyably stereotypical to begin with, but nonetheless this was a really great movie that I enjoyed watching for what it was and that is sheer joy and entertainment.

Taken aback, Greg decides to wait until tomorrow, whence they are going to meet Pam's parents, and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) is very nice, but herein lies the problem: Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam's plant-expert father is not really a plant-expert (as Greg learns after Jack doesn't seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to him--one of the rarest plants in the world), but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a ""human lie detector,"" as Pam herself puts it.

I was not bored of this movie at all. Gaylord Focker and his girlfriend, Pam are set to become engaged. But to do so, they must travel to Pam's parents. It turns out that Pam's father, Jack is a CIA agent and dislikes Gaylord a lot. Gaylord did many hilarious things which includes losing a rare cat. The ironic thing is that Pam's sister got engaged and will be married....when and if Gaylord can get his act together. The acting is wonderful. You usually don't see De Niro doing movies like this. He did absolutely amazing. Ben Stiller did just as good. If you want to see this movie, get ready to laugh. This movie is full of laughs! I rate this movie 10/10.",2008
7,"Most of the funny moments in 'Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.",2004
1,"Sorry, but I just don't see how anyone can find this movie funny. I put the spoiler warning on this comment since I am about to give away the biggest comedic device in the movie. As unbelievable as it sounds, the protagonist in the movie has a last name that rhymes with a naughty word. His last name is Focker! Why is this piece of information a spoiler? Because joke after joke after joke after joke is made on this simple premise. In fact, it's so hilarious that they felt the need to put it in the title of the next movie! In addition, the scenarios in this movie were so far fetched that instead of being able to enjoy it, I spent the entire time wondering why the writers were so lazy that instead of coming up with reasonable plot scenarios, they just passed off ridiculous decisions in order to force supposedly humorous scenes. Case and point - Ben Stiller's character loses his luggage while on the way to meet his fiancée's parents. The first morning he wakes up in his fiancée's family's house, he wants to change clothes but doesn't have any. His fiancée suggests that he borrow some of her brother's clothes. So far, this all seems reasonable. Stiller's character then asks her to go get some of these clothes. Instead, she tells him it would make more sense that even though he has yet to meet her brother, he should walk into his room unannounced and feel free to root through his bureau until he finds something he wants. Would any person in their right mind ever suggest such a thing? Needless to say, her brother then catches this man he doesn't know going through his underwear drawer. That's it! That's the big joke! And that is supposed to be funny! I could go on with numerous examples just as ridiculous as this that litter this movie, but I've wasted enough time. If I can convince just one person not to waste the 2 hours of his or her life on this abomination of a film, I will consider this exercise worth while.",2005
9,"Haha this is one of those comedies that you will always remember. Full of classic lines that my wife and I constantly use on daily bases, like ""if it has teat then you can milk it, puff the magical dragon, the circle of trust and so on..."" Meet The Parents is full of those phrases that makes me laugh every time I think about it. And that's what defines a good comedy to me. If I watch a comedy I want to laugh and with this one it's what you get. Some people might not like it but then to me they just don't have a sense of humor and that's just a pity for them. You have to like Ben Stiller though because it's basically him that is the great comedian of the movie. If you don't like him you probably not going to like the movie either. Like I don't like the movies with Adam Sandler. I think that guy is not funny and so his comedies are painful to watch for me. In Meet The Parents the whole story is basically about the relation between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro that plays his role brilliantly as well by the way. The other actors are good as well but it's not them that carry the movie. To me it's already a classic movie when I think about the best comedies I ever saw.",2016

10,"I thought this was an excellent comedy...from start to finish.  Any man or women who has had ""rough"" in-laws, or ""soon-to-be"" in-laws can probably relate to Greg's plight.....and to comments of 9/11...I suppose MASH shouldn't have been made (wars are NOT funny) and Cheers was disgusting with all the alcoholics we have roaming this planet .... sheesh.....lighten up!!!",2002
10,"This has to be the most uncomfortably hilarious comedy I have seen or I should say felt involved with in years. The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). A father-in-law to be is not just an overly literal and abundantly-overbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord, and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer micro-scope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him, or about him. This reminded me of my past in-laws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips, ""looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy."" Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower, he jokes and sez, ""Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy."" And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me, movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story, this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiancée's out there.",2009

In 'Meet the Parents' the jokes and the cast are sooo great! I can't even imagine Jim Carrey as Gaylord Focker, or Christopher Walken as Jack Byrnes.(these two were the director's first choice) I think this film is a great choice for everybody who likes good comedies,specially with Ben Stiller.",2005
1,"This film was a very lame attempt at been humorous. The jokes were poor, overcooked and could be seen at least two lines before hand. I didn't have a decent laugh during the whole movie and was sorry I wasted my time viewing it until the end. The worst thing about this type of baloney is that a new genre of film seems to have been invented by some studios i.e. ""unfunny"" funny film whose only reason for existence is to lull the viewing audience into some sort of trite ""twilight zone"", letting them think that they go home in a jovial and entertained mood where the exact opposite is the case as the discerning viewer goes home unfulfilled, cheated and slightly disgruntled. Unfortunately, we have been exposed to a plethora of these films for too long as more and more of this type of banal movie is served up appealing to increasingly demoralized audiences as certain movie makers lose sight of the hilarious belly busters of yesteryear with their razor sharp script writers, ludicrous plots and acting beyond belief. They have become nothing more that ""cash cows"" for some actors to make a few extra dollars to keep them in the lifestyle that they have been accustomed to and are disingenuous to both, us their audience, and true comedians alike.",2006

It simply was not funny...the gags were predictable (His name was ""Focker""...her middle name Martha...they marry and what's her full name???)  Awful.  Not even DeNiro can save this one.  The theater wasn't 1/3 full, and only a little red haired lady in the back would laugh now and then...I walked out it was so bad, and really would like my money back.",2000
6,"I knew going into this movie that it was going to be easy viewing, but I thought it would have more of a plot. Sure, the action scenes are great in that classic John Woo, ultra-choreographed way, but the plot isn't original or have much to it. Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable. After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt. And then there's Tom. His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad. This just could have been much more. I did like Anthony Hopkins, though. He brings class to whatever he appears in.",2008
6,"Mission: Impossible was a fast paced espionage thriller that actually made you think, which is what I like in a movie. Since John Woo, who is one of the kings of the action genre, took over for Brian De Palma, you can expect Mission: Impossible II to be an intense action movie with a majorly dumbed down plot. Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now, all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie, Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent, and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.",2006
1,"Wow. I've seen lots of bad movies and lots of bad sequels, but this one was just incredibly bad. I didn't even know it was possible to sink that low. And it wasn't even bad in a funny way, but simply bad in an extremely painful way. I don't even know why I watched it to the end.",2006

1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists, who would have thought that the hero of the TV series (Jim Phelps) finally turns into the bad guy.",2001
1,"I really liked 1996's 'Mission: Impossible'. Now here is the antithesis of the first movie: 'Mission: Impossible II'. The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. 'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.",2005
7,"Ethan Hunt is back with another theoretically impossible mission. Tom Cruise once again delivered at least a satisfactory performance, along with all other actors involved, but John Woo's direction was a little bit excessive at some points. I fail to see what made it necessary for Hunt to be riding his motorcycle on the front wheel while firing at an oncoming car. Or how about that gun that was lying in the sand toward the end of the film? Was that a little too unrealistic, or was it just me?",2000
7,"If you sometimes go to the movies to be entertained by unbelievably daring stunts, this is the movie to see.  From Cruise's incredible rock climb to nail-biting motorcycle ""joist"" this movie impresses with the stunts.  The plot could be written on the back of a postage stamp.  However, that's rarely what audiences go to see films like this for.  The performances are above average, particularly Dougray Scott and Thadie Newton. A pity Newton's character is underused during the second half of the film. Besides being beautiful, this woman can ACT! It is also refreshing to see a demonstrably romantic and affectionate interracial relationship portrayed on screen in such a positive manner. Newton's race never comes up in the film.  Credit producer Tom Cruise for this one. This is one of those movies I'd rent to give my home theatre system a workout.  This movie succeeds on its own level; however, I can understand how others could be disappointed. I gave this one a ""7"" on the IMDB scale.",2000

Yes, the stunts are good, and the effects are slick, but for some reason they have no impact, even on the largest of cinema screens. I can't explain what it was that was lacking from the film, apart from an actor that can portray a top agent convincingly, which Tom Cruise just can't do. Flashing smiles and well groomed hair don't really make for a realistic super tough spy. Give it up Tom, let someone else have a crack at it.",2000

How does the contagion spread? Why doesn't the girl show any sign of the infection?? How much time do they need to change their face?

10,"This movie I saw too many times and never get sick of it. Out of all the mission impossibles this i =s my favorite one, and tell you why. Let's start by the director John Woo who made action epics like Hard boiled, The Killer, Face/off,Hard Target and Red Cliff. This guy has a way of making action films seem more beautiful with the doves slow-motion . The soundtrack of this movie is by far the best out the entire series and Hans Zimmer did a great job mixing rock tunes that fit best for the scenes. The action sequences in here are pretty impressive for it's time, and consists of using stuntmen/Tom Cruise. I doesn't slow down for a bit and even if it does the story will keep you gripped. When I first saw this movie when I was a little kid back in 2002 and I was so amazed and scared at the fact the disease in here called Chimera can cause the blood cells inside us to deteriorate. If you love action movies with a side of romance this should be a must watch for you 10/10. Pure Entertainment.",2014

Might I also add that the score is AMAZING? The part where Nyah injects herself and says ""You're not going to kill this bitch,"" to Sean is literally on-the-edge-of-your-seat good. The music during this scene is so beautiful, I literally watched this part over like 25 times! Like I said before, this film is not intended to be a smart, twisty thriller like the first one was. It is simply an action movie that is intended to get your heart pumping, and the twists that the first movie had are replaced with beautiful music and great action. Enjoy it for that.",2013

With a legendary theme tune and some great stories, the series was followed by an equally superb film in 1996. Entertaining and well shot, it was only a matter of time before star Tom Cruise would find himself reprising the role of Ethan Hunt. It's a disastrous fact therefore that this sequel is an abomination. More like a badly shot MTV movie, it is badly acted, written and contains some of the worst film fight scenes of all time.",2005

If you want to give this movie 1 star , where the hell does Arnie's ""Commando"" come on the ratings of ""laws of realism do not apply"" films and as for any of the Bond films when it comes to a realistic plot... well. Personally, this film is an exciting action movie with plenty of visually awesome stunts, quality soundtrack and a couple of nice surprises. Where this film does loose points with me though, is the cheesy slow mo scenes and lines. It really does badly interrupt an otherwise great action movie, which you should see. ",2007

Do not see this movie even if Tom Cruise rings your doorbell and threatens to wave his long hair in slow motion as he did so often in film if you don't view it. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it at all. The tape inside the film's video cassette is to thick to use as dental floss, To long to work as a belt. Also This movie is not only awful, it is a total knock off of Notorious by the incredible director Alfred Hitchcock. The following parts of Notorious were completely stolen and screwed up by Tom: Cary Grant and Ingrid meeting at the race track and her boy friend becoming suspicious of them. Cary seducing  Bergman and then using her in his spy work. Ingrid having to go under cover and marry the bad guy, who is in love with her.

If you haven't seen ""Cocktail"", it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender, and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly, you have Violet (Piper Perabo) who comes to NYC to become a singer/songwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos, so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called, ""Coyote Ugly"". The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello), Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade, and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singer/songwriter or not, because that would wreck the movie, but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally, I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10, because it has an amazing story, memorable characters and a lot of great lines, but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song, ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"".

The songs, performed by LeAnn Rimes and written by Diane Warren could not have been any better (especially ""But I Do Love You"").  The trailers (although they are what made me want to see this film!!!) mislead you greatly, and I think that's why critics panned this film.  The advertising leads you to belive there's no plot further than a bunch of scantily clad chicks shaking it on a bar, but the movie has heart and substance and is very positive in inspiring people to follow their dreams.

Eventually though, she sheds her dignity and decides to mix drinks and light the bar on fire like the best of us.

Tyra Banks was great even though I was waiting to see her more on the picture, Maria Bello great performance, and Piper Perabo should be taking more into account in Hollywood because she showed she also is a great actress, and the music, well what can I say this was really the chick flick of 2000 so congratulations!!!!! The only thing that I didn't like was the fathers reaction when he found out she was working on that bar but whatever a father will be always a father.",2006
1,"This movie is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be best at--hyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie. I'm no film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind.

7,"Being Canadian, I probably know fewer details of the Revolutionary War than the average U.S. viewer, but note that many seem absolutely outraged at the historical untruths of this movie. When I watched it, I personally found it quite captivating but always have enough sense not to get my history from Hollywood. Since my viewing, I've looked up some info and note various inaccuracies such as misplaced characters, exaggeration of British atrocities, inaccurate torching of a church with townsfolk inside being burned alive, and depiction of American owned slaves being freed to serve in the Continental Army. (Apparently, it was the British who promised to free them if they joined their forces, but later reneged.) My apologies if my facts aren't straight. ",2006
6,"""The Patriot"", the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence, is sometimes used, together with ""Braveheart"", as evidence of a supposed anti-British prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson, who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy (hardly the stance of a Brit-hating bigot). Although ""Braveheart"", which he produced and directed, was very much Gibson's own pet project, he was neither the producer, director or scriptwriter of ""The Patriot"". Indeed, he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down, reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.",2007
9,"Just watched this movie for about the 20th time (I have it on TiVo) and for the life of me I cannot find the disdain many who have written here have commented on. Last I heard, this was FICTION - NOT a documentary; Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece - Roland Emmerich, a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100% accurate but was never intended to be; just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background, whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil, was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece; indeed, the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....",2008
8,"I've always had a weak spot for historically inspired dramas. I like movies like for instance ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I don't like them because they give me some good insight on what that time period was like. Most of them aren't very accurate and if I want to know more about the real history, I'll watch some documentaries or read a couple of books. No, I watch this movies to be entertained and that's also the most important thing I focus on when reviewing this kind of movies: Did I like what I saw or was it boring as hell? ",2005
4,"Thank you, The Patriot, for compelling me so much to sign up on IMDb after being a long-time lurker. There has never been a historical film that infuriates so much as this one. It is possibly one of the least accurate portrayals of the American Revolution I have ever seen, and this film smacked of attempting to curry favour with the American masses. In fact, American patriots would feel disgusted by how badly the events, ideas and people of the American Revolution were depicted in this film.",2014
7,"The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be, and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion (the ""Swamp Fox""), it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything, it was downplayed. For instance, in real life, he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary, it fails on this and many other points. As a movie, it is a tremendous success.",2000

It is complete propaganda for the neocons who attempt to pass this stuff off for patriotism and some sick idea of ""freedom"". This sort of crap brainwashes our children into believing its okay to torture terrorists because they are the ""other"". This film demonizes the British and teaches all of us to see history through the a dualistic perspective. This is movie is complete bull and not anything like real life. Lets all just stitch up our American flags and go kill 20 British people because they killed one American. Because we all know American lives are worth more than any other in the entire world. Oh and lets stereotype french people and realize that someone like mel Gibson would not have slaves in the 1700's but just black people who are free and work willingly. Are you kidding me? Why can't Hollywood acknowledge the nuances in our world and stop creating stories that are completely unrealistic and oppressive. don't waste your time on this film. go study history and realize life is not black and white.",2009
1,"As an American, I felt ashamed when I watched this movie. How must our British friends over the Atlantic feel when our movie industry produces a piece of historically inaccurate trash such as this? For any Brits reading this I can assure you that the assumptions made by this film are not the general opinion in our country (though this movie's performance at the box-office might suggest otherwise). Some of us have actually studied the events surrounding the war of independence and might feel that the British should NOT have been portrayed as Nazis. Unfortunately they are - despite the fact that they abolished slavery before us, a fact which proves they were more humane than we were at the time but which is lamely demonstrated in this movie. I've been to London recently and the Brits are amazingly tolerant about propaganda like this (not to mention Austin Powers). Luckily their famous sense of humor is alive and well. The whole film is an insult to the collective intelligence of the American people and that is enough to overshadow any positives aspects the movie might possess.",2002

1,"Let us be clear about this. The burning of the church is a lie. It did not take place. The film, not the church, is the atrocity. Let us also get a few things straight about the American Revolution. It was fought on these issues 1. The colonists refused to contribute to the cost of their own defence (and no, that is not a spelling mistake) from the French, which had been paid for in British money and the lives of her young men. 2. It was fought so that the colonists could break out from the colonies in the East and invade Indian territory which the British Crown - George III - has designated as Native Title. Jefferson is well-documented as have his eyes set on the West. 3 In the south it was fought to maintain slavery. Most blacks fought on the British side and for good reason. They had heard of the Case of Sommersett v Stewart in which Lord Mansfield, chief justice of the King's Bench had granted habeas corpus to James Sommersett who was a slave in Virginia and had been taken to England. The Anti-Slave Trade Movement was also gaining ground in Great Britain. The film tells Americans what they want to hear. If you don't like the truth, don't make films about history.",2010

If there was a remake of Independence Day don't bother with fighter jets, tanks and computer virus' just send in The Gibsonator. I'm looking forward to a sequel when The Mighty Gibson goes to all the former British colonies and saves them (whether they wanted it or not) from The Evil Empire...Because this film is right on the nose, we regally burn down buildings with people inside just for the sake of it, we're Brits it's what we do.",2008
1,"Wow. You have a German director depicting the British burning down a church full of women and children. Now does that strike anybody else as ironic? After having read through the majority of these comments there seems little doubt that the film makers had their target market and they reeled them in. They went for the good ol' American flag waving, it's only a movie, don't take it seriously, good vs evil, black and white, don't need any depth or characterization, American movie goer. The more discerning American based comments do not like the movie for many reasons not only the 'dreaded' Historical Accuracy (it's only a movie! Geez) or the Nazi Brits. It really would be interesting to note American reactions if the shoe was on the other foot but then it wouldn't be Hollywood so they probably wouldn't watch it anyway. This film should not surprise people however. As someone else has noted Hollywood likes to portray the British as villains and has done so for many years. They always insult the American intelligence by figuring they need a simple good versus evil story and having an accent, preferably an English one, as the evil side fits in nicely with this. They must know what they are doing too judging by the money involved and the money the likes of this make. There is a disturbing trend towards skewing facts in movies and I for one do not subscribe to the fictional entertainment debate. The simple fact is a lot of people do not know, or care to know, history and they will take movies like this as fact. I know this from personal experience. It's absurd and insulting to the British. The sad part is it's only getting worse. 'U-571' took extreme liberties considering the US were not in the war at the time the movie took place and it was the evil Brits who actually captured the Enigma machine. 'The Colditz Story' has American heroes escaping from Colditz when NONE ever did. Ah but it's only entertainment and nobody is going to think it's really happened. Right?",2000
1,Not only is this movie consistently predictable (who'd have thought a fight to the finish between the good guy and the embodiment of evil at the end?) but it makes a mockery of US History. ,2001
10,"This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant ""Bruck-buster"" action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!",2005
7,GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four),2000
8,This movie doesn't tell you any new truth or treat your refined taste with amazing characters.  It is just an old-fashioned chase movie of the good and the bad guys.  The circumstances and the grand theft of 50 cars over one night is of course out of this world but it doesn't matter because Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie charm us out of it.  After watching hundreds of car chase movies in my lifetime I didn't think yet another one would lighten my eyebrow.  I was wrong.  The smart and humorous execution of the car and car/helicopter chases was a great fun to watch; a good honest adrenalin booster.  Perhaps I am little generous but I give it 8/10 for all the fun.,2002
7,As much as I like big epic pictures - I'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.,2008

6,"This is one of those films I liked quite a bit the first time, but didn't think that much of it on the second viewing. I guess enough of it was just good for one look. Maybe it was the immature attitude that prevailed throughout the film that wore thin. But I am not going to knock the movie: it's entertaining and definitely worth a look if you have not seen it.",2006
8,"I feel that many of those who have reviewed ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" have essentially missed the point of the movie.  This is only peripherally a movie about car thieves.  At its heart, this film is about cars.  Many reviewers have criticized the film's characterizations and character development.  Let's check the credits... uh huh, yeah, executive producer, Jerry Bruckheimer.  I think it's a little unrealistic to walk into a Jerry Bruckheimer film and expect ""Citizen Kane.""  That said, I thought the characters were certainly adequate.  The villain was suitably unhinged and nefarious, and I thought Nic Cage did a great job as Memphis Raines.  He is one of my favorite action stars; unlike Arnie, Sly, or Jackie, he can actually act, and this adds a whole new dimension to his characters that none of the other big action stars have.  The closest comparison I can come up with is to the epitome of cool himself, Steve McQueen.  The supporting cast was solid.  Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie are all capable of far more than they are given here; all three of them could sleepwalk through their roles, but they do a solid job with what they're given.  Angelina Jolie's character Sway was essentially throwaway eye candy; I would like to have seen the Memphis-Sway story developed further and made an actual part of the movie or scrapped altogether.  Mirror Man is a wonderful character, and Scott Caan, one of my favorite young actors from his performances in ""Boiler Room"" and ""Varsity Blues,"" did a good job in his all-too-brief role as Tumbler.",2001

He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story. ",2000

3,"What a flat movie. My friends and  I rented this crap and had a ball trashing it all the way through. Not since Armageddon or ConAir have I seen this much posturing towards homophobic male machismo and testosterone. One can only assume that the writer and director were targeting 15 year-old redneck boys with this one because every line, every emotion displayed, every plot twist was comic-bookish, sophmoric and portrayed in the way that a high school boy would think it should be portrayed. The writing was hands down the worst of all the movies elements. We're supposed to feel empathy towards the lead character played by Nicholas Cage because his brother was targeted with a death threat by some low-life foreign crime boss whose main beef was that he couldn't let his criminal reputation be spoiled by the young brother's botched car heist. Who gives a crap. Wow, that guy was peeved. I, the movie audience member sure hope his seedy reputation is kept in tact! Why did Nicholas Cage and Robert Duvall say yes to this movie script? Just reading it alone had to signal NO PLOT to these decent actors. One can only assume they were taken over by the same 15-year old boy mentality when they found out that the sexy Angelina Jolie would be on the set looking like a mechanic's dream. Uninspired acting, awful plot, predictable twists (the SUV with the ""snake"" liscense plate - didn't see that one comin') all added up to zilch. My interest in any and all characters was gone in 60 seconds.",2001

This was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the Original was far from a classic. And if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. You'll end up enjoying the ride.

1,"Another Jerry Bruckheimer (""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", Pearl Harbor"") loud and pointless flop. Cage with that stupid expression in his face, Jolie who likes to hear about cars at her sexual encounters, unfunny script lines, thick characters, ridiculous plot (stealing cars to save his idiot brother's life), all these in an action movie with no action (I don't even like this kind of adventure with car chases). No direction (producer's star shine in every boring step...) and a supposed to be ""cool"" acting from those who involved in this (only Duvall as an old pro is as always a joy to see). Horrible in every way, enough only for the producer to make a few money from the audience. Avoid it at any cost",2007
1,"The style of a Jerry Bruckheimer production (I'm talking about the gritty action, explosions, and such) works only when it collaborates with the film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fine example of this, mainly because of an acceptable script, thrilling direction, and stellar acting (you know who I'm talking about). When the Bruckheimer style is used as the film's fuel, as it is in Armageddon, Con Air, and the disaster that is Gone in 60 Seconds, it abruptly puts a stop to the quality. The plot is too simple and dumbfounding: Nicolas Cage and his Pennzoil-covered merry-men must steal a plethora of damn-near unattainable and valuable cars within a time limit for a stereotypical British villain or else the captured brother is killed. I've never seen the original film this remake tries to fire up, but I feel safe in assuming that nothing was improved. The star power of this cast, with names like Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Will Patton, and Vinnie Jones, doesn't bring anything worthwhile, anything at all, to the table (You might as well go see their likenesses at a wax museum.). After sifting through this garbage, I found my favorite scene is the deadline cruncher car chase between Cage and the po-po; the stunts and car are both kicka$s. Aside from flying cars, every bit of this accumulation of gunk is irritating to the bone. If you would like to see any of the actual cars of Gone in 60 Seconds without actually enduring the flick itself, I'm sure a few are still on display at Ripley's Hollywood Car Museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Trust me, you're better off.",2006

It does include some of the idiotic theme plots that destroys action films: boring kidnappings, repetitious slogans, and lengthy chase scenes. These qualities should have been put on reverse in the editing room. However, what drove me crazy about the film is the chemistry or should i say gaseous substance between stars Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.

William himself has an endearing quality about him to the audience, and I'm surprised I haven't seen Patrick Fugit in any other films since this one.

As I didnt want to just sit there and say nothing, I was forced to due to so many feelings and thoughts about Almost Famous. Luckily, she felt the same way and so for a few moments we just sat there, staring off into the screen, wishing, wanting, and feeling for that movie. It was so nicely done. From the acting, brilliantly handled, to the directing, never camrons problem, down to the sets, costumes, audio, and other wonderfully placed visuals. Not only was the movie well thought out, but it became one of those rare films in which everyone, boy girl, man woman, could feel for at least one person, part, event. I would reccomend anyone I know to see this movie. It was a chance to take yourself away from your own problems and let you watch someone elses moving you all the way through. ****/****",2000
8,"This film may have just one flaw- it aims too high.  But that doesn't matter in this world.  Here, we see the autobiographical tale of Cameron Crowe (writer/director and co-producer of this film) in his days as a young writer for Rolling Stone (one story I think) as seen by William Miller.  He follows a rock band called Stillwater (much to mom's dismay played well by Frances McDormand) on a Almost Famous tour with rockers, groupies and bandaids. Real sweetness comes when the worlds of Miller and the band combine and dramedy kicks in.  Quite the Crowe picture, one of his best ones, that takes a look at the days of rock when it was still cool to do drugs, have sex and be cool singing Elton John in a bus (that scene was the highlight).  Band members include Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and others including Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, and in a exceptional performance, the free spirited Penny Lane played by Kate Hudson.

For a start it is very boring, following the not very interesting or even rock and roll adventures of a very well behaved rock group and a journalist with the world's longest deadline trying to pen an article about them. there are groupies whom we never see having sex, very little drug taking, not much boozing, but most clankingly of all a love story between a child, a guitarist and the apparently irresistible Penny Lane, who I guess is supposed to be enigmatic but is really just vapid and if Hudson's performance is all it takes to get an Oscar nomination then get you daughter on the stage Mrs Robinson, it's there for the taking.",2003

The songs are great, the scenery are great, and especially the direction of this movie is way beyond any I've seen this year. It rocks your brain and just seeps through the arteries and live there.

William Miller, the main character it's only 15years old and already lived more that most of us! Yeah! it's movie.... but it could also happened to you, does't matter if you like rock, if you like laws or pets... the thing is ""start living your life now"" (and it isn't a cliché), not tomorrow but this very second and be honest with yourself.

Its about how a group of people called ""Housemates"" live in a ""house"" and are isolated from any sorts of technology for the summer to compete against each other to win the HOH(head of household) and the power of veto thru numerous of competitions. The house guest who wins HOH will have the right to nominate two houesguests to be evicted out from the house. With the power of veto, the holder of it could choose to use it on one of the evictees to save them from possible eviction. The same process occurs every week until one is left standing and 500,000 dollars richer. I started watching Big Brother around 3 years ago, and I have seen many improvements and twists added to the show. Like last year, when 12-14 house guests were playing secretly with their friend/boyfriend/girlfriend/best friend etc. Last years edition I consider one of the best, because of the ""Cat with 9 lives"" James who had won the power of veto a recorded 4 times. Also Kaysar and Jannele were terrific players, because Kaysar was a fan favorite and the ""brains"" of Big Brother 6. As Jannele was a combination of Kaysar and James. Another memorable Big Brother moment was Nakomis's 6 finger plan, also known as backdooring, where she finally got Jase evicted from the house. This show is really great to watch because its fun to watch how people will do anything for 500,000 dollars, which include lieing, backstabbing, back dooring, and the list goes on. If you want to watch Big Brother 7 All Stars tune in on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays at 8 o clock on CBS on the West Coast.

At first, its badness was almost amusing--the train wreck you couldn't help but watch. Then, it just got pitiful because the characters were trite, one and all.

They also have to perform in various competitions which can keep them safe until the next week or save them if they are ""on the block."" And a few have tedious ""showmances."" Other than that, the show is totally devoid of content. The house guests seem to never engage in intelligent conversations or to even discuss anything interesting. They don't talk about art, history, politics, theater, classic films, or books. But, they sit day after day talking about nonsense that almost never moves beyond who should ""go home"" next or who should be ""back doored."" The show is an excruciating insult to intelligence.

As house guests saw the first go boom, they all were wondering if they were nominated by alliances as a ""pawn"" or really up to be evicted. I think as people saw themselves put on the block, and their allies were telling them they were safe there, so that there were enough Houseguests to play out the odds of winning the Power of Veto to save them, and then, use it on them to put the person they really wanted to see go out, on the block. If they didn't have the reassurance from the allies that they were safe, then they were wondering if they were really put up on the block by the other side.

Yes, this movie has a TON of gross out jokes that make Something About Mary seem like Sesame Street. The gross out jokes will no doubt make many people uncomfortable.  In retrospect, this movie should have probably been NC-17, but it was really pretty harmless. (the girl-in-the-movie-theater-talking-on-the-phone bit should have been done a long time ago) The stereotyping is pretty bad, but again, harmless. I was more or less shocked at the material, rather than offended. There could have been less Scream spoofs and more ""old-school"" horror jokes, but I wouldn't trade the Doofy material for anything.  Great impersonation! Cheri Oteri was a wonderful presence, in a great Blair Witch knockoff.  The ghostface killer does a nifty little Friday the 13th music impression. And, there is a very brief Halloween spoof with Cindy in the classroom. The sex jokes were way over-the-top but pretty darn clever.  After seeing Me, Myself, and Irene (which was god-awful, especially if you're used to seeing Jim Carrey doing good movies) I was thrilled to leave Scary Movie thoroughly pleased.

I thought the first Scream was funny, original, scary, and witty. after seeing the first one several times, I was so excited to see the second. But, i came out a little disappointed. There was no way, you could've guessed one of the killers. I found that the killers were minor characters, as in Scream1 they were not main, but have good screen time, and was not that scary. But, the more i watched the movie, the more i liked it. So, by the time i heard about the third in the Scream series, I was counting down the days till it came out. I ended up seeing it the day after it came out with my best friend. I found that it was scary, original, and had some really good fight scenes and unforgettable characters (PARKER POSEY'S ""JENNIFER JOLIE""). The voice changer this time was really unique and very clever. I also thought the buddy/hatred-ness  between Courteney Cox and Parker Posey was hysterical. Mainly i thought Parker fueled most of the movie with her comedic preformances. I thought the ending at Roman's birthday was truly the best. And i was also surprised to see Jenny McCarthy give such a good performance for just the short time she was in it. David Arquette also gave a good performance, along with the rest of the cast.  Neve Campbell was great with her lines like ""It's your turn to scream, ***hole!"" and ""You want me, mother******, come and get me!"" I found those to be effective if not cliched. So, if you are a fan  (or not) of the Scream series, you MUST, i repeat, MUST see this movie. I will guarantee you will have a good time watching it, as i did. 10/10",2000

Dewey is also on the scene as a type of helper on the set.  One by one the cast of the film turn up murdered according to script.  The old hollywood mansion as the final scene makes a great setting as the surprise twist-final deaths take place.  Definately a satisfactory ending that kinda wraps it all up, with some great cameo appearances especially with the video of Randy that was a great touch to keep the 'trilogy-movie buff' type of thing in the movie. The movie goes back to its roots and fills in all the little holes of the first one. Of course the movie may have been a little better with Kevin Williamson's touch but overall it was still great.  I went into the movie without having very high expectations at all.  I am a very big fan of the original Scream, yet going into Scream 2 I was expecting it to be very good and I was extremely disappointed with the outcome.  So going into Scream 3 I just didn't set myself up for the disappointment.  But I was very very pleased it was AWESOME Go see this movie if you are a fan of the original.",2000
8,"Scream 3 is the final chapter of the Scream trilogy - a series of films that not only mocks and lampoons on other films, but also mocks itself.",2005
10,"Altough Scream 3 is not the best of the SCREAM trilogy, it is still very entertaining and great to watch. Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, and Neve Campbell perform just as wonderful as they did in the last two. It had its twists and turns, and the ending is surprising. Scream 3 is a clever, scary, thrilling, and entertaining concluding chapter. It is a great ending to the much loved SCREAM trilogy.",2002
9,"Scream has to be one of the best endings to a trilogy in trilogy history. The film has humor and lots of pop culture references which is cool. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox are all good and the film has some geuine scare moments. Jamie Kennedy has a hilarious cameo and for that the film earns **** out ****.",2001
10,I think this film is great and serves as an excellent way to close out the awesome Scream trilogy.  It was very well written and acted and has every bit of the creepy thrills and excitement that made its predecessors such a great thrill to watch.  Highly recommended to any horror fan.,2002
10,"Scream 3 is the perfect way to end the series, with it's bloody scenes and funny humor.This is a great trilogy which I am sad won't carry on.",2003
4,"Yes, that masked psycho with the ""Scream"" mask has returned for a third round of murderous rampaging. The first victim of his wrath is duo film survivor Cotton Weary (played by a pre ""X-Men"" Liev Schrieber) when he fails to reveal the whereabouts of the reclusive survivor, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell)who is now hiding on an isolated estate as a crisis hot-line operator. When the murderer begins to leave pictures of Sidney's deceased mother, Sidney is soon drawn to the set of ""Stab 3"" (based on her experiences from the previous films)alongside her fellow survivors, reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette) and retired officer Dewey Riley (David Arquette). Other players such as Parker Posey, Emily Mortimer and Scott Foley as members of the film-within-a- film join the three original cast members (with a brief cameo by Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks with posthumous advice to survive a trilogy). However, this third installment lacks the real scares that unnerve audiences in the first two films. You can easily predict the timing of the phone calls and the murders. If you want actual scares, then watch the first and/or second film.",2012
10,"I was extraordinarily impressed with this movie, mainly due to the continuity displayed with the rest of the series despite the absence of the series creator, Kevin Williamson. Equally funny and scary, it was definitely a fit ending to the series. Aside from the main returning characters, Parker Posey and Patrick Dempsey stood out as excellent additions to a series that is unbelievably adept at snagging character actors that rise above their usual efforts. The story stretched further than the first movie, but it developed an excellent back-story to tie everything together and still remain self-referential. Randy's cameo was great, and definitely helped raise the stakes for the usual surprise ending. If only all fun movies could be made this rich.",2000
10,I just got back from watching this and... wow. I expected some cheese and a little bit of light amusement. Instead I got what I consider to be one of the best of the trilogy. Randy's advice from the grave was great. My only complaint was the way the supporting cast was shuffled off to the side after a while. And it's about time some one figured out that a handgun might just be a good defense against a knife... especially if every time you turn around your friends are getting turned into fish food. Overall a great film and as Wes Craven's last horror movie (by his own words) a fine way to go out.,2000
10,"Scream 3 was a great movie.  A lot of humor for a horror movie.  Overall it was great.  I give it 4/5 stars.  A little confusing at some parts, but if you are a Scream fan, this is a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. I had my doubts at first but it was a great movie. Courtney Cox Arquette looked a little sickly in the movie but was great.  Neve Campbell was great and so was David Arquette was great too.  Everyone: Go See the movie ASAP.",2000
10,"QAF is, in my opinion, the best cable TV series of all time (since Rude Awakening is off the air). Kudos to Showtime for having the courage to put it on. The most important reason this show works is because of THE ACTORS, who are all superb, creating 3-dimensional characters that you care about, deeply, week after week. It's impossible to imagine any different actors in the main roles, in fact - the true sign of brilliant casting. This is the only show on television, cable or network, that I watch religiously and I couldn't be any more thrilled that it's been renewed for another 2 seasons.",2002
10,"Two men are standing on the roof of a hospital. Brian and Michael are in their late twenties, gay and best friends. In the past three hours before this rooftop scene, Brian has had sex in a gay nightclub, hooked up with a 17-year old boy (whom he will deflower approximately one hour later) and has become a father. Michael, on the other hand, was about to have a one-night stand and realized but once again that he actually is secretly in love with Brian.",2006
10,"Before I begin, I am a 35 year old guy who tried to supress my homosexual feelings until May of this year. Now I have slowly been coming out and experiancing my true self,and ""Queer as Folk"" really is inspirational in hitting so many issues in the Gay society. As sexually active as some of the main characters are they always use a condom and make a point of saying so. The show came around at a great time for me, as I am still new to gay culture and want to become part of the culture, and this series,QAF really gave me glimpses of it, and I am ready to start exploring the many gay bars down in Santa Monica Blvd and perhaps meet some cool friends, or something more? Anyhow, this show is the smartest soap opera type show, gay or not, because it makes you think about things! It makes issues of very relevant topics. ANd the actors are amazing. Especially Gale Harold, as the sexy, manipulative, self serving Brian Kinny, who's portrayal is so ruthless and emotionless at times, the actor manages to sometimes show a very human, soft loving side that Brian trys to keep hidden. Hall Sparks also is another big reason to watch. He gives his character of Micheal such warmth and compassion and sincerity. Any gay guy would love to have a best friend like Micheal. And the chemistry between Brian and Micheal is undeniable. This is the best series on TV! And thanks QAF for giving me a much needed spark of interest to actively pursue the gay culture and be true to myself....",2002
10,"this show is AMAZING!! i love the characters and the actors who portray them! my favorites are justin (randy harrison) and brian (gale harold) because they make the best couple on the planet! they should get married in real life! that would make me happy! anyway, i never get bored with any of the episodes, and it's funny yet serious at the same time. that's why this show is so amazing, it's the humor and the story. just basically everything about this show is pure AMAZINGNESS! i have to thank my best friend for showing it to me. it has brought nothing but joy into my life. seriously, queer as folk has to be the #1 show in the world and to the cast and crew...I WORSHIP YOU!!!! ;-)",2006
10,"Wow, where do i start...i first discovered QAF a year ago, not knowing anything about it. I kept coming across gifs on tumblr of the characters Brian and Justin. It looked interesting, but i ignored it for a long time because it wasn't tagged, so i didn't know the name of the show or what any of the characters names were. But then at the beginning of this year i kept seeing gifs and photosets about it on various blogs, so i gave in and just googled 'gay-themed' series and unsurprisingly it was rated as no.1 on AfterElton.com. So...i watched it, and the rest is history. I only watched it about 2 months ago. I watched all 5 seasons and 82 episodes in 6days. It was by far the best 6days of my life, even though i got no sleep and hardly ate...but it was so worth it!",2012
10,"Queer as Folk is one of the best and most amazing TV series ever created. Although I never bothered to watch the British series, I'm sure it was nowhere near the brilliance of the American version, thanks in large part to the amazing writing and absolutely breathtaking acting.",2007
10,"I am a dummy. I first heard about this show when it first came to life almost a decade ago...unfashionably late again!!! I ignored this show because 1.) I was into HBO's SIX FEET UNDER, to which this show has been strangely compared and 2.) I was prejudiced...I enjoy gay-themed material and always have, but I honestly dismissed this, without watching a single frame of it, as a shallow pond full of muscular pretty boys club-hopping, having orgies and probably sitting around talking about fashion, bitching about each other, etc. In other words, I thought it was going to be sooooo stereotyped about gay life.",2010
2,"It is quite apparent now how much of the early success of this series was due to copying of the storyline of the original British series. Once it had to bring in entirely its own stories so that it can extend this series into 5 seasons, the poverty of ideas and trashiness of the story lines just made it unbearable to watch. It was good to watch it for the first series, but the second series was barely OK, the third absolutely dire and the rest never got better.",2006
7,"I can't believe how many people pick on this movie! It's a movie...and movies are meant to entertain. I thought it was a good story line, very suspenseful & emotional. Yes, there was a lot of unbelievable problems that arose, and maybe the acting wasn't all that great. Chris O'Donnell is very cute to look at, but I have to admit he's not the best actor out there. Scott Glenn is great in every movie he is in. The rest of the actors were OK. I just don't see why this movie was picked on so much. I don't watch movies so I can pick on them, I watch them for entertainment..and I was entertained by this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to see an edge-of-your seat, emotional movie.",2005
7,"When I saw this shortly after it came out on DVD, it got high marks just for the spectacular sound alone. It had some of the best rear-speaker sound I had ever heard. It was a showpiece for DVD players at the time.",2006
8,"I'm surprised by all the hostility shown toward this movie on IMDb. Had I read the reviews here, I would have skipped this well-made and entertaining film. For one thing, it was a pleasure to see an action movie that didn't involve guns and shooting - enough of that nonsense. Instead, this film is full of spectacular scenery, good looking actors and actresses, and some unexpected insights into issues of morality, judgment and sacrifice. As far as the accuracy about details of climbing, I couldn't care less. This is not a how-to movie. And as for the wisdom of transporting nitroglycerin across dangerous terrain, check out Henri-Georges Clouzot's masterpiece, ""The Wages of Fear"" or its excellent remake by William Friedkin, ""Sorcerer."" Neither one of these great films was hampered by such a questionable premise. I highly recommend ""Vertical Limit"" for exciting escapism.",2006
10,"What is wrong with these people who want every movie to be like gone with the wind? or Titanic?  When I went to the theater to see Vertical Limit, i got everything i wanted to see, great action sequences, great special FX, a few funny moments, and not a bad story.  Sure some of the scenes were pretty incredible and unbelievable, but if you want a movie about reality, or believability, watch your home movies!!  I really enjoyed this movie and I am telling everyone to see it, but to see it for what it is, a great action flick.  Some people are just too picky about everything and should just relax and try to enjoy a movie once in a while instead of trying to pick it apart.",2000
4,"How can anyone spend so much money and make a picture like this?   The effects were good but how many really stupid / bad things can happen in one film or one person's life.  If only two of the many, many catastrophes that happened in the movie happened in real life it would be like lightning striking you twice.  Everything that the actors did (pretending to be the best of the best climbers) seemed to go against them.  Really, do you think a professional climber would leave his back pack where it could slide down the mountain?  This is your life we're talking about.  How about a nylon climbing rope that snaps two feet above the ground just after stopping a long fall.  You can't see anyone's breath and it's cold up there.  But the way, there aren't any open flame fires that I know of (unless the fuel contains it's own oxygen) anywhere near that altitude.  Or how about a professional climber (who relies on good lungs) that smokes.  Really, enough is enough!",2001
7,"Usually I do not care very much for mountain climbing films as they usually have a very similar plot. This film had plenty of action with Helicopters flying all over the place and horrible snow storms and also entrapment in caves deep under tons of snow and ice. The film starts out with a father, son and daughter adventuring up a steep mountain during a very sunny day and having a wonderful time with each other. Their father was a very experienced climber and all of a sudden a tragic situation happens and a horrible life or death decision had to be made within seconds. There is lots of scary scenes and plenty of explosions and more action than you can handle.",2006
10,"If you like Action movies for their escapism, you will love Vertical Limit. It deserves a 9/10 rating.",2001
5,"Having climbed in the Andes, Tian Shan, St. Elias and other",2002
3,This movie is a so-typical Hollywood action-flick you almost can't believe it. It seems like the producers looked up this bunch of cool gadgets mountain climbers use (many of which are sharp or have pointy ends) and tried to portray some of the most irresponsible climbing you could think of.,2001
6,"With story lines, motivations, and names strongly echoing the basic threads of Into Thin Air, this movie makes for an entertaining watch. Of course, purists will tell you that the climbing is not credible, etc. etc. but then again, neither are aeronautics in Star Wars, North African life in Casablanca, or archeology in Raiders of the Lost Ark. With excellent mountaineering skills at play there would not be falls, near-misses, plots or anything else worthy of an action flick here ! So: enjoy the action, the guts of the producing team in producing a mountaineering thriller (a rare genre) with excellent photography, but only listen to the pros insofar as not using any of what you see here in real life.",2006
8,"I know the experts have said how terrible this film was in regards to realism, but since I'm not a climber, I'm rating it on excitement level. ",2006
3,"Not only vertical but also horizontal limits are achieved after watching this ""heroic climber film"". Go see 'The Eiger Sanction' instead. It is embarrassing to see how the climbers are portrayed here. They are clumsy, stooped and drag some weird explosives to the mountains. There is also a mysterious snowman-climber and king of the hill who lost his wife years ago and lives now only in mountains and his only food is mantra ""om mani padme hum"". Certainly not believable either. Chris O' Donnell though is a good actor and the other ""members"" of the cast are also good. This is worth 2 votes. What this film lacks is reality based storytelling. There is also a bit of a problem with timing, film is a little too long.",2005
1,"While a number of comments admire the endless action of Vertical Limit, I found it tedious and, ultimately, boring.",2002
3,"I suppose some action junkies may find something likeable in this movie. For the rest of us, and for those who want a choice mountain climbing movie with plenty of good scenery and plot twists - go watch ""K2"" instead of this movie.",2001
4,!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!,2003
1,"Painful to watch. While I'm not a mountaineer, I am a rock and ice climber and have many mountaineer friends. I thought the amount of technical inaccuracies in this film were inexcusable! I wonder if Metolius sued the production for the opening scene. I wouldn't be too happy about having my products(the cams) shown failing, even in the wholly fake way they did it. To top that off, the ""story"" just blew! It seemed more like a string of ""what's the next bad thing that will happen"" skits than a contiguous story.",2001
4,"I agree with all other comments on this film.  How can someone so expert be so stupid?  There are too many gaffs to recall, but the helicopter scene was truly laughable.  The running jump by Chris was a total joke, let alone the fact of him running at that altitude with all his gear on, straight down should have been the only way he went.  Forget it.",2002
1,"The most exciting thing in this film happens about five minutes in. After that, it becomes increasingly ludicrous and uninteresting.",2001
8,"After reading a number of negative reviews of this film, I went ahead and bought the DVD.  I had read that, although the movie was mediocre, it was the kind of film that's great for showing off your DVD player.",2000
10,"This film (To be blunt) is one of the greatest animated sci-fi films ever made. The story is a blast, as are the characters and the visuals are stunning. Unfortunately the movie was highly underrated by critics (But what do they know). Any science fiction fan with half a brain can see this is an intriguing story, and one that the cast is totally committed to. Indeed the actors put on such a excellent performance that you can believe in their plight and really feel for them. Overall this movie is easily able to hold it's own against masterpieces such as Starchaser: The legend of Orin, Fire & ice and other films in the animated sci-fi/fantasy genre.",2005
10,I remember a year ago when I went to see this movie. I think of that day as a turning point in my life in how I view animation.,2001
8,"Filled with spectacular visions of other worlds, Titan A.E. brings us into the 31st century and into a whole new level of science fiction.  The story is pretty simple, a race called the Drej feel the human race is a threat so they decide to destroy us.  The only hope for the survival of the human species is a ship called the Titan.  Only trouble is, no one knows where it is.  The answer lays with Cale, the son of the inventor of Titan.  Once Cale realizes what he's in for, we're off on an intergalactic roller coaster ride.  We get chases in swamps filled with hydrogen trees and an imaginative hide and seek game in a field of ice crystals.  Traditional hand drawn characters are blended in with amazing CGI renderings of planets, ships, and the vast emptiness of space with very good results.  Sure there may be some clunker lines here and there but Titan A.E. gives fans of sci-fi what they want.  Well worth the price of admission",2000
9,"The first time I saw this I was 13 or 14. I saw it in a theatre with some friends. Most of em didn't really seem impressed but I really thought it rocked. I really like Cale's character. He seemed to ""click"" as a normal guy you wouldn't mind being identified with. And that Goon character was just fantastic. I really liked the scene with the giant ice crystals, and the sound effects during that scene were awesome. And I noticed this movie had a lot of Starwars references, but who cares. Didn't bother me in the least---in fact I like that kind of thing.",2005
9,"Titan A.E is a story set in a post-earth era (hence the A.E: after earth, which i thought was a nice touch). Its about the son of a scientist who is thrust upon him the quest of finding the Titan, the greatest ship ever built, and is humanity's last chance.",2005
7,TITAN A. E. / (2000) *** (out of four),2000
8,"The storyline of TITAN A.E. follows standard mythical canon: unlikely youthful hero from the boondocks is forced to follow his destiny and struggle against overwhelming odds to save his people. No surprises there, to be sure, but God is in the details, and the details is where this film excels. I can't say enough good about the animation and visual artistry--it's the best ever. Hopefully this will raise the bar for animated feature films. After forty-odd years, I have had enough of the formulaic Disney approach.",2000
5,"I gave this movie two opportunities. The animation is so brilliantly colorful and imaginative, I hated to give up on it. Scene after scene was a pleasure to watch. It's like a well-drawn sci-fi comic book come to life. It's extremely colorful.",2007
10,"Ah, Titan A.E.,this is can be one of Don Bluth's best movies. First for all the dark imagery and sci-fi wonder that was interwoven into it. Second for being a movie that even Disney wanted to rip off of. Not ruin neither Treasure Planet or Atlantis for anyone, but yes they are both kind of rip offs of this movie. But, they are both essentially unique and different plots and ideas. The next thing, I enjoyed of this movie, of which I enjoy of any movie, is the music. I loved the all the songs because they used my favorite band, Lit. I also want to say I liked the female character. I kind of like the fact that she isn't some flighty little thing like all the other girl in his movies. Overall, not a bad film.",2011

10,"This has to be one of the slickest Sci-Fi films I have ever seen. The plot could have been used in any other Sci-fi film without a hitch, it is that seamless. The characters are well developed and there is quite a twist at the end, although I will not drop any spoilers in here.",2009
8,"As a fan of animation of all kinds, for more than 40 years, this is really an odd one.. ...I do not think anything compares in the way of visuals and special effects, in animation. They are so brilliantly done, that it worth watching for the view alone.",2005

10,"When I first saw this movie, I was astounded by the amount of work and dedication that was put into the movie. I was younger at the time, but I saw how well the work was done. Great animation, great CGI effects and a good story makes it one of Don Bluths greatest works. The post apocalyptic setting gives it a dark look, but comedic elements and a family look at the movie makes it great for the whole family. The movie has its fair share of adult themes, violence, some sensuality, and language makes it great for the older crowd. There is also the sense of hope that people have in order to create a new world that people can live in. I could go into detail about characters, the setting, but I am sure that other reviewers had already mentioned this. Nevertheless, if you want a great animated film, filled with action, danger, and for the family, then look no further. Titan A.E is greatly under appreciated and everybody should watch it, even if they are not fans of animated films.",2007
1,"... for American animated blockbusters, and now I am convinced that animation will remain a niche genre in this country. The Japanese get Miyazaki, we get Don Bluth, hardly seems fair does it?  Yeah, this is a formula movie all right.  The plot is threadbare, characters are vanilla, and the villians (named ""Drej"", how clever) have it in for us Earthlings, apparently just because we're a spacefaring race (uh, what about all the other races?).  Two semi-interesting locales are squandered in boring chase scenes, and the Titan itself looks more like a medium-sized space station (hence the Babylon 5 reference) than a potential planet.  Sorry, but the whole experience left me as cold as one of those ice rings (and I *am* the Snow Dog, after all).",2000
9,"Saw it in the theater, loved it. Bought it. Got the OST. Loved that too. The story was great, almost JapAnime like, but the art and voice over was a trip back to the first time I saw the original Heavy Metal. Much cleaner, yes, and family oriented if you think about it, but still a little more raw than I had expected. Not so much digital graphics, it isn't Babylon 5. For the old skool people who watched anime in the 80's, got into sci-fi a little too much (LOL), and have kids they want to share their enthusiasms with... this movie is great. Gonna watch it again right now with my ten year old, she likes it too, especially Goon and Akima.",2006
9,"Titan A.E. reminds me a little bit of the movie Rango (which came out not too long ago) where Rango proved that CGI does not mean a kids movie, Titan A.E. did the same. I remember watching Titan A.E. when I was was younger and it entirely changed my imagination. The movie had great visuals, and while the CGI was probably a little overused because now the CGI is dated, I remember it looking spectacular back then.",2011
9,"This film is a fantastic under-appreciated gem , and it doesn't surprise me most people didn't like it. Thats because mainstream audiences are getting dumber by the year, as films fall over themselves to try and get as many commercial endorsements (I,robot, blade III etc) and plot twists that add nothing to the story (silent hill). The previous review criticised the animation of the characters but i feel it did the job quite nicely. What exactly do you want, anime style flying through the air with huge open mouths? And at the opposite end of the spectrum this IS an animated film, if they wanted the characters to look ultra realistic they would of used CGI (yawn) or real people.",2006
10,"Titan A.E. is a movie which has been created with a lot of love and attentiveness in the beautiful details, the characters thoroughly developed. This movie is one of the greatest sci - fiction adventures ever made and has for me entered the throne together with another great very underrated sci - fi movie, FINAL FANTASY. Both are great and different in their own. The great creating of a planet as the big final of TITAN A.E. is one of the strongest, most impressive , visually and acoustically (WHAT A SOUND !! ) blowing and also emotional satisfying sequences i have ever seen in movies. Its also a very seldom sequence, since here the ship in a space movie for which everything and the story are around have been lined up for, is acting the end practically alone and leaving Akima and the others as viewing passengers unlike e.g. the ENTERPRISE, VOYAGER or other ships which cannot show what are they capable for alone, without commanding officer.",2005
9,"I saw this film yesterday, after getting it in a pile of old videos.",2005
10,"Not usually a fan of this type of all-out Action movie, ""Romeo Must Die"" knocked me off balance when I found it to be one of the best films I have ever enjoyed. Producer Joel Silver (Who also produced ""The Matrix"") describes the film as an ""Urban rendition of Romeo and Juliet"" and although this is a very simple way of looking at the film, it's not far off the mark. Like the great Shakespeare work, there are two opposing families in this film, each looking to make big commercial gains in the world of real estate development. Caught up in their lies, greed and violence are Trish O'Day (Played by Aaliyah) and Han Sing (Played by Jet Li). The story revolves around their quickly blooming relationship and the opposing families around them.",2005
7,"ROMEO MUST DIE is one of those rare films which, while not particularly good for its genre, is surprisingly good for other reasons. Most of the black characters, even the villians, are sympathetically portrayed, even though the hero is Asian. Aaliyah is wholesomely sexy and quite beautiful.  Russell Wong is phenomenal is a very short role.  This guy has the looks, style, and presence of Russell Crowe. Jet Li, however, is very humane and appealing, though his character is underwritten. Most of the asian characters are shortchanged dramatically. However the white (primarily Jewish) characters are shortchanged the most.  They receive the brunt of the ugly stereotyping. The kung-fu sequences are nothing special.  They are too fast and too confusing to be completely effective.  Though neat, the Xray effect detracted from the ""realism,"" sort of like the old split screen and slo-mo effects of the 1960s films. Bone-crunching is far more effective; and, would someone please dispense with this ""flying"" nonsense?  I don't want to see anything up there or the screen that is not physically possible. Special note must be made of Francoise Yip, the Female bike / fighter.  If Ms. Yip did all her own stunts, she's not only stunningly beautiful, she is also awesome. One quibble, which I feel follows a disturbing pattern in motion pictures.  Though Jet Li and Aaliyah are quite obviously in love at the close of the film, they never kiss.  In a film which shows two beautiful asian dances french kiss, and one bares the other's breast and kisses her erect nipple,would it have been too much to ask to have to people of different races who are obviously in love share a romantic kiss?",2000
10,What a movie!,2001
8,"I read some not-so-great reviews about ""Romeo must Die"" so I really didn't have my hopes up high. I only decided to watch it because I love Jet Li. Good thing I did watch it!! It was SO cool!! Jet Li didn't disappoint - not only was his fighting as 'wow' as ever (and I know, a lot of people think too much CGI was used, compromising his true abilities. I agree with that, but you have to admit, it still looked pretty dayam good), his dramatic acting is amazing too!! However, living in Hong Kong, I DO have a few problems with the film. Firstly, it REALLY exaggerates the whole Asian thing, making it seem like we Chinese all practice Kung Fu in our backyards while drinking Oolong tea every day...which in fact, is NOT what Hong Kong people do (yes, I'm sorry if I'm shattering some dreams here - Hong Kong people do too watch television and shop and do things other than learn Kung Fu. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find one person in Hong Kong who knows martial arts Jet Li style). The Chinese people in the film all have names like ""Po"" and ""Han"" and say things like ""let's show them our true strength""...I'm surprised they didn't put some phrases like ""Let's summon our family's ancestral dragons"" in. ALSO, I was really confused when they showed Hong Kong. It was nothing like the Hong Kong and all but one person spoke in Mandarin (most people in Hong Kong speak cantonese). I'm not sure if that bit WAS actually Hong Kong but...if you're going to say that he's in prison in Hong Kong, why choose a place which does NOT give a proper image of Hong Kong? There must've also been some confusion with Chinese and Japanese because I swear, at times, Han's (Jet Li's character) dad seems more Jap than anything...",2006
8,I was surprised I enjoyed much of this since martial arts movies are okay but nothing I really get into often. Jet Li plays the only likable character in this Asians vs. Blacks gang story.,2006
7,"There seems to be several films in this one. A story about corruption and property deals, a story about fathers and their children, a tentative Romeo and Juliet romance and of course martial arts and guns. The actors acquit themselves well. One hoped for more of Michael Wong and less of Anthony Anderson (his constant 'Dim Sum' refrain being quite irritating) but the actors act, the plot moves and the film is enjoyable enough.",2003
8,"It was four years ago on August 25 that Aaliyah was tragically taken from us and the life of another great musical talent cut short. I decided to watch Romeo Must Die with Jet Li in her memory as it has a lot of her music(Come Back in One Piece"", ""I Don't Wanna"", ""Try Again"" and ""Are You Feelin' Me?""), and it is one great movie that I watch over and over again. DMX was also in the movie and he joined Jet Li again in Cradle 2the Grave , another movie with great action and great music. Thanks, Aaliyah, for the music you gave us.I never get tired of watching Jet Li in action and look forward to many more movies with him.",2005
9,"For those who like cross-culture, ""Romeo Must Die"", show be the one for you! Jet Li who was fresh from ""Leathal Weapon 4"" really delivers in this action-packed movie. Playing Han was a big one for him. Aaliyah(1979-2001), the R&B sensation really got her acting chops in gear playing the alluring Trish O'Day, who is being shadowed by the bumbling Maurice, played by the hilarious, Anthony Anderson. Everybody would call him MORON! Which I think is funny.",2005
4,"I must say right off the bat that I was very disappointed with this movie. Jet Li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen, with credentials (in martial arts, not acting) that rival the late great Bruce Lee and easily surpass Jackie Chan.  He can do things with his body that I can't even do in my dreams.",2000
10,"This was by far, one of the best movies I've seen.Even if action movies are not your scene,this one is guaranteed for your enjoyment.It had everything you could want in a movie,humor,action,drama,suspense,and good actors.The actors,they were just brilliant.I just like Han's cool.Aaliyah was very good,considering the fact that ,that was her first movie.The tag-line was not your common one,where good guys run after the bad guys and at the end the bad guys are arrested,and everybody lives happy ever after.This movie was more realistic,something you can believe.The directors did a fantastic job,so did the actors.Sheer enjoyment.",2006
9,"Romeo must die is the Best Jet Li movie till date. It is packed with amazing fight scenes, plenty of jokes and a great atmosphere sorrounding the movie. This is Jet Li's second Hollyood movie after the Hit Lethal weapon 4. Some of the fight scenes are computerised, but Impresses big time. This is my favourite Jet Li movie, others include Kiss of the Dragon, Unleashed, Born to defend and Black mask. The late Aliyah looks great as ever, especially when she takes Li to the night club. DMX appears in this movie in a small role, he later makes a Decent movie alongside Li in Cradle 2 the grave. It wasn't exactly a Blockbuster Hit of a movie, but it was Great Fun. There is a large number of actors, another actor that provides laughs are Maureen, who also appears in cradle 2 the grave. One of my favourite scenes is when Jet Li plays football, and is sarcasticlly fouled on purpose. He decides to take advantage of the rules and hit back in a Great Way. Recommended, if you enjoyed Jet Li Movies.",2006
5,"Have you ever felt cheated because you never got to see a movie before that includes X-ray POV footage of a person's spine being severed, a football game that turns into a Three Stooges episode, a part where a Chinese crime lord has his colleagues chained up in a refrigerated boxcar before they're murdered and dismembered with meat-cutting instruments (thankfully off-camera), and mentions that the Oakland Raiders moved again? Fear not, once you see ROMEO MUST DIE.",2001
6,"The good of this movie was when Aaliyah was on the scene. The rest was rather senseless violence about gangs trying to out do each other. Jet Li was okay, but I don't think he's a good actor although he 's a very prolific one starring in over 60 movies. Although this was her acting debut, I think Aaliyah brought the goods to the table. She was just great as Trish. The play between Trish and Han (Jet Li) as an accidental cab driver was priceless, and the way they contrasted each other on screen with younger Trish actually in somewhat of a protective role to Han really added interesting plot twist to the story. Executive producer Joel Silver had lots of original ideas about movie making, and this one I would say is one of them. I don't go too much for the violence, but the movie was entertaining and original.",2005
9,"""Romeo Must Die"" is an action drama starring Jet Li, Aaliyah, and Delroy Lindo.",2016
6,"Let me start by saying I adore the late Aaliyah. For her first role, she did a pretty good job. She played the part well and this part was made for her. However, I enjoyed the soundtrack more than the movie itself. Not saying it was a horrible movie, it was just OK. I wish the fight scenes were more authentic. You could tell they were choreographed. When I watch a movie like this, I want it to look like people are really fighting each other. I also felt that Jet Li and Aaliyah lacked in the chemistry department. Sure, they look good together as friends and/or partners in crime, but nothing more and I mean nothing. Anything beyond that seemed forced. I actually felt the entire cast lacked in chemistry. There were a couple of twists that were unexpected and the plot was OK, but nothing to really knock your socks off. It is entertaining if nothing else is on TV, or if you just want to watch the beautiful Aaliyah in action. For me, it is a bit nostalgic for that reason. Also, I was still a teenager when this came out and this was the movie to watch at that time. Again, not the worst movie, but not the best. I will admit that I have probably watched this at least 5 times. Sometimes, I just can't say no because although it is not perfect, it is still entertaining.",2016
8,"This is a pretty intriguing and action-packed movie starring Jet Li in one of his first Hollywood appearances. His plays former Chinese cop Han Sing who breaks out of prison after hearing of his brother's murder in Oakland. When he gets there, he gets entangled in a money scheme plot involving two rival families, where the daughter of a crime lord, Trish O'Day (Aaliyah), is also caught in the middle.",2015
9,"I don't know, maybe I'm biased (even though I can't imagine why I would be), but I can watch this movie over and over again. I know it's not perfect by any means (hence, I gave it a 9 out of 10), but if you have a somewhat decent imagination, I'm positive you can really get into the movie and enjoy it. Aliyah (I'm sorry if I spelled her name incorrectly) played an amazing role; it's such a shame to remember what happened to her. Between the acting, fight scenes, and DEFINITELY some good music, it was overall a great movie to watch. It came out when I was in college and the soundtrack was blasting in my car all over Baltimore! Enjoy it and let us know what you think!!!",2007
8,"Of course I say that because she is my favorite artist. RIP Babygirl. So, getting back to the film. I was a little shocked. It was pretty good. I don't like computer effects. Especially the obvious fake ones. But I think the film in a way needed it to give it tension and suspense. Great performance by Aaliyah and Jet Li. ",2003
7,"""Romeo Must Die"" stars Jet Li as Hang Sing.He is a cop that was framed for a crime that did not commit and winds up being locked in a Hong Kong prison.Finding out that his brother has just been murdered,he breaks out and goes to America seeking vengeance on his brother's murder because that is where the murder took place.That is when we meet Trish O'Day,played by singer Aaliyah.She becomes Han's love interest which.Trish's family seems controlling and Trish seems to have no freedom of her own.Eventually Han and Trish get involved in alot of trouble involving some really great fight scenes.Some of the fight scenes involve special effects like the one in ""The Matrix"".Although ""The Matrix"" had fight scenes done with effects because it was necessary,this was not.But it still looks pretty cool although I would have liked to have seen the fight scenes done without the use of special effects.""Romeo Must Die"" is an enjoyable action film that I found very watchable and Jet li takes charge of the movie.Aaliyah,who had sadly been killed in a plane crash was really great in the film and was set to star in another Joel Silver production which were two sequels to ""The Matrix"".Watching these films can be an entertaining film and although this film is not the best of the Jet Li films,I consider it one of the best.""Romeo Must Die"" is a movie that I would have no trouble seeing again.",2001
7,"Let's clarify this title early on - it's not about Zombies. Waking the Dead is a BBC series that focuses on a cold case murder squad. They probably could have chosen a better title, because I passed over this show multiple times after seeing the word ""dead"" and thinking ""waking"" was ""walking."" (That was before I got my new glasses.)",2014
9,"I'd give this series a 10 minus if I could. This series is so compelling, I lack the words to express it. And that's saying something for me.",2007
10,"Now 14 years old,""Waking the dead"" continues to reign supreme in what has become a very overcrowded field - the TV forensic/cop show. It has always had a terrific ensemble cast and despite losing actors of the quality of Miss Claire Goose and Miss Holly Aird around the halfway mark it has maintained its momentum in a way few long - running TV series have managed. It benefits greatly from a superb double- act from the leads,Miss Sue Johnston and Mr Trevor Eve as the forensic psychologist and the boss cop,ostensibly a chalk and cheese combination,but one in which each one complements the other although they often violently disagree. As Peter Boyd Mr Eve is passionate and eager to pursue justice sometimes careless of the rules of evidence and procedure in doing so. As Grace Foley,Miss Johnston is more analytical,takes a step back to see the bigger picture and reins Boyd in when he threatens to get out of control. We know nothing of Dr Foley's personal life,but Boyd's is,predictably, disastrous with a son who goes missing from home and,as the series develops,begins to play a big part in his father's professional life,causing him to have more sympathy with disaffected young people than he might otherwise have had. Over the seasons many fine and well - known performers have appeared to much advantage,but the core of the programme remains Boyd's squad of sometimes disparate but always intuitive and dedicated people. The only caveat I have is that sometimes the camera dwells with lipsmacking relish a little too long at the bodies of Boyd's clients,particularly in the later episodes.Apart from that,""Waking the dead"" is ,for me,a completely positive experience and still the one to beat for the many similar shows that have followed it.",2014
1,"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!",2009
5,"A highly regarded series from our friends at BBC. Good reviews, good numbers. And it tries very, very hard. A better written 'Cold Case' (CBS, USA, 2003 - present), each plot is developed over two hour-long episodes. And though it falls into the police procedure genre, the characters don't spout passages from text books, ala CSI (in its various incarnations) and Criminal Minds.",2007

10,If there was a show that ended before its time it was Waking the Dead.,2015
9,"Great cop vs senior officers vs co-workers while solving ice cold to Luke-warm cold cases. Boyd (Eve), overseer of this unique ensemble, is charged with re-investigating cold cases, yet somehow they are often (mysteriously) tasked cases where not even the bodies are cold. In an episode, that shouldn't be all that surprising, Boyd brings a case to the team where the accused pleaded guilty and is just about to be released for time served. If he had friends, this is where he would of lost them. Eve's character, Boyd would make a perfect subject for a case study of Aspergers in adults. His inability to communicate, tendency to take things literally and an inability to understand social rules and body language makes him almost impossible to befriend and Very difficult to work for or with. As an unappreciative, impatient, & arrogant boss, it's surprising his entire team (aka co-cast members) stays by his side for 4 complete seasons. Then, sudden & unexplained cast/team member changes, we see 2 series regulars leave and 2 new ones push & fight their way onto the team against Boyd's force of nature personalty trying to keep them out. Despite some frustration, it's the most thought-provoking, unpredictable, & addicting long running ""cop"" drama developed in many years. Luckily, it's available for binge watching!",2015
10,This show is excellent.,2014
8,"I came across some DVDs of earlier seasons. After watching a few episodes It got me thinking about the writers/directors of the series and the way they developed their characters. What were they thinking? What I fail to understand is how did an insensitive, perpetually angry Boyd ever get promoted to be a detective superintendent. At no instance has it been shown that he possesses any special deductive skills nor any radical ideas which led to solving a case. In an organization like law enforcement agency working as a team is very critical. Not jumping to conclusions and especially loosing your cool at the slightest provocation I would consider as prerequisites. Boyd fails on both these accounts.",2009
9,Just came across this show the other day & I haven't been able to stop watching since. A very well written & acted show. The cases are all very interesting & the actors are playing their roles very believable & well. Can't believe I've never heard of this show before cause it's really good & I'm sure plenty of people loved it & still do.,2014
8,"I find this BBC-series exciting and occasionally breathtaking. The actors are great, and I can think of only one objection: How can it be possible for the character Frankie Wharton to have so many different talents? She is an forensic expert, but at the same time she is a mechanical wizard and also she is very knowledgeable on computing matters. It annoys me somewhat, but of course, it would be difficult for the series to have more main characters. ",2006
5,"Twice in the last few years I have given this show a chance--viewings at least two years apart. Both times, same reaction. The show is the most Americanized (NCIS, The Shield (The Shield, however, does have compensatory features) etc. ad nauseam) Brit cop show that ever worked its insidious way onto the screen and into the hearts of many people who like to be mindlessly silenced by a show that depends almost solely on a kind of smart aleck quick pace that leaves no time for character development, thematic development, plot development. This show throws images and speech at you at a cyper speed that first baffles, then disgusts, and then reaches the apogee of t.v. non-sense--we've made it through the episode and something must have happened because we have good acting, seemingly a compelling plot and interesting stories--not.",2010

8,"Arnies films fall into many categories, he has his best films (Terminator series, Predator, True Lies, etc.) his average movies (Commando, Red Heat, The Running Man, etc.) and of course there's his bad movies (Red Sonja, Raw Deal, Jingle all the way, etc.). The 6th Day is somewhere between his average and his best movies, and is a must for all Arnie fans.",2005
10,"Surprisingly, this was an excellent movie and certainly one that extends beyond simply being in the action genre.  The 6th Day grapples with the ethics behind cloning and the broad spectrum of implications cloning could have on our everyday lives.  While yes, the movie near the end becomes pretty action-oriented, it is a very smart movie overall, and it certainly merits one's attention.",2001
7,I was pleasantly surprised with how good the not very favorably reviewed 6th day was. It delivered in several ways:,2011
8,"Impersonated by ""Impostor,"" 2002, this production is far superior in many ways. The casting was excellent; many of the main players having had only obscure parts until now, lent a crisp freshness to the production. Even with a few of them lacking in experience, these performances were completely professional and the characters were developed along the way well enough to enable the audience to care about what events occur.",2003
7,"In the near future, cloning technology is highly developed and the corporation Replacement Technologies owned by the wealthy Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) is responsible for cloning pets in RePet shops. However there is a law called Sixth Day that prohibits human cloning and many groups and movements that are against any type of cloning. When Drucker needs to travel to a remote location, he hires the professional helicopter pilots Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his friend Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport), requesting an eye test from them first. However Hamk flies since it is Adam's birthday; the family dog has just died and he is thinking about the possibility of cloning the animal for his daughter. Adam decides to by a doll called Cindy instead but when he arrives home, he finds that Oliver and he have been cloned. Further, he is hunted down by four professional killers and he needs to flee. What happened to Adam and why was he cloned?",2017
8,"That film is not a masterpiece, for sure, even as an action film. But this film goes along with many films with Schwarzenegger that are dealing with the future. We of course think at once of Terminator. But it also deals with another theme that is popular with him: the use of technology and science to enslave humanity, I mean true real human beings. At times this ""technology and science"" is coming from outer space like in Predator. In this case, like in Total Recall or The Running Man it is coming from humans themselves. In this case it goes slightly further than in other cases. We are not speaking of robots, of the misuse of television and so on, but we are speaking of cloning. What happens when the inventor of a new technology that enables the cloning of a man in twenty minutes, including his mind, memories, etc by the recording of all that via an eye scanner, is using the technology to reproduce himself and his associates? What happens if that inventor is able to inject into each clone a fatal disease that limits his life span to five years maximum, and only the very few at the heart of the plot would be free of that fatal gene or could be cloned again without it? The story of course does not answer these questions really because Adam Gibson (a good old name for the one who will regenerate the creation of God, the creation of the first Adam on the sixth day of his work) self-appoints himself as the one who is going to clean up the plate and he does. The details are in the film. The film adds on this plate the fact that Adam Gibson had been by mistake cloned and then two Adam Gibsons have to cooperate and to survive together, a good lesson of humanity for which the family is the inalienable unit that any man in this family has to defend. Slightly man-centered, but that is no real accident. The man portrayed here is slightly old-fashioned. That's why he is against cloning and that's why he is a slight but gallant male chauvinist. Just watch the film for the action and do not compare with memories of yours. This film borrows a lot from various other films or from novels.",2010
9,THE 6TH DAY / (2000) **** (out of four) ,2001
8,"A good movie for DVD with terrific 5.1sound and sharp visuals, this was another entertaining Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. The action isn't overdone and the humor is subtle.",2006
7,"""The 6th Day"" is a rarity: an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle with a plot (with a great reversal in the middle), a weighty subject matter, and something to think about. Even the villain is not just a random psychopath - he has a rationale to his actions. The film is well-designed (the world it creates is both recognizable and slightly futuristic), and sometimes very funny (""loading virtual psychiatrist!""). And how about Robert Duvall's performance - certainly of a higher caliber than we're used to in an Arnold film. It's not flawless: it's too long, some of Roger Spottiswoode's directorial effects are annoying, and the helicopter climax looks very bad! But as Arnold's movies go, it's among his better ones. *** out of 4.",2016
4,"The great things about this film are the high energy action sequences with an aging and only slightly unbelievable Arnold Schwarzenneggar. What is far from great, however, is how the film does a half-assed job of dealing with an ethical issue in what ought to have been a thoughtful way. The film treats the issue of cloning in an amazingly misinformed and ignorant manner and rides on a remarkably idiotic script.",2005
4,"""The Sixth Day"" is an example of when a big movie star gets so self-indulgent that they make a movie that has absolutely nothing new or interesting to offer, other than seeing that big movie star do what they are known best for doing. Arnold is know for kicking ass in big budget movies and this is just what he does here. Nothing more. The plot is a lame and uninspired version of ""Total Recall"" and it tries to top it with almost hilarious futility. There is even a scene where Arnold wakes up in a cab with no recollection of how he got there. Sound familiar? It should, since you have probably seen that in a better movie.",2007
5,"If you are a Canadian, one of the greatest ironies you are likely to encounter in your lifetime is the ongoing ""dumbing down"" of the US film industry by Hollywood producers who voluntarily choose to shoot their films in the Frozen North so they can lop a mere 30 or 60 mil off the production cost.(Most likely, the money ""saved"" ends up in fatter executive salaries -- after all, this is Hollywood we are talking about, the place where ""creative accounting"" was literally invented.)The irony, of course, is that it was not so long ago that concerned Canadian politicians were taking draconian steps to protect OUR culture ..from those same producers! Joke, joke. Who would have suspected that, 20 years later incur ""global village,"" US producers and fast-buck artists would voluntarily move their productions here -- and voluntary comply with Canadian regs requiring them to ""top load"" said productions with"" Canadian talent"" -- both in front of, and behind, the camera. THE SIXTH DAY, a recent release starring ""The Arnold,"" is a marvelous case in point. Even if he is a bit long in the tooth, and even if his best"" Terminator"" roles are far behind him, Le Arnold really does deserve better than this soporific ROBOCOP clone which is so whitebread -- so completely lacking in personality, SO GOSH-DARN Canadian! -- that the only real ""action"" the viewer is likely to see is when he tries to beat the lineup at the urinals after credits role. OK, perhaps it is unfair to pick on THE SIXTH DAY. The same precise comment can be made about literally all the US movies done up here -- a billion dollars worth of annual production that voluntarily, without coercion, agreed to waddle unto the bar and guzzle down the cultural genomes of Preston Manning, Sir. John A., and Joe Clark. Yawn! Mandatory Canadian talent in front -- and behind-- the camera? Seems a small price to pay for those cost savings -- until you realize (yet another delicious irony!) just how different the"" artistic standards"" of our two countries really are. America genuinely rewards individuality, whereas ours is a country born and raised on homogeneity. Any good film critic can spot a ""made in Canada"" US production in the first ten minutes because the scenes are all so technically perfect, so correctly lit, so lacking in imagination, that each should come with a warning not operate heavy machinery while watching. And what about all those Canadian ""character actors"" shoved helter-skelter into those secondary roles — all part of that very same purely contractual, reverse-discrimination, cultural Heimlich manoeuvre? Did I say Canadian character actors? Hell, if ever there was an ""oxymoron"" that deserved serious scrutiny by world academicians, that indeed would-be the place to start. And, while we are accumulating delicious ironies, here's yet another. The deficiencies noted above are likely to be most obvious to -- surprise! --other Canadians. Evading Canadian content where possible, and inhaling US culture in all its legal and illegal forms, is ITSELF so darn Canadian that's practically a competitive sport north of the49th parallel. Imagine the irony -- that word again -- when Canadian viewers who have practically made a career of avoiding dry, starchy, Canadian production values turn on a ""US"" vehicle like THE SIXTH DAY, only to have their very own DNA thrown back into their astonished faces. Arnold, we hardly knew ye.",2014
6,Unfortunately this was one of the biggest flops of 2000. Arnie still kicks ass and there is no denying it. But beneath the horrid effects and poor script this movie raises important questions about human cloning and gives VERY good reasons as to why it should NEVER happen.,2001

This one.......and trust me........would have been the greatest blockbuster of this year. Too bad...........but I loved it.........go see it............ Great action, loads of humor and most of all a credible story.",2000
10,"Definitely much better than Total Recall becouse of the theme regarding man's mortality.I just realised something more about life becouse of this movie and it is that my material ""life"" is composed of my memories basically.The memory transfer and preservation span determines one's material existance.THE MEMORY not the body embodies my material identity.I thought about it hard as I walked out of the cinema after the movie played and it also dawned on me that the brain cells I had ten years ago are now dead and gone and yet I live on becouse the memories were transfered from the older brain cells to the new brain cells.I do not have the same material body for ever for older cells pass on information to the new cells.Some body parts faster or slower than the others.My very body is a continuing process of death and rebirth but becouse the memory transfer is smooth,I do not really realise my many deaths.It also turned my thoughts towards the very familliar transporter technologies of the sci-fi stories of Star Trek.Based on that technology if it does come about,one's body is basically killed(de-constructed) to be reasembled once again (re-constructed) with an exact copy of one's memories re-inserted.Scary thought huh?The movie delivers on all areas.Cinematography,effects,direction,etc.,everything perfect!The only area it is not perfect in is lack of overall originality.It was an amalgam of Total Recall,Bladerunner,Ghost In A Shell,Matrix,Terminator and Boys From Brazil.But even with this weakness,it still is one of the best movies ever made!Congratulations once again to Arnie!",2000
7,"Being a poor hen-pecked loser who isn't allowed cable television, I found myself in the rather alien position of being spoilt for choice over which movie to watch last Sunday night. British terrestrial television rarely throws up such a dilemma, so I had to consider carefully which one to select. In the corner marked 'safe option' we had Mel Gibson's Ransom (seen it; dull; can't really remember what happened but am assuming they eventually get the kid back), second was Man on the Moon (seen it; vaguely remember being a bit disappointed), and third was Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 (never seen it; presumably a straight-to-video job). Almost without hesitation I plumped for that.",2004

In my opinion, Wes Craven here presents the most novel and compelling re-envisioning of the Dracula story since Lugosi. As far as originality and a fresh direction, this makes Coppola's production seem like a bloated but tired, over-produced rehash. Yes, Gary Oldman is a consummate actor and a great Count. But in Francis' version, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are totally flaccid and uninteresting. And Anthony Hopkins embarrasses himself with such an over-the-top portrayal of Van Helsing that I wouldn't be surprised if Oldman hasn't talked to him since. Tony almost seems to be purposely lampooning the story.",2014

Plus not to mention great actors....Dracula was so attractive, alluring, and seductive that I found myself rooting for him. This movie was amazing, although its sequels were horrible and very disappointing. (havely because Gerald Butler did not portray Dracula in the sequels) so strap on your crucifix's cause this movie was AMAZING and will take you for a ride! This movie was excellent in many ways. First off, the plot.....was awesome. It was a new take on Dracula without losing the old feel for it and disregarding the legend. On the contrary, it added a feel of a modern Dracula, like he had adapted into out time. Then the acting was superb (again, Gerald Butler!!!! I love him) and also the director. (Wes Craven is a genius). So 10 stars to this baby.",2006
1,"Please don't waste your time.  This movie rehashes the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and Blade (high-tech toys).  I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good . But not this stinker.  Not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the ""kick-ass metal"" some reported.  Only a few times did I hear any metal; mostly it was tortured violins.  Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.",2001
4,"I saw this movie for 2 reasons--I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself.",2005
8,"I love Jonny Lee Miller and enjoyed this. I've read a lot of vampire/Gothic novels - Anne Rice, Christine Feehan and Amanda Ashley-just a couple of good authors, so I enjoy some vampire stuff once in a while. I won't hold this up as Brilliant but it's fun to watch and Jonny and the cast do a good job with the genre. I'm looking forward to finding Dracula II to watch, this has another actor I like, Jason London, so more to watch yet. Anyone looking for books of the genre see the authors above and if you like TV vampire try Kindred: the embraced, great show that ended too quickly because the main actor died riding his motorcycle and he was a good actor.",2006
7,"Not so scary, but cool atmospheric horror and a decent cast make for a fun vampire movie.  It would have been good, though, if the script had avoided overuse of catch phrases and combacks (which seem to have become the bane of horror and action films since the heady days of Schwartzenneger's stardom). Plummer is very good as Van Helsing who, as a twist, has preserved his life for a century-plus by extracting blood from Dracula and injecting himself with it, and in so doing passed on Dracula's ""blood"" (??) to his daughter. She's played by Justine Waddell, who seems like an actress to watch -- plus she looks a bit like Gloria Grahame!",2002
4,DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part ,2004
5,"There's a pretty cool idea at the heart of Dracula 2000: that Dracula is none other than Judas Iscariot, who committed suicide after his betrayal of Christ, but was refused the oblivion afforded by death—a clever set up that neatly explains the vampire's hatred of both the cross and of silver. With director Patrick Lussier at the helm—who certainly knows how to handle his special effects and action, and who has no qualms about dishing up plenty of gnarly violence—this had the potential to be a hugely enjoyable updating of the Dracula mythos, but the film rarely lives up to its promise.",2012
1,"Dracula 2000 (released in 2000, surprisingly) features a cast filled with network television experience. It's got such great actors as Danny Masterson (That 70s Show) and Omar Epps (House). With such a talented cast, how could this movie miss? /sarcasm OK, so this movie is BAD. It seems to be an attempt to update the old classic into a slasher film, which makes me wonder what kind of idiot thought that would be a good idea.",2008

3,"I usually don't mind paying my admission for movies, but this one, damn. Believe me, I wouldn't say this is a terrible movie to gander at, if it's on cable for free.  But if you feel you have to pay to see this movie, I wouldn't reccomend it.  It is almost like a sequel to Bram Stoker's miraculous Dracula which was later adapted great like by FF Coppolla.  But now we have this film, another lot in the league of Wes Craven try to be scary flicks.  I won't totally doubt that there are some chilling parts of the film and it was smart to bring in Johnny Lee Miller who did good in Trainspotting (there his real name was Simon, here he is also known as Simon, weird huh), but that is it.  Overall, the film gets overbearing and it is at points awful.  Unless you watch it at the right times, which is few is any, this is a waste.  C-",2000
9,"""Dracula 2000"" is an interesting telling of the myth of Dracula.",2006
8,"""Dracula 2000"" is a great movie that is under-rated by the critiques. I had commented on this film before, but I accidentley rated it a 9 out of 10 which I had just realized was a mistake. The cast is  great and the performances by Gerard Butler, Justine Waddel, Jonny Lee Miller, Colleen Fitzpatrick (Vitamin C), Jennifer Esposito, and Cristopher Plummer are some of the best actors that I have seen!!! Also Patrick Lussier and Wes Craven did an excellent job on making the film. When I saw that this had come on pay-per-view I was surprised when I saw that the critiques rated the film with a *+ which is one of the lowest movie ratings in the system. I think Dracula 2000 is a underrated movie that deserves more. I enjoyed the film so much that I bought the DVD!!! This is a great horror film with an excellent cast. I give it a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!    :)",2001
1,"This film is really bad. It maybe harsh, but it is. It really is. Poor script, every vampire cliché in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole Dracula. There have been some truly brilliant Dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the ""dire"" slot.",2006
7,"I will admit that I didn't hold out much hope for this movie, in fact I had heard some bad reviews and had been avoiding it. Well, it was the only thing on late last night, so I watched it.",2005
10,"Wes Craven's ""Dracula 2000"" ranks right up there with my other Vampire favorites. I totally enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to anyone who has more than a passing fancy for the subject. I viewed this film solely on it being an offering from Horror Impresario Wes Craven, and I was well rewarded for my loyalty. I was deeply impressed with this film. It was well done in all aspects, the acting was top-notch, especially from leads Gerard Butler, (""Timeline"" ""Phantom of The Opera"" ""300"") and the Legendary Character Actor Christopher Plummer. The cast also boasts Omar Epps, (""House M.D."") Jeri Ryan, (""Star Trek Voyager"" ""Boston Public"" ""Shark"") ""That 70's Show's"" Danny Masterson, and Sean Patrick Thomas, (""Cruel Intentions"" ""Save the Last Dance"".) I was even impressed by Vitamin C's unique turn as ""Lucy Westerman"" a character loosely based on Bram Stoker's Lucy Westenra from the original source material. I loved the imaginative writing that formed the premise of the plot for this film. I mean the whole Judas Iscariot/Betrayal/Eternally Damned/Redemption themes really resonated with me, as it no doubt did for a lot of Vampire fans. On those levels it is comparable to the works of Novelist Anne Rice. The fact that the writers incorporated the history of a 2000 year old Biblical personage into this strange tapestry shows a fresh inventiveness and totally sums up the title. The overall look of this film was outstanding, tense and atmospheric, and the special effects were creatively and imaginatively done. A well done film! I loved it! 10/10",2007
10,"I was telling my brother the other day that this mini-series is for everyone who ever loved fairy tales when they were kids, and I'm telling the same thing to my fellow IMDb users now. The opening title sequence is one of the most beautiful things you will ever see on TV. The performances are all top-notch, especially Scott Cohen as Wolf, Ed O'Neill as Relish the Troll King and Rutger Hauer as the Huntsman. The guest stars get to hog the limelight as well. John Shrapnel is truly menacing as the Governor of Snow White Memorial Prison, a guy you would love to hate. Two of my favourite dwarfs, Warwick Davis and Mike Edmonds get in on the fun as well. Ann-Margret doesn't really do much with her appearance as Queen Cinderella, though. The really great thing is the story. It reminds us how not all fairy tales are fluffy and sentimental (The Grimm fairy tales weren't just named after their authors, you know), and great new worlds are presented before us (Kissing Town is a highlight.). The romance between Virginia and Wolf is truly touching as well. Humour is also provided by the bungling Trolls Burly, Blabberwort and Bluebell and by Daniel Lapaine as the Dog in the Prince's body ('Prince Wendell loves biscuits!'). There are a couple of hairy moments (the trial in Little Lamb Village) but overall, you will love this. I recommend that you also read the novelisation of this series as it clears up a few plot points.",2001

8,"'The 10th Kingdom' is something for all ages. It combines every known fairytale, especially stories from the Grimm Brothers, with other fantasy stories, including Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'. The story is about a girl named Virginia (Kimberly Williams) who enters a fantasy world through a magic mirror. Together with her father Tony (John Larroquette), Wolf (Scott Cohen), who looks like a man but has a tale and animal instincts, and a prince turned into a dog (Daniel Lapaine) they have to save the kingdom from the evil queen (Dianne Wiest). The entire journey they are followed by Huntsman (Rutger Hauer) who is ordered to kill the heroes.",2004
10,"The 10th Kingdom has to be one of the most captivating, spellbinding movies to come along in years.  So many have tried, but few have succeeded in creating such a beautifully woven masterpiece as The 10th Kingdom.  There isn't a moment of this movie that I did not wholeheartedly enjoy.",2003
9,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the previews for this mini series. I thought it was to be a fluff piece on fairy tales.  I was quite surprised to see the amazing make-up, the costumes and the scenery.  All those things make the series well worth the 4 hours.  The storyline is interesting and has a number of fantasy filled subplots.  The Trolls were scary and humorous at the same time.  The clash of the parallel worlds was done well, with much attention to detail.  The different 'kingdoms' were distinguishable and each unique and fantastic. I see definite Emmy nominations and awards here, especially for make-up, costumes, and script.",2000
10,"The 10th Kingdom was much better than I had expected, and I had high hopes going into it!  It was a visual delight with fantastic effects and locations.  I couldn't wait for each installment.  Scott Cohen did a fantastic job as the over-the-top Wolf.  I was routing for Wolf and Virginia from their first meeting.  Dianne Wiest makes a potentially one dimensional character come to life.  Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette shine!  The trolls are delightful and disgusting at once, particularly Ed O'Neill.  The movie reminded me of all of the fairy tales I heard growing up.  I was eagerly awaiting the addition of each new well-known character.  Camryn Manheim as Snow White was a surprise, but she did a wonderful job.  Happily ever after may not have lasted as long as Prince Wendell wanted, but its definitely back with the 10th Kingdom!",2000
10,"In this movie there were so many great things that not only brought up childhood memories but it also brought back an imagination to people all over the world. When I first watched the series on TV, it was like watching something that you could read in a book. Everything looked and sounded real. While watching this movie when Virginia losses her mother for the second time its just so hard to understand why this is happening to this young girl even though it is just a movie. This movie can actually take you to any of the nine kingdoms to explore with them. I really love this movie because its just so magical and so beautiful that really no words could describe how good this movie is. There are not enough hours in the day to be able to watch this movie. If I had the opportunity to watch this movie all of the time then I would.",2005
8,"Hallmark's miniseries ""The 10th Kingdom"" is not based on any book, and given the staleness of so many fantasy adaptations, that may be a good thing. But it is reminiscent of a range of novels, the kind where modern big-city dwellers find themselves thrust into a preindustrial and typically magical setting. It's a genre that has rarely been done well on screen and is usually the domain of outright camp like ""Army of Darkness"" (not that there's anything wrong with that). Yet here it is, a straightforward epic fantasy in this tradition, and it doesn't embarrass itself.",2011
10,"Okay, so sue me... I'm a sucker for any kind of fantasy, and despite the reviews, I loved it. I fell madly in love with Scott Cohen's Wolf; I watched every episode eagerly, and awaited the next even more eagerly. I think everyone did a wonderful jobs in their roles... Ed O'Neil as Relish the Troll King was a delightful reprieve from his 'Married With Children' role. I also thought Rutger Hauer, one of my all time favorite actors since the moment I saw him in 'LadyHawke', was awesome as the Hunter. Diane Weist was a wonderfully wicked evil queen, and Camryn Manheim was a wonderful Snow White. It was very nice to see Ann Margaret still looking beautiful as ever. John Laroquette and Kimberly Williams also were excellent.",2006

I was uneasy about watching it; the 7 hours was quite a long time to be sitting in one spot, but i must say that when I gave it a try I was amazed at the movie! It's spectacular! Scott Cohen is excellent in the role of Wolf. He steals every scene. Kimberly Williams, and John Larroquette were great for what they had, but I cant get over the amazing job Scott Cohen did.",2005

10,"The 10th Kingdom is an excellent adult oriented mini series that is full of adult oriented situations, magic, and fun. I would not rate this series as an all age production as it does indeed contain quite a bit of adult oriented subject. Some examples are that of the trolls who continuously shout ""Suck an Elf"" at least 60 times throughout the movie. Then there is a scene where the ""Wolf"" begs Virginia to stroke his tail, and when she does he moans and groans eventually leading up to them having sex. And one more example is when they are in the swamp on there way to the castle they eat magic mushrooms and drink the swamp water which makes them hallucinate and hear Procal Harum's ""A Whiter Shade Of Pale"" These are just 3 examples of adult oriented content in this movie which definitely make this movie appropriate for a viewing age of at least 14 years. This movie has become one of my all times favorites and I have added it to my cult classics list. It is good to finally see a fairy tale movie that is directed to an adult audience instead of children. It is a good fun movie for an adults to enjoy.",2006

This year was a bad year for good movies; So I thought I would rent something I hadn't seen yet from years past. I wasn't expecting to much as I had the prior notion that all made for TV movies were filled with bad acting, and made to deliver emotional ""true stories"" or help society learn the error of its ways.",2005

10,"I first saw this by accident halfway through the series on digital TV and I loved it and thankfully it was shown again and I caught it from the beginning and now to my joy I have it on DVD and can watch it to my hearts content. It is simply a lovely story from the very start even the opening titles and music are haunting and magical, John Larroquette was especially good and Scott Cohen as Wolf was very funny (and gorgeous). You just knew Wolf and Virginia were made for each other as she had said she wanted a man who loved food in the first few minutes of the movie. The trolls were hilarious and even likable in their own way and the fairy tale gone bad storyline was so well written it was impossible not be drawn in by it. I especially loved the way Wolf behaved in Kissing Town when he wanted to impress Virginia and the crafty Jeweller sold him the singing ring it was a lovely touch and we were all waiting with bated breath to see if Virginia's heart would melt, but I won't say any more about that in case anyone hasn't seen it. Anyone who didn't like The 10th Kingdom must have truly forgotten their childhood and all the joy and suspense of being told a real fairytale, I hope I never do.",2006
10,"It took me awhile to get motivated to put this DVD into my DVD player to start it, but once I started watching it, I was hooked. I loved the storyline, and thought that Kimberly Williams did an awesome job as Virginia. This was a very long movie/mini-series, but once I started watching, I wished it was even longer! I am glad I purchased this as I will be watching it again for sure. I wish there was a continuation for it. I wish the 10th kingdom series was never ending! I'm trying to convince my mom to watch it but it's too long for her. Even though I knew the ending before it happened, there were lots of surprises along the way. I was thoroughly entertained. I laughed, I felt sad, I felt happy, I felt anxious throughout the movie. Even the villains I enjoyed which is rare for me!!",2006
9,"The 10th Kingdom was one of my greatest pleasures to view in a seriously long time! It was full of humour, romance, thrills, adventure, a great (and unexpected) story line and amazing scenery. Wolf stole the show, in my opinion...he was simply adorable (and more). The trolls were a makeup/costume feast. The scenic locations were breathtaking and the sets - smart visual feasts. Come to that, the entire movie is a visual feast. Most of the characters are strong and interesting and very engaging. These are just a small sample of the aspects of this movie which chart it's escape value off the map. Yes, it's a looonnnggg movie but so entertaining you really just can't wait to see every next thing that happens. When's the sequel?!",2006

A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.) ",2005
7,"Martin Lawrence is often trusty in the world of comedy.  Maybe I'm just overcoming his awful ""Blue Streak,"" but I felt this comedy--though saggy at times--was quite funny.  The premise is undoubtedly implausible.  How's a whole neighborhood going to believe that this undercover cop with a latex body that looks somewhat like Big Momma is actually Big Momma?  There's a lot of disbelief to suspend.  But the gags often worked and I can say I laughed about 75 percent of the time.  Some are predictable, like when Big Momma takes a karate class and starts beating the teacher--played by Anthony Anderson--to a pulp, but they still work due to the way they're handled. And Lawrence turns in yet another fine comic performance, with a script that could've used a rewrite but was nowhere near as bad as the crackerjack script he had to work with in ""Blue Streak.""  The talented comic helps keep the movie togehter, with a little assistance from the supporting cast.  Paul Giamatti, who was great as Pig Vomit in the acclaimed ""Private Parts,"" is funny as Lawrence's partner.  We also have ""Me Myself and Irene's"" Anthony Anderson and Cedric the Entertainer.  ",2001
8,"This was a surprisingly good comedy, despite the predictability of it and the typically-sappy Hollywood ending. Nevertheless, this film has a bunch of laugh- out-loud scenes and jokes and Martin Lawrence is a likable guy. He has the ability to make us laugh just by making goofy faces. His best were when he was trapped in the bathroom behind the shower curtain when the real ""Big Momma"" (Ella Mitchell) was taking a dump a few feet away! The looks of Lawrence's face during that period were hilarious! ",2006

It's up there with ""Black Knight"" and ""Blue Streak"" as a ridiculous, predictable and stupid yet charmingly funny Martin Lawrence vehicle. Some of the dialog is almost non-sensical and seems to rely on Martin Lawrence's improvisational, uh... skills. Of course, why nobody recognizes that their friend/mother (Big Momma) is being impersonated horribly, I don't know. But that sort of adds to the movie I guess.",2008
7,"J. Edgar Hoover would spin in his grave if he saw how the Federal Bureau of Investigation nabs their nemesis in director Raja Gosnell's ""Big Mama's House.""

Although not nearly as exciting as ""Blue Streak,"" ""Big Momma's House"" is a hundred times funnier.

In early 2006, I went to the theatre while this movie's sequel, ""Big Momma's House 2"", was playing, but since I had never seen the original by this point and could see that the sequel was widely hated, it was obviously not the movie I was going to see. Instead, I went to see ""The Matador"" on that particular trip to the movie theatre. It took me over four years after that to get around to watching the original ""Big Momma's House"", and just before seeing it, I had low expectations, thinking it would probably be a very unfunny comedy, even if it wasn't absolutely terrible.

This is just Lawrence using the makeup talents used in Mrs. Doubtfire and Nutty Proffessor (which were much better than this).  Very few, if funny parts, and the only thing that might make this film possibly watchable is villain Terrance Howard who is like a protege of Gary Oldman and Nia Long as the sexpot who is the catalyst for this disaster.

1,"Hey look people, Martin Lawrence is wearing a dress! Isn't that funny?  Hey look, there is Martin Lawrence wearing a different dress, isn't that still funny?  That seems to be the continuing running gag in the new film staring Martin Lawrence titled, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE.  A film that tries to pull off the same male dressed as female jokes that we've seen before in TOOTSIE, SOME LIKE IT HOT, and MRS. DOUBTFIRE. Lawrence plays Malcolm Turner, a federal agent who is after a escaped convict, Lester (Terrence Howard), who is looking for his ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) who might or might not have the $2 million dollars that he stole during a robbery.  Before you can say, STAKEOUT, Malcolm and his partner John (Paul Giamatti), travel to Georgia to watch over the house that belongs to one Big Momma (Ella Mitchell), hoping that Sherry will show up to see her big grandmother.  When Big Momma makes a unexpected departure, Malcolm decides to play Big Momma so he can help capture Lester. The plot to this film is as routine as Lawrence's last film, BLUE STREAK.  And like BLUE STREAK, it also has another element missing, humor.  The jokes in this film are so predictable and lame. And to get the 12 year olds in the theater laughing, they also include some more left over potty jokes from READY TO RUMBLE, which were just as stupid in that film.  And to get the audience groaning, they have a shot showing Big Momma's behind.  Why they did that, I still don't know? Lawrence use to be funny on his t.v. show and in the movie BAD BOYS.  Here, he's just playing the same role, Martin Lawrence, just this time he's dressed up as a woman.  When Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy dress up as women, they at least add some personality to their disguises, and make their fictional character seem real.  With Lawrence, it's just good ol' Martin wearing a wig and dress.  And character actor Paul Giamatti is wasted playing the bumbling partner of Lawrence. Giamatti has been in some excellent films like PRIVATE PARTS, NEGOTATITOR, and MAN ON THE MOON, among many others.  Why is he in this film, I still do not know.  And Nia Long is also wasted playing the girl who notices the little differences in big momma, but just shrugges them off. What's bad about this movie, everything.  There are no jokes, ripped off plot, stereo typed characters and stereo typed situations that the average movie audience has seen a dozen times already.  I guess the people who never seen classic drag films like SOME LIKE IT HOT and TOOTSIE, would enjoy this. But for those who love and enjoy those films, will pity the filmmakers of this film.  There is one good thing I can say about BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, it will keep BATTLEFIELD EARTH company for one of the worst movies of the summer.  * (out of five)",2000

10,"""Big Mamma's House"" offers exactly what you would expect in a comedy featuring Martin Lawrence dressing up as an old, grossly obese granny; this is a one-joke movie in which an undercover cop disguises himself as Big Mamma and participates in things we anticipate Big Mamma normally would not do. There are some big laughs involved with the size of the title character, as well as her with breasts, attitude, sexuality, and ignorance, but there are also some obvious audience pleasers that feel contrived. Although the make-up effects are astonishing and amusing, there are no surprises found within this material.

It's a great family movie for the kids and all ages to enjoy. As people love to point out how bad and unfunny it is, they're overlooking just how strong a comedy premise it has, with Big Momma posing undercover in a huge woman's fat suit. Now, allow me to point out how bad the plot is; the bad plot gets in the way of Big Momma's House being a more all out comedy. It's no Mrs. Doubtfire, but it's still really good, and I won't point out how unfunny it is because it's not unfunny it's actually quite hilarious, especially for kids. Big Momma's House is a '90s classic. I love Martin Lawrence. I love Nia Long. Nia Long has a great name for her and she really adds to just how good and fun Big Momma's House is. Nia Long is so fine.

Typical of other disguise films of the early 2000's (like White Chicks), Big Momma's House certainly needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. Everyone knows there's something different about Big Momma, but nobody can tell the difference between Malcolm (FBI agent impersonating the southern voluptuous grandmother) and the real Big Momma. ",2015
1,"Big Momma's House (2000): Dir: Raja Gosnell / Cast: Martin Lawrence, Paul Giamatti, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, Anthony Anderson: A preview of what has been done before. Perhaps the best examples are Some Like It Hot and Tootsie. Title indicates authority as Martin Lawrence as a cop disguises himself as an overweight black woman in order to question a suspect. The real Big Momma has a sudden emergency leaving Lawrence and his partner to bug the house and stake out across the street. They await Nia Long who is fleeing from her boyfriend, an escape convict. Obvious outcome with pitiful comic situations such as the wig falling off Lawrence's head and every other woman apparently having wigs as well. Poor comic timing by director Raja Gosnell who made the superior yet formula driven Never Been Kissed the previous year. What he creates here is less entertaining than a hair gel commercial. Lawrence doesn't look like a female and his voice impersonation is over the top. Paul Giamatti as his partner is a waste. Nia Long is the standard damsel there for one reason and that is to be a potential romantic interest to Lawrence. Terrence Howard plays the criminal. The performance is standard fare with no depth and serves only as someone Lawrence will save Long from. Anthony Anderson plays a moron security guard. Pointless recycled dreck becomes a big free-for-all. Score: 1 / 10",2015

8,"I'll admit that I've never seen ""Waiting for Guffman"", 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline ""From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman"", a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame, critics, for shame times two!  Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. ""Best in Show"" is, without a doubt,  the best comedy of 2000.",2001
10,"This is the only Christopher Guest movie that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for sheer entertainment value, but somehow never gets near the recognition. The plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog...OK, it's about a dog show. The owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough.",2006
10,"In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by Americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous. This ensemble has been behind some other efforts, most recently ""A Mighty Wind"" which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but ""Best In Show"" hits on all cylinders. It is superbly cast with some of the best of current US actors, Parker Posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, Eugene Levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat, even when he appears to be (or maybe, 'indomitable doormat'). The brilliant stylings of Fred Willard, the understated performances of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous movies I can watch again and again.",2004
10,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  However, I have laughed harder at plenty of movies.  This is because Best In Show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit.  The improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.",2003
9,"Christopher Guest's Best of Show follows his great tradition of fake-documentaries which includes This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.  This time, he takes a poke at dog shows, which is something no one has done before (I think).  Here, he shows 5 different contenders (including himself which is one of the great parts of this film).  Other contenders include Michael McKean, Michael Hitchcock, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey and in a exceptional effort as a man with 2 left feet, Eugene Levy (he also co-wrote the script with Guest).  Often very funny, sometimes poignant, and like all of Guest's projects, never dissapointing, only liability might be that it isn't for all tastes (but hey, not everyone found 11 on a sound stsyem great either which seems odd).  A-",2000
10,"This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. Its cousins A mighty wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are terrific in their own right but Best in Show takes the cake. ",2005
10,"Best in Show is a delightful comedy, a pseudo-documentary about dog lovers and their dogs. The characters themselves are delightful, both human and canine. The comedy varies from very subtle to obvious but never becomes ridiculous. Many things will not be noticed on the first viewing. This is one of those films that can be trotted out frequently and still be as funny as ever. The film was written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who also star in it; Guest directed it. They and much of the cast were also in Waiting for Guffman. The cast consists predominantly of improv comedians from Second City, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. The scene concepts were planned but there were no rehearsals; the actors improvised the dialogue, resulting in very spontaneous interaction between the characters. The actors could plan things that they wanted their characters to say but they might not get the chance to use much of what they planned; it all depended on what the other characters would say. Different takes of the same scene could be completely different. Over sixty hours of film were taken and the editing took about eight months. The film culminates in the big Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. There are two commentators: one, Trevor Beckwith (British actor Jim Piddock, who was required to study everything that he could about dogs and dog shows), is an expert on dogs and the local, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard, who was instructed to learn nothing about dogs), obviously knows nothing about dogs except, perhaps, that they have four legs and two genders; they interacted with great hilarity. Three of the five dog show judges were actually show dog judges; the other two were actors. Most of the dog handlers in the show were not actors. The film is one of the funniest that I have ever seen; when I was not laughing, I was at the edge of laughter.",2006
8,"You know, this movie reminded me so much of so many people I know, I think that's the reason why I loved this movie so much. I was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it, but the dialog is so hilarious, that you can't help but have a good time. Basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. Whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out the owners are just as insane. Megan, one of the dog owners, goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.",2005
7,"I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and crew have developed over the years. I actually like this and ""Waiting for Guffman"" better than ""Spinal Tap"", which was the first of the group (and made by Rob Reiner but starred Guest and several other of his mockumentary regulars). This humor is not for everyone. IT's rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not relate. However, as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I quote them to each other often. I find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie! What a fun bunch they must be. I highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.",2004

Some are weird, some crazy, and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is particularly funny as gay Harlan Pepper, very much trying to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara, and Bob Balaban also do great jobs (I can't imagine them not doing great jobs, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who's never attended a dog show, this movie is my main exposure to them. They sure look neat.",2006
6,"As with the ""Waiting for Guffman"" DVD, there are a good many deleted scenes to sift through on ""Best in Show"" (clocking in at nearly 30 minutes), most of which are pretty damn funny. After watching the film itself, I was left wondering why some weren't spliced into the finished product, since ""Best"" isn't nearly as good as ""Guffman"" or Christopher Guest's previous foray into 'mockumentaries,' ""This is Spinal Tap."" What we're left with is a fitfully funny, faux behind-the-scenes look at dog competitions with characters that lack the authenticity of the small-town performers in ""Guffman"" and the washed-up metalheads of ""Tap""--these people (down to Eugene Levy's 2 left feet and Parker Posey's braces) smack of artificiality. While the film is funny and ultimately satisfying for fans of Guest's observational brand of humor, I found myself smiling more than laughing at ""Best in Show.""",2006

The series is based on traditional British slapstick humor revolving around the relationship of family members and their close friends and work colleague's.

Nick the eldest son is one of the key characters in the early episodes and plays a brilliant character who drives his father Ben quite insane with his poorly thought out schemes. Nick suddenly disappears as the series progress and unfortunately it is a loss that affects the program as a whole.",2012

I've been told that they are quite famous and well regarded, but I honestly wouldn't employ a single one of them for so much as a haemorrhoid cream advertisement.

7,"CHOPPER (3+ outta 5 stars) Nifty little character study of a notorious Australian criminal... well, notorious in his own mind, at least. The jury is still out on how much of the autobiographical details of the life of ""Chopper"" read are real and how much is fake... but it does make a compelling story either way. Eric Bana gives a great performance in the lead... nothing else I've ever seen him in prepared me for how good he really is. The character he plays is nasty, repellent, scary, ill-tempered... and still full of charisma. After a violent stint in prison (his motto appears to be ""do unto others before they do it unto you"") Chopper is sent back out into society. With no other skills besides his knowledge of crime, Chopper offers himself to the local police as a special undercover agent. They, of course, want nothing to do with his boneheaded scheme but he pretends that they do anyway. Inflicting pain (on himself *and* others) seems to be what he is best at and he gets plenty of opportunities to show his stuff. Amusing though it may be at times, the movie is not a glorification of violence... the ferocity and suddenness of it keeps the audience constantly on edge.",2005

""Chopper"", the movie, is not based exactly on Read's life, but in the series of anecdotes he wrote in his first books.",2006
8,"This movie was not intended to be solely funny, but with Eric Bana in the lead it was always going to make you laugh.

9,"Not for the faint of heart this movie gives a grim insight into the mind and life of a career psychopath. Many of you will know or know of people like 'Chopper' and most of you probably cross the road when you see them coming. Based 'on fact' some portions are a bit too over the top to be fully believed but the movie makes apology for this from the outset. Eric Bana's performance is simply awe inspiring and the supporting characters and performances throughout are believable, convincing and multi-layered. Despite 'Chopper's obvious mental problems, his manipulative charm, animal cunning and the intelligence behind the insanity all shine through Bana's eyes. Direction is tight and non-intrusive, almost documentary style and i must say it works really well. Its one of those films you very quickly forget your watching a movie. While i do enjoy flashy and creative camera usage some films don't need it, this is one of them. The story is funny, sad and shocking in almost equal measure and this is one 'little' movie i'm very glad i stumbled across, thoroughly recommended viewing, i give it a 9/10. Congratulations to all on worked on this, you made a rough diamond.",2006
8,"Look at Eric Bana, he is a hot, studly Hollywood actor. I know this because I have oogled over him in his post-Chopper movies. I only discovered Chopper after seeing him in such movies as Troy and The Hulk, and I'm glad I did. What a treat it was to see him in this fabulous indie film before he became a Hollywood sex God. No, he was not the handsome, dashing Aussie fellow that American females have been drooling over since his role as Prince Hector in the cheese-filled film Troy, but instead he showed us that he really can act and take on a very difficult role and do it with real grace. The physical transformation he underwent to play Chopper is insane. Imagine that just a short time later he was playing a fit and sexy Delta boy in Black Hawk Down. That, in and of itself, it quite impressive. I've always been a fan of the demented and dark comedies, and love movies like Pulp Fiction, but Chopper takes the cake. This movie has all the comedic violence of Pulp Fiction, but portrays it in a grittier and more subtle way. This movie makes you think, and it's more than just good fights and death scenes, it's really artful. Eric does such a wonderful job making you love this truly despicable character.",2006

That mix makes for a very interesting watch, even if there's not enough material for a satisfying film; it could have been a thirty-minute film and achieved about the same level of success, and it doesn't leave you with any clear notion of what you saw. Chopper doesn't quite work out as a biography or even a character study, but it's an intriguing document on violence and violent people, and about what makes the same people land in trouble again and again.",2012

There's a scene where he is shanked by his confidant, and continues appearing to be in no pain at all. His lack of concern is shocking. He looks down at blood pouring from his torso like someone else has been injured, and then up at his assailant as if conveying sorrow that it should've come to this. Then there's another scene where he shoots a drug dealer and then considerately drives him to the hospital.",2011

Eric Bana's portrayal of Chopper is excellent, and really shows what a talented, high-caliber actor he really is. Anyone who enjoys movies about Psychopaths, Sociopaths, Killers, Criminals and the like, such as Taxi Driver, Natural Born Killers, Devil's Rejects, etc. should really be into this. The character Chopper is pretty much completely crazy but still intelligent, funny and likable. He is a criminal that really only victimizes other criminals and other ""scalawags,"" and his behavior is generally disturbing and amusing at the same time. I saw it on a whim after seeing Bana in Blackhawk Down and this movie really put him at the top of my favorite actors list. The story is well told and the cinematography is unique and interesting. Overall, a very, very good movie. Highly recommended!",2011
7,"Chopper begins with a group of men huddled in a cramped prison cell watching a television that it would appear has been placed especially within. They're watching a programme about one of the three men; that man is Mark Brandon Read, an Australian made somewhat famous for his infamy and who goes by the nickname of ""Chopper"". Eric Bana's steely gaze as the convict dominates the sequence, the film lingering on his expression in close up format as he himself remains locked on a TV programme detailing his very exploits. Through lingering on Read's expression, a sense of glee at his actions as one of his victims explains how the very onlooker once harmed him, the audience are invited to realise a viewpoint, or perspective, of the man; one from the point of view of a victim whilst systematically cutting to the guy for what he is, sitting there in the flesh and watching on. The film is more interested in the figure of Chopper than the news report, essentially setting up what Andrew Dominik 's 2000 film is all about: the getting to know what made Chopper who he is away from all the television and the media opinions.",2010
10,"this movie is truly fantastic. Eric Bana as Mark ""Chopper"" Read is one of the most chilling and disturbing acting in film. i don't rate Eric Bana that good, this is the only film i think he's amazing in. its a true story about Mark ""Chopper"" Read's life, it starts with him in prison. he then stabs a rival and then he ends up being a marked man. he has a large contract out on him and his friend takes it, once they got chopper on his own his friend stabs him over and over again which is one of the most chilling scenes I've ever seen. ""Chopper"" takes these stabbings like he cant even feel them. he then takes his friend that was to court. he gets out of prison and he works for the law, killing people. thats a slight overview on the film but id advise anyone who wants to watch something really dark, gritty and chilling to watch this masterpiece. this is a brilliant film directed by Andrew Dominik, i'm not so much into the assassination of Jesse James film which he also directed. Chopper is daring cinema but needs to be watched........ 10/10.......j.d Seaton",2009
8,"Andrew Dominik writes and directs his film debut of Australian crime legend turned best selling author, Mark ""Chopper"" Read (who can't even spell and claims to be nearly illiterate as he spouts a big mocking laugh right in the faces of everyone). Bana in the title role completely owns this character and goes through a gaudy transformation, producing one of the most fascinating performances you will ever find. A performance that should be as legendary as the real life character in which it based on, is sadly overlooked and missed by many. A movie this low budget and this relatively unknown hinders the level of praise it will receive from fans and critics alike, but it's one that should be sought out by anyone with the least bit of interest because it doesn't disappoint. Bana gives the performance of the year and one of the best the decade has to offer. He truly captures the charisma of Read. He's also convincing when he puts a bullet in someone's knee or head, or stabs them to death and leaves them in a pool of their own blood. Completely driven by paranoia, jealousy and speed, Chopper corners himself into a room and finds a nice cozy spot all by himself. He's pitted against anyone and everyone, which is beautifully captured in the films final moments. Out of fear he's forced to kill or be killed. He has no friends, and the friends he does have attempt to kill him because of the dire circumstances he puts himself in. He has a sense of charm and infectious attitude that attract people to him when he's sober. He's seemingly incapable of murder, until he's struck the wrong way at the wrong time, then anything is possible. Whether it be the guards in the prison, the media, or the people of Australia, Mark ""Chopper"" Read is as fascinating as they come.",2009
4,"This smattering of incidents in the miserable and violent life of an Australian criminal is essentially worth watching only because of the charismatic performance by Eric Bana, whose work here explains why he started appearing in mainstream Hollywood productions from TROY (2004) onwards-the man is cinematic gold, a born star, and talented too. He actually manages to make a scary character charming enough to hold our attention for ninety minutes. Writer- director Andrew Dominik's depiction of this sociopathic individual is not without style but at the end one wonders why he bothered: What insights, what information have we gleaned by dipping ourselves into this murky pool of vice and degradation? The fact that the character's exploits have made him a best-selling author is nothing new. Such material has been presented to us twice already by Scorsese (Taxi Driver, King of Comedy). The icy, blue depiction of ironically performed acts of bloody horror dates back at least to Cronenberg's Dead Ringers. At least those films contained at least two or three characters with some human appeal. But this film's collection of human wreckage is unrelievedly repellent except for the amazing Mr. Bana.",2009
7,"Crime movies have traditionally been criticized for glamorizing their subjects, and often with justice. There has long exsited a tangled relationship between fictional and actual crime, with real crooks basing their behavior on fiction at least as often as the other way around. The Australian film Chopper is particularly relevant to these issues, for it depicts a real-life criminal who has become a sort of twisted media personality Down Under by writing a series of bestsellers about his violent exploits. You could say that a movie like this is profoundly immoral in how it publicizes a scumbag like Chopper, who is said to have gained his nickname by cutting off his victims' toes. To the degree that the movie avoids this, it is due to the visual scheme and Eric Bana's performance as Chopper. Chopper makes Joe Pesci's psychotic GoodFella Tommy look like a model citizen. Bana was a stand-up comedian before being cast in the film, and he brings to the role a likable, jovial heartiness that makes Chopper's sudden shifts to savagery all the more chilling. Chopper often apologizes to his victims after attacking them, and the most bizarre- and funny- thing about his apologies is that they're sincere. In a prison scene, after mutilating another prisoner, he then tries to justify his actions to the man, who is lying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Later, when Chopper's best friend repeatedly stabs him in retaliation, he doesn't even react to the pain, and instead acts emotionally hurt by the betrayal. Not just Chopper himself, but the whole criminal subculture shown in the movie, is sleazy and repulsive, without a hint of glamor. Though the movie's sordid quality, paradoxically enough, is morally satisfying, it also isn't very entertaining. The director, Andrew Dominick, employs flashy visual tricks to effectively limited use, while filming most of the action in a restrained, austere style that reinforces the banality of the characters. Consequently, the movie starts to feel somewhat repetitive and dull. Dominick shows some talent, but in the end, it's Bana who carries the show.",2005
9,"Where the Heart Is is a special kind of movie.  City of Angels, Message in a Bottle, and Where the Heart Is all have that special ingredient that just grabs the viewer and holds him or her until the very last tear flows from their eye. Natalie Portman is very well cast in her role as Novalee Nation, a 20 year old pregnant woman who decides to move to California with her boyfriend. The sad thing is, when her and her boyfriend stop at a Wal-Mart in the middle of Oklahoma, he leaves her behind, and moves on without her. ",2000
10,"This is one of those movies where you feel ""all is right with the world"" when it's over.

I admire the fact that a wonderful movie was created without nudity, very little violence or excess profanity (were there 4-letter words in the movie?).

I have also never cared much for Sally Fields' movies. (Perhaps I always think of her from the ""Bandit"" movies...)

6,"A harmless little ""chick flick""? Nothing more than an attempt by Natalie Portman to try anything before she's pigeon-holed in her Star Wars persona and can't get other roles because of it (a la Mark Hamill)? No, on both counts. Where the Heart Is will surely be labeled as a ""chick flick"", but the truth is that a good movie is a good movie, and a bad one a bad one, regardless of what its target demographic is. Where the Heart Is is nothing short of a very, very good film. The story is original and the acting and dialogue are outstanding. Natlie Portman may best be known as Queen Amidala, but she should be known as one of the best young actresses in the business. She simply shines in this movie. I recommend this film to everyone.",2001

7,"This film is a bittersweet human-interest story with a side order of romance.  The story has a country flavor, plenty of country music and a story that could serve as the film version of the typical lyrics of any country music CD.  It is replete with bad decisions, bad luck and tragedies at every turn.  It is sappy, corny, stereotypical, and unfortunately full of the types of things that really happen in rural America.  Despite this seething despondency, it has an upbeat fatalism that suggests that at least for some of the people, the struggle against bad breaks and hard times pays off.",2000

What can really be said about a movie that can alter your world in just a
few short hours?  I went into this movie not exactly expecting much, mainly
there because the amazing and beautiful Natalie Portman was starring in it.
What I soon saw was a harmonious blend of love, sadness, hardship, and
every
human emotion I can even imagine.  The only thing that eclipses the intense
emotions you feel in this movie are the performances turned out by a
perfectly assembled group of some of the finest actors out there.  Natalie
Portman, Ashley Judd, Stockard Channing, Joan Cusack, just to name a few.
The only thing that should be keeping you from seeing this movie is...well,
I can't even think of an excuse that should be keeping you from seeing this
heart-warming and enchanting story.  This movie has changed my life, as I
am
sure it will any others who are fortunate enough to view
it.",2000
9,"Where the Heart Is is definitely one of the sadder movies I've seen and it's also one of the more ""true to life stories"". Emotionally effective teen girls, teen pregnancy, lost hope, and lack of parental support is sadly a part of today's society and this movie shows life isn't A-OK all the time. There are downsides, upsides, and even a zig-zagging path that comes along in life. This movie shows that something good can lead to something bad in a heartbeat, and while tragic, the movie sometimes eases up, but you can tell simultaneously really wants to have a good story and scenes that stay true to life's unpredictable set up.",2010
8,"I've never heard about this movie before, it was running on TV so I decided to watch it. I was really pleasantly surprised.",2011
7,"Well, among all the young actresses in Hollywood, Natalie really leads the pack, ahead of Angelina, Jessica. She has really this fragility and kindness that I crave. That's why the first half-hour of this movie is absolutely extraordinary: a pregnant young mother on her own in a supermarket has the stuff of the best fairy tale: With only a few words and a lot of expressions, Natalie told us her feelings in that hard time for her. This beginning has the same zen spirit as the future ""Terminal"" and it gave me the opportunity of having a glimpse of one of my dreams: i have always dreamed about getting stuck in a big supermarket and experience it all alone at night! ",2011
6,"For the first 1:15 or so, I was really enjoying this sweet and funny movie about a young girl (Novalee, played by Natalie Portman) dealing with being pregnant and unmarried, who is abandoned by her boyfriend (Dylan Bruno) and takes up residence (unknown to anyone) in a local Wal-Mart. After giving birth to the baby in the store, she is swindled and abandoned by her mother (Sally Field) but survives and flourishes thanks to the kindness of some rather eccentric strangers.",2001
7,"This film was a pleasant surprise. I know nothing about the author or the book, but the story is ""cute"" and it's told in a nice way. I'm sure there are many episodes that are great in the book but during the adaptation got a little messy (Ex. the guy and the train, the tornado, etc.)... Those parts could have been shot with more accuracy and another tone. Anyway, the film goes on, IMO the performances are very good, specially those of Portman, Judd and Cusack; and the music is fine too. I would recommend it for people who are not interested in digging too deep into the characters, but watching a nice melodrama with some sweet humorist brushes.",2007
8,"I read this book back when Oprah had her book club. The movie is not entirely faithful to the book, but it was still enjoyable!",2007
9,"Where The Heart Is has to be one of the sweetest films of all time it's a nice gem I bought a copy on DVD a few months ago and enjoyed it a lot. Natalie Portman's performance as a teen mother turned strong successful woman was brilliant and incredible. Supporting cast Stockard Channing , Ashley Judd, James Frain,and Joan Cusack also delivered top notch performances in this tale of friendship and love.",2006
10,"Just got back from seeing this wonderful film and I must say that it is great. It has some really intelligent and witty writing that touches the heart where it counts. I suggest that everyone see this, even the guys. I am a guy and I loved it. (Note: There was only 3 other guys in the packed house.)",2000
1,"My wife apologized profusely for insisting that we watch this. It was not a hard sell - we are both fans of Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd (perhaps me more so). I am no fan of Stockard Channing or Joan Cusack, but with two Oscar-nominated supporting actresses alongside Natalie and Ashley, I figured this really had to be all right. Right?",2000
10,This movie was the sweetest movie I have ever seen and it is full of drama and comedy. I love the movies that leave you feeling good. I would recommend this movie to anyone at anytime. The main character is full of sweetness and relies on the kindness of strangers to help her and her baby. Her own family doesn't even help her and it goes to show that sometimes you have to depend on the kindness of strangers and that there are good people out there willing to lend a helping hand. She goes through happy times and sad times and even decides to give up someone she loves because she feels that is what will make him the happiest. This is a must see movie!,2005
2,"To be honest, I was genuinely surprised to see this film rated much higher than about 5/10 or 5.5/10.  The high rating was undoubtedly due to emotional and seldom-used themes explored in Where the Heart Is, but this cannot disguise the movie's incredible lack of continuity and poor acting.",2000
3,"This is my wife's favorite movie and it almost makes me physically ill to watch this celebration of victimhood. The ""heroine"" is a perfect example of a taker. She is oblivious to the wants and needs of those around her, while taking advantage of them for her own benefit. Her only positive quality seems to be that she is cute. You never see her giving of herself, either to those who have given to her or to those she meets who are in less fortunate circumstances. I know that some viewers will think that I'm being harsh, but if you feel this way, then I suggest that you rewatch the movie and make a note of each time she does a selfless thing or tries to pay someone back for what she has received from them. She basically wanders through the film in an airheaded daze...""Oh, was that guy doing all those things and taking care of my baby because he liked me? OK, I'll give him a mercy-f*** and then dump him. Oh, am I in trouble because I was screwing around with cute but irresponsible hunks? Yeah, think I'll start up the same thing with the guy I ran into at the service station."" Very morally twisted.",2006
1,Why on earth would she not just call her friends after being stranded??,2005
8,"Maybe it was because I had a hard week at work.  Maybe it was because I just needed something to make me feel good.  I don't know.  I can't pinpoint it, but for some reason I really liked this movie.  Sure it was manipulative, and sure it tried it's best to make you feel all mushy inside, but you know what...I guess I was just in the mood for that, and this movie hit the spot last Friday night.  From a cinematography stand point the movie is beautiful.  Redford is known for this trait, and indeed has directed some of the most beautiful movies ever made (A River Runs Through It, The Milagro Beanfield War, The Horse Whisperer).  He just chooses some very beautiful scenery and runs with it.  However, besides the scenery, the movie seemed to flow like a steady river.  The acting was superb (even Smith's subdued Bagger), and the story was interesting.  I like golf, so maybe that helped, but I do think that anyone can enjoy this movie.  You just have to let yourself like it.",2000
7,"The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies, by their very definition, tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. Football or Ice hockey movies for instance tend to be loud, bombastic and flashy, just like the games themselves. Basketball movies meanwhile often rely on the street/hip hop connection and are just as loud, but with a slightly more gritty edge to them, provided you completely forget about the atrocious Space Jam. Bagger Vance on the other hand revolves entirely around golf and consequently, is a lot quieter, slower paced and gentle than its brash genre cousins, but it nevertheless possesses a charm and subtlety that is quite endearing.",2007
10,"I usually like fantasy movies and I really enjoy sports films. Combine the two well - like ""Field Of Dreams"" and like this movie - and I am sure to rate this extremely high. I've seen it three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.",2006
9,"I guess I'm really into the ""winning through adversity"" films.  I really enjoyed films such as ""The Natural"" and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance.""  I think the two were about equal.  They both show the hero overcoming adversity through a sport's golden age which is what makes this movie great. If you showed a golf or baseball movie today it would not be as believable because they no longer play for the love of the game but for the money. This was set in a time when the game was more dignified.  I never though much of Will Smith, thinking of him mostly as a comedy type actor but I think his greatness hit its peak when he started doing these drama type productions.  Smith is sensational in his roll.  If Redford had a mental picture of Bagger Vance before this movie started, I think he actually saw how Will Smith performed in this film.  Matt Damon was good also. ",2002
10,Hats off to Robert Redford.,2011
10,"You know, there's basically only two ways you can watch movies. You either use them as food for the thinking mind, or you simply sit back and see where it takes you, as if it's the first thing you've ever seen.",2011
8,"I used to love this film a lot, but with time I have grown less fond of it. Still I regard it as a pretty good film, for a number of reasons.",2004
5,"This adaptation of the book is well done in many ways. The casting of the supporting actors, who play Jones & Hagen, as well as the young Hardy, is top notch.",2001
10,"Every so often I have to put this film on to get a fix. I do that with films that have an undefinable something which gets under your skin. I'm not a baseball fan but I do the same thing with ""The Natural."" So why am I hooked on this picture? It's certainly not golf. I like the idea of it but I don't play it. I'm not into Zen, or partial to ""angel"" movies. Yet all of these ingredients are thrown into the hopper and worked over, by what I've come to realize is a brilliant director, and out comes a masterfully told story. I re-watch the movie, not sure what birdies or eagles are, just to daydream that if I followed Bagger's advice I too good be a great player. I watch it for Michael Ballhous's poetic cinematography. Or for the great 30's costumes draped on a ravishing Charlize Theron. Or for the fantastic performances from Charlize, Matt Damon, Will Smith especially the boy explaining why he loves the game so much. Then when I think I'm cured, I have to watch it again for Rachel Portman's incredible score which cements the other-worldliness of this story so beautifully. I guess if I looked hard I could find flaws, but I don't want to. Sometimes it's better not to analyze things that seem in perfect balance without disturbing that balance. I guess time will cure me. I hope it's not too soon.",2005
9,"I never thought much of Robert Redford as an actor --he's fun as an actor, and he plays Redford well, and that's about it-- but he is one of our most brilliant and artistic directors. Like all of Redford's films, this one is visually beautiful. Like some of Redford's best films this one is also about life and death --old age and/or the coming of death are part of the resolutions of ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" and ""A River Runs Through It. This is an unabashedly emotional and sentimental film, and that's great. No one does that better than Redford, without being Hollywoodish --mawkish and maudlin-- about it.",2002
10,"To start off, I have NEVER written a review before. This movie, however, was honestly SO much more than I expected I could not help but write one -- and I truly believe this is a movie everyone should see. This movie is inspiring and speaks millions to overcoming the adversities of life. Just as golf is a game, so is life -- to some extent -- and cannot be won, but merely played.",2014
7,"This is a movie I very much like, and last evening as I was watching it for maybe the 4th time I tried to focus on why it wasn't more popular. I think what it comes down to is that there's an awfully lot of time in the movie spent on the course...so if you're not a golfer or not ""into"" golf, that might bore you. And I tried to compare that in my mind with films about other sports, and it seems to me there is much more time spent on the links here, than might be spent on the diamond for most baseball films or on the field for most football films.",2013
10,"This movie is the best of the best. Many will disagree but for me, its my favorite movie of all time behind the dark knight and the lord of the rings trilogy. This movie grasps the essence of film making as an art form. In other words, great and beautiful cinematography. ",2012
5,"There were great philosophical and spiritual thoughts and meanings in the book. The Bagger Vance character in the book was a Christ-Like/Buddha figure, helping Junuh overcome the obstacles in his life. The movie turned the story into Chevy Chase saying ""Be the Ball"" in Caddyshack. I love golf, I thought this movie was a bore.",2001
8,"I've seen and own both this version and the original movie version. I have to say there are things I like better about each movie. The mini-series version has much more time in which to tell this very complicated story. However, the writers seem to have felt the need to invent story lines that do not exist in the Frank Herbert books (i.e. Irulan's affair with Feyd). I did enjoy that Irulan had more of a presence in this movie, and I prefer the overall look of this film (the ruddiness reminding more of an arid desert than the cold greyishness of the original movie). I much prefer the miniseries interpretation of what the 'Weirding Way' is, showing it as a technique rather than a device. However, I miss the 'though-overs' from the original movie, and I thought Sting played a much better Feyd. A true Dune fan will need to see both movies...",2004

2,"This movie is an attempt to fit a saga such as Frank Herbert's into $20M and this sad fact is apparent in every CGI sequence, in every landscape, in every interior and costume. The book is such a great material for a superb movie.  Unfortunately, Dune 2000 is anything but that.",2001

10,"If there was one word to describe this version of ""Dune,"" I would have to say extraordinary.  John Harrison has done a fantastic job at writing and directing this fantastic miniseries.  Graham Revell's score, dazzling visual effects, flawless cinematography, well-developed story, and the cast all essentially contributed to masterful epic storytelling.  However, ""Frank Herbert's 'Dune'"" does suffer from the stiff performance of William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides.  On the other hand, the performances by Ian McNeice and Alec Newman makes this entertaining.  Overall, ""Frank Herbert's 'Dune'"" is impressive, spellbinding, and exciting.  It's a must see for any science fiction fan or anyone who loves a great story!!",2000
1,"If you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini-series is based on, it may actually be good. Unfortunately, if you ARE a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. All of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film, the most important scenes from the book have been taken out, characters motivations have been changed completely, and words from the wrong characters mouths. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked, in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.",2003
6,"While this version expands the story, which was OK in itself, the charisma of the performances just was not there. I enjoy William Hurt as a rule, but in this case his performance as Duke Leto ""hurt"". Alec Newman's Paul was overly whiny. Saska Reeves was too young as Jessica and then did not even play the role in the sequel, causing a jarring break in consistency. Admittedly some of the costumes were more entertaining in this version, but the still suits of the Fremen were totally unbelievable. One could not conceive of anyone lasting very long in them sitting by a lake much less in the middle of the desert. In the long run the original 1984 theatrical version is the better bet. Plus it had the blessing of the author as well.",2007
6,"The problem with adapting books to the movie screen, especially huge epics like Dune, is that a certain interpretation of the original is necessary. Making a 2-3 hour movie out of this novel simply requires a lot of interpretation along with picking and choosing of the source material.  So, I know a lot of people who read the book Dune and really hated the movie adaptation for all the same predictable reasons -- ""Why did they change that?"", ""How could they leave that part out?"", and ""Where did they come up with that?"".",2001

1,"What can I say? After having read Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they appeared to ""big stalagtites"" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate. I won't even start about the disgraceful ""Navigator"" effect.",2001

The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: The acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and looked cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the CGI visual effects childish.",2001

2,"I thought this movie was terrible. In comparison to the 1984 version of this film (which I love) I was extremely disappointed. My friends and I are huge Dune fans, and we anticipated this movie like there was no tomorrow. I mean, who better to make a science fiction flick like Dune than the SciFi channel? Right? WRONG !! I felt the acting was completely wooden, like people read their lines without trying to emphasize the context. They also went to great lengths to pronounce words differently than the David Lynch movie (like saying Chainey instead of Chani). The special effects in this film looked like they were out of a Playstation one video game (not a Capcom game either, but some small cheesy development company). They did include much more of the book in this one, but I'll take quality over quantity any day. I was unable to identify or form an attachment to any of the characters in this film. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible time.",2005
2,"I completely agree with other comments ... the production, sets, camerawork, acting, script, and yes, even the score, are just flimsy cardboard pasted to emulate ""art"".  The only thing I might add is just how non-suspenseful the whole thing is.  From the pain-box all the way through the water of life, at no time do we feel like anyone will die for their actions ... it's all so bland, and only designed to fill us up with 6 hours of commercials, interspersed with some movie stuff.  Sometimes, I almost expect a Pepsi can to come jumping out & attack Paul, just to make things more interesting.",2000
1,"This miniseries/movie was so terrible at times that I nearly broke down and turned it off. I am a great fan of the novel, however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems. The costuming is poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase. The departures from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are missed or rewritten.",2001

""Children of Dune"" was released in Brazil in three DVDs, and I have just watched the first one - ""Children of Dune – The Empire of Harkonnen"". I did not like this first part, since the story is very confused and has elements of soap-opera. The cinematography, the visual and sound effects are great, but there are too many characters without previous development, and betrayals, plots and subplots for a 93 minutes running time, and in the end I was completely lost of who is who in the story. My vote is five.",2016

That and telemarketing did the rest.",2010

In Boiler Room he shows that he is more than muscle as he acts his pants off!  If you like Wall Street, you will love this - there is even a tribute to it in the movie.

I know the basics and that could get me by until I asked people that were much more well versed and graceful when it comes to that side of business.  I do know however that the stock market can be sleazy and deceitful at times and it can also be cut-throat economics.  With this in mind I went into this picture with high hopes of at least a film that would teach me something about a part of life that I knew very little about.  I was also intrigued because Ben Affleck looked like he had the Alec Baldwin role from Glen Gary Glen Ross, that small but explosive role where the seasoned vet comes in and tells eveyone how to sell, when to sell and what the best way to screw people out of their money is..... and hey, what do you know, I was right. Ben Affleck does have a similar role to Baldwin's.   But what I wasn't expecting was the film that was before me.  Boiler Room is one hell of a film and even if you know very little about stocks and bonds and insider trading and what-not, there is still plenty in here to keep you intrigued.",2000
9,"The large and well-selected cast turned in very powerful performances. They crafted a convincing range of emotions, from cunning cut-throat manipulators of their clients' personal wealth during office hours, to brief examples of their ""boys will be boys"" shenanigans after hours. The story line is built completely around their personal financial greed, the hapless victims they scammed to realize it (with the greatest focus on one of them), and a well-sustained sense of mystery that plants seeds of possibilities along the way. The ending was not at all predictable; it could have gone in any of several directions. The viewer gets the impression that if these predators could yank even the last remaining penny out of a client on his (they targeted males) deathbed, they'd gleefully do so and view it as a major coup giving them full bragging rights. There's a hint of information about how legitimate stockbrokers earn their credentials and that was enlightening. The romantic angles are minimalized and that serves to benefit the film. The language is consistently coarse, but certainly seemed realistic for the characters' ages, their business sector and their work ethic. For everyone who enjoyed ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" ""Wall Street"" (both of which are alluded to in the film), or even more appropriately ""The Crooked E: The Unshredded Truth About Enron,"" this feature will really score a bulls-eye.",2006

Because it seemed more real to me (the script and acting probably did it) than the other films.  I liked the Giovanni Ribisi character, who changes slightly through the film, but eventually we see the real side of him, which is great.  Funny, thrilling and cool, this film may not be for the weak at heart, but it is for anyone who can afford the tickets.

It's a niche movie for 18-30 year old men who are frustrated with the grind, and would prefer an easier, quicker way to riches. ""Boiler Room"" also has some of the pent up male aggression that was astutely highlighted in ""Fight Club."" ",2009
7,"Boiler Room is basically about a young college drop-out, played by Giovanni Ribisi, who is seeking the quick way to the top. He starts an illegal gambling casino in his home, but is soon offered a job as a stock broker. This is a fast-paced occupation full of young guys who don't know what to do with their money. They gamble constantly, they party constantly; drugs, women and cars. On the surface, this is easily brushed off as a formulaic, pop-culture movie. If you pay attention though, this is a lot more than that. The subtext for this story is the relationship Ribisi has with his father. This relationship holds a lot of tension, and through the film goes through many changes both positive and negative, and culminates in a tear-jerking revelation. I'll admit it, I almost cried. But there is also a lot more going on here, most notably the story of one of Ribisi's clients who had domestic problems he had to face with his wife and children. His performance was impressive, and you really felt for him.",2006

In the movie made 13 years after the the great 1987 stock market crash with dozens of market bigwigs thrown behind bars for manipulating the market and fleecing investors of billions they, a new generation of crooked stock boys, are back again in action doing their thing. This time in a sleazy chop shop brokerage house 100 miles west of Wall Street in Commack NY called J.T Marlin. Told by the brokerage house's chief as well as senior member the 27 year old Jim Young, Ben Affleck, that anyone who's lucky enough to get a job at J.T Martin will end up being a millionaire,like himself, in just three short years.

9,"Well this is an easy one for me. i watched this 4 years ago. The writing in this movie is an 8 out of 10. Its a more than solid idea for a movie with a nicely adapted story. What put this movie over the top for me was the acting. I usually can't stand Vin Diesel or Ben Affleck, but this movie makes me think there's hope for them yet. Affleck sells it with the cocky, over the top character, and diesel plays a similar character with a conscience. The actor that steals the show however, is Giovanni Ribisi. He plays a character who is a slacker,but a guy who is clearly smart and knows how to make money for himself. When all is lost and you feel he is a one dimensional heartless character like the rest (minus Diesel), he does everything in his power to get Harry Reynard, a hard working family man, his money back that he had lost in the scam that was JT Marlin. As i said before, the writing in the movie gets a, 8 out of 10, and the acting gets a 9 out of 10. Props to Ben Younger, Giovanni Ribisi and a surprisingly good performance by Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck. Notable supporting roles to Scott Caan, Tom Everett Scott and Ron Rifkin. Excellent movie.",2012
10,"Ben Youngers modern day Wall Street story about a young stock broker, Seth Davis (Ribisi) who learns about fraud companies the hard way. THe film is well-directed, and although not completely realistic and at times a bit exaggerated, its extremely effective. Its very well written, has some hilarious lines and is entertaining through out. The cast was fresh, i like all the performances here, any film that leaves me thinking Diesel and Affleck were not annoying and actually convincing has done miracles just in that on its own. Ribisi is great in the lead and Scott Caan was my favorite supporting performance although Ron Rifkin and Tom Everett Scott were great too. I like Youngers screenplay a lot and his direction wasn't bad either. Boiler Room is a bit overlooked if you ask me, its an instant favorite of mine, seen it a couple times over the years, glad to have finally reviewed it. 10/10",2006

It's funny that they highlighted two good movies in this film, Glengarry Glenross, and Wall Street. If you're thinking of watching a good movie about sales, choose Glengarry Glenross, and if you have a yen for something about stocks and takeovers, choose Wall Street.  Whatever you do, don't waste your precious time with this misguided, inane piece of cinematic garbage.",2001
1,"I watched this movie last night on USA and it is one of the least coherent movies I've ever seen. There are all these useless details that are never explained and cause confusion to the viewer. Whose house are they at and why is there no furniture? How can your boss give you advice on not spending your money frivolously while driving 80 miles per hour in a Lamborghini? Will Giovanni Ribisi ever get any sleep? The movie is based on a decent premise, but leaps out of bounds because of the acting and direction. The acting is awful. The characters are unbelievable. And the direction is...well, was there a director? The movie slaps around for awhile not making any sense then tries to bring it all together at the end. This is ineffective.",2006
8,"Everything you feared might be true about the macho culture of Wall Street is duly confirmed by this gripping thriller; although in fact, the story is set in a small firm not actually on Wall Street, but operating in Long Island. Which is perhaps part of the reason this film is good rather than great. In telling the story of an obvious bad apple, it shies from the business of dredging the barrel: no opinion is offered as to whether the big finance houses are up to the same tricks, but only with more finesse. Still, the movie is compulsively watchable, although the ending is slightly anticlimactic and the plot a little stretched. And given the essential unlikeability of its characters, even the nominally sympathetic ones, that's a fair achievement.",2006

It shows how Monica and Q have grown through the ""quarters""in the movie.. This movie reminds me a lot of my first love, when we broke up I still loved him just as Monica did with Q.. My favorite part of this movie is when everything is going great with them and they are in college and their life just seems perfect. My least favorite part is when they are going through their crossroads because i hate to see people that are so in love break up. this is my favorite movie and i would recommend it to anyone!!!",2005

Just a cookie cutout of a movie, you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie adds nothing new.  The dialogue is never funny, interesting, or intelligent.  The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker.  Nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is LONG gives it an easy thumbs down.  Sorry, fans.",2001
10,"I am definitely more of a movie fan than a basketball fan, thus I went in expecting a jock flick with a token relationship thrown in to justify the title. I could not have been more wrong. Unlike ""He Got Game"" (another very good film), which dwells solely on the negative aspects of the sport - hustlers, hookers, drugs and death, L&B concentrates on the positive things in life and basketball serves as the background rather than the focus. The story is very well written and works on several levels - it refuses to be pinned down as simply a romance or drama, choosing instead a careful blending of different elements. My only complaint - minor at that - would have to be the ending (and no I'm not going to tell you).",2017

Throughout the film, you feel the reality and intensity as a viewer. Although this film does not fit the usual fast-paced action, excitement, and adventure stereotype of this analytical approach, it can still be used because you can feel the intensity of Monica and Quincy's love throughout the whole movie. The diegesis of the film seems like a reality, and makes you forget that you're watching a film.",2011
10,"This movie is one of my favorite films. It came out in the year of 2000. I gave this movie a 10 because i like this film,it shows the passion that both Q and Monica has for basketball. To me, its cute. I just love the way they grew up together and in the end how they had a baby. This movie shows many things. It shows passion, love and determination for what they want. The first time i watched this movie i wasn't really paying attention. I had to watched this movie over and over again to grip the concept or the moral of this love story. I honestly loved how they both acted in this movie. I love the determination. To me its crazy because they didn't only focus on basketball, but they focused on other things in life other than themselves or each other. I also enjoyed this film because its some what realistic. Im pretty sure many people out there in the world love this movie for all the right reason. I must say that i had to give a standing ovation to the director/writer. I so love this movie, Its awesome!",2009
9,"Love and Basketball has been one of my favorite movies since it was released in 2000. The soundtrack to it was awesome! It was effective and appropriate. The songs fit the movie perfectly and actually complimented it. Since the movie was told through the 80's and 90's the music fit the time appropriately. It wasn't music from the 70's or the 50's but music that was within the time line. However, Al Green's LOVE AND HAPPINESS which open the beginning scene was a nice touch even though it wasn't directly from the given time period.",2009

The beginning of the movie was interesting having those little kids competing over a basketball game, i noticed it will be a love story when they grow up, but it is a really rich movie offering the sport, romance, social flavors which are my favorite flavors. I really loved the purity of Sanaa Lathan, she was incredible & also Omar Epps was great too. They were in complete harmony. The movie is about true love that stays forever & also about achieving your life goals & having someone beside you supporting you to never give up. Hope to see such couples in real life!!",2007
9,"I don't know why everybody rips this movie. The special effects are very realistic, down to the pink-tinted Martian sky. The plot is plausible (for science fiction), paying attention to many small details that often make these kinds of movies farcical. Most important, it's very existential; humans simply trying to survive against almost insurmountable odds. As the struggle builds, the relationships begin to gel nicely. This IS a movie about human relationships, not Star Wars style hype. I know, there are some weak spots. The opening and closing dialog, Val Kilmer whispering all the way through, some of the dialog, etc. But overall, this movie doesn't try to do too much (unlike the abysmal Mission To Mars), and that's what makes it a success.",2005

It's much better than the hokey De Palma movie. There are a lot of weaknesses in it but even with all it's faults, the whole package worked.",2005
10,"I honestly loved ""Red Planet."" I thought that Kilmer did a great job playing the ""rebellious yet skilled"" character that he was so deft at in the 80's. I also felt that Moss added another good performance that was similar to her ""soldier yet woman"" role from ""Matrix."" The thought of not only oxygen but LIFE on Mars had not really been touched yet but it worked out greatly..think about it: the actors can actually do their thing without having to wear a bulky space suit the whole time...it adds a lot of fast moving action and real drama to the movie. I also love Sizemore's performances. I guess if you like the actors and are open to a new kind of sci-fi/action plot, you at least should give this movie a shot. I loved it!",2002

Although this film is much better than the (oddly) bigger box-office hit Mission to Mars it still lacks a lot. OK Carrie Ann Moss and Tom Sizemore are good in their roles, but the plot is just too predictable at times. The biggest compliment though goes out to Val Kilmer who on his own earned one of the points I give this film.",2001

This movie could have been a bad made-for-tv movie or a bad episode of Stargate - but the idea of thinking people should pay for this?!?!?",2000
1,Right from the the getgo this movie was & turned to worse. Tom Sizemore & Simon Baker could not act if their lives depended on it. The director should be embarrassed. not worth hiring. I bet the producer never got a good return on their money. I think Val Kilmar & Kerrie anne Moss lowered them selves on this 1,2017
4,I honestly haven't got a lot of good things to say about Red Planet other than it tried. It really tried. This wasn't meant to be a movie that makes you fall asleep instead of afraid and thrilled and to that end I feel like I must go easier on it. The people behind the effects deserve praise and really push this movie up in quality. it's just a shame that it is undercut by lazy directing and bland as unbuttered white bread acting with Val Kilmer putting in a lazy performance to rival his batman performance a few years earlier. ,2016

Having watched both Mission to Mars and Red Planet back to back thanks to the SciFi channel M2M is not as good as Red Planet. Having watched M2M 3 times now, I would recommend RP 1st. It is a nice twist of the 1950s B grade sci-fi movies.",2005
7,"Director Antony Hoffman's ""Red Planet"" is an old-fashioned sci-fi action picture with some modern twists. The gum-chewing, wise-cracking mechanic, who would have been a quickly-killed-off supporting character in a 1950s movie, is now the lead. He is solidly played by the quirky Val Kilmer.  The tough-as-nails, damn-my-orders-I'll-save-my-crew captain is a woman-Carrie-Anne Moss from ""The Matrix.""   The gray-haired old scientist-an underused Terence Stamp-has turned to philosophy and religion, where in the old days he would have been a hard-headed skeptic (that role is left to biologist Tom Sizemore). 	The premise is that, by the year 2057, Earth is so badly polluted that we are seeding the sands of Mars with algae to produce oxygen so that humans can colonize the red planet (don't algae need water to live?)-but the algae have suddenly vanished from our telescopes.  So Commander Bowman and her crew are sent to investigate.  While she orbits in a crippled spaceship, the five men (including pilot Benjamin Bratt and Simon Baker-the obligatory Guy From Brooklyn) land on Mars in a suspenseful crash scene. 	I won't give away what they find, but I will say the solution to the mystery is more like something out of a good science fiction novel than a Hollywood sci-fi movie.  There is life on Mars, but it's not a typical movie monster.  But there is the expedition's robot, AMEE, which is damaged in the crash landing, reverts to its original military programming, and starts stalking the men like a rogue lion.  This leads to scenes reminiscent of another Val Kilmer film, the underrated ""The Ghost and the Darkness."" 	The premise may be far-fetched, but I thought the execution and resolution of ""Red Planet"" were exciting and  satisfying.  (And yes, guys, Carrie-Anne does get one brief, gratuitous shower scene.)  I haven't seen ""Mission to Mars,"" so I can honestly say that this is the best Mars movie I've seen this year.",2001
7,"RED PLANET is decent science fiction in a year that brought us some relatively weak competition in the genre. Outstanding special effects, a competent cast, great sound, and an artistic eye for set design are the film's strong points. After what seems like a long drought, it's nice to see the sleek Carrie-Anne Moss back on the screen. Serious, pragmatic, and physically fit, she is a natural choice for a mission commander. Some might argue that she and the other characters are somewhat wooden, but I would counter that coolness is a requisite trait in those individuals who are selected to fly such a mission. The director had to choose between verisimilitude and dramatic impact, and I applaud his riskier choice of the former.",2000
8,"Recap: Earth is dying. Mankind's hope stands to Mars. Unmanned probes has sent a type of algae to the red planet in hopes of rising the oxygen level.

But as the team approaches the planet, they experience a solar proton event, and the mothership sustains heavy damage. Most of the crew try to evacuate with the landing vehicle, but crashes. The senior member of the team is fatally injured. With limited air supply they head for the pre-built habitat. They arrive, and finds it in ruins. Soon out of air, all hope seem lost. But there are good news and bad news. The good news is that the atmosphere is mysteriously breathable. The bad news is that the team's robot AMEE (on loan from the marines) suffered damage in the landing too, and turned to military mode. And she thinks the ground team is the enemy.",2005

2,"I've had a real dilemma since seeing Red Planet.  For this year, which was the worse movie, Red Planet or Mission to Mars?  It's a tough call.  I gave both a 2, feeling the sometimes fun special effects saved each from being ""Plan 9"" level.  But, these are both truly awful science-fiction films. What is so amazing is how both turned out to be just about the same film. Both are based on the ""big accident when we get there"" plot line. At least Red Planet avoided the ""Faces on Mars"" nonsense of Mission to Mars.  But, the idea that we can have massive terraforming efforts going on on Mars including a built habitat without noticing lots of life forms, dramatically increased oxygen levels, and everything else this movie just pops out of the woodwork is so moronic as to be just about ""Plan 9"" level.  As if that wasn't enough, we throw in the ""killer robot""/""military hardware run amok"" standard plot line #17 just for good measure.",2001
7,"Thirty years is a long time to wait to make a sequel, especially when no one is clamoring for one.  Director/Writer/Producer John Singleton decided it was about time.  The result is a solid, but undistinguished crime drama. The elements of this story have been told so many times that they are becoming hackneyed.  A tough, no-nonsense cop fights evil and corruption to bring justice to the streets while often disregarding the law.  A spoiled rich kid is trying to get away with murder by hiring a drug dealer to snuff an eyewitness with the help of a couple of dirty cops.  This is not vanguard material.",2001
8,"I went to see this movie expecting to see a big-budget remake of the original Shaft, and I got it.",2000
7,"This review is written as a defence of John Singleton's 'homage' to the 2000 edition of Shaft. The majority of people that I know (6 in all) use similar terms when referring to it: average, mediocre, I-hate-Busta-Rhymes etcetera. However, it actually isn't average or mediocre at all (although Busta Rhymes is indeed a complete tool.) Sure, the story is linear, predictable and doesn't bring anything new to a tired genre (Racial injustice! Rogue cops! Black attitude!) but one has to see past that to the performances, because that's where the real gold lies. Well, three performances to be precise. First, Samuel L. Jackson. Though his roles may lack a certain amount of vicissitude, they are always entertaining. And he seems to restrain himself as the ""sex machine to all the chicks."" He doesn't actually have sex at all throughout the film, which I see as a good thing. As Shaft, he receives most of the animated and colourful dialogue, kills the most bad guys technically murder seeing as he resigns from the police force at the beginning), and gets to wear nine different varieties of the same jacket, all the while looking effortlessly cool. Plus he throws a police badge into a wall... really fast! Second, Christian Bale. It is no secret that Bale is now objectively the best actor of his generation, but come the dawn of the new millennium he had yet to present himself to a wider audience. Unfortunately, Shaft failed to do so too. However, is performance is superb. Following on from his equivocal turn as Norman Bates in American Psycho (2000), Bale continues his villainous streak as Walter Wade, Jr, a truly horrible character whose racial attack in a restaurant provides the basis for the story. Really the only word that can describe Wade is ""a$$hole"" and Bale plays this role perfectly. It is rare that one could despise a character this much and that is what makes him so fun to watch.",2008
4,"An enjoyable but nevertheless quite silly and average remake of the classic television show has the new John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) beating up a white racist (Christian Bale) and getting booted off of the police force. Everyone in this film is a racist - primarily the whites - and this whole idea is way too forced. The language and violence is rough, yet the film itself is quite goofy, with not many good scenes and only a few mediocre action sequences. The moral is somewhat depressing: if someone wrongs you, or someone of your race, then beat them up and kill them once they reappear. Richard Roundtree's cameo helps a bit, but regardless, this SHAFT is still only ""good"" at best.",2004
7,Shaft (2000),2013
6,"""Shaft 2000"" is a reasonable successor to the original Shaft of 29 years ago. The film shows restraint by keeping Shaft big, but not bigger than life, as it tries to be a human story first and an action flick second. Unfortunately, in spite of good performances (especially by Wright) and good production talent, the story fails on the human level and hedges on the obvious alternative of exaggerated good and bad guys and a profusion of gratuitous violence, sex, and action. Worth a watch but keep expectations low.",2000
1,"While the trailers and commercials for this movie made it look really good, this movie itself is a POS that is openly racist against white people and the plot itself is nothing more than African American revenge. Samuel L. Jackson's worst role ever. ",2006
8,"I was surprised that I liked this remake of ""Shaft"" as much as I did. It has a wonderful ensemble cast, which included Toni Collette, Christian Bale, and the terrific, Jeffrey Wright. All of them are allowed to bring their considerable acting chops to their roles, especially Bale as a Hateful Rich White Boy from central casting, and Wright as a simultaneously hilarious and scary gangster. Samuel L. Jackson plays, well, Samuel L. Jackson, this time cast as Shaft, a tall, tough, elegant black dude who looks like Samuel L. Jackson  not that there's anything wrong with that.",2008
7,"I love this 1980s-style action flick, and watch it every time it is pops up on TV. Sam Jackson plays Shaft's nephew, a big-city cop trying to track down a reluctant witness to a racially motivated murder. The killer, played by a sinister, pre-BATMAN Christian Bale, is modeled on the New York preppie rapist (remember him?). He hires a low-level drug dealer (Jeffrey Wright) to track down the witness, a waitress (Toni Collette), and kill her. Shaft must find her before they do. Jackson is silky smooth, the action is right out of a DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON flick, and the landscape is populated by some great supporting players including Dan Hedaya as a corrupt cop and Vanessa Williams as a cop who has Shaft's back. The original Shaft, Richard Roundtree, even pops up a couple of times. This is one wild and funny ride that plays the way we prefer our action films to play. At times, it is a little thin on plot, but it keeps moving. No blood to speak of, just action, action and more action. And keep a close eye on Wright, a noted stage and screen actor. His soft-spoken drug lord tenderly holds a newborn baby at one moment and in the next pokes a knife into the neck of a terrified woman. He steals every scene he is in.",2010
5,"""a low down dirty shame"" - that's the name of the movie this movie was based on, originally directed & starring Keenan Wayans (1994). But that film is as much comedy as action film.

1,"What have you done, John Singleton? You went from ""Boyz N the Hood"" (one of the best movies EVER made by a freshman director) and ""Higher Learning"" (flawed, but still a good film at the end of the day) to a movie that was unnecessary, excessive, and profoundly stupid. You quarreled with your star (Samuel L. Jackson) and botched the character development of 2 of the best actors in films, in Jeffrey Wright and Christian Bale. Unoriginal to the Nth degree, this is a terrible remake, and is a time waster. If you want the real deal, stick to the Richard Roundtree original. Vanessa L. Williams, Dan Hedaya, Toni Collette, Mekhi Phifer, Busta Rhymes, and Lee Tergesen all show up for this dud, and my one hope is that they were paid well for appearing in this steaming pile of !@%%^^$#@!",2005
3,"For me, the old bad-attitude-cop-turned-investigator routine is getting boring.  Shaft is just this, it doesn't provide any new twists to an old character.  The movie could be good for TV not for theaters.  However, it was entertaining.",2001
8,"Singleton's homage and modern day Shaft is an entertaining movie. Its not perfect, definitely flawed, from Wright's hilarious performances as People Hernandez, to the lines Samuel L. Jackson uses, to the whole feel of it, at times it did feel like a long sitcom. However it is always entertaining and exciting, and thats more than i can say for some other movies. I thought the cast did well, and basically saved Singleton, as the film seemed put together kind of lazy and rode the reputations of those involved. Still, it was a good movie, and i think its worth a look. Jeffrey Wright has some hilarious lines like ""this is Italian leather, worth more than half your shitty paycheck"" to the cops. hahaIMDb Rating: 5.9- MY Rating: 8/10",2008
4,"Entertaining, I guess. Samuel L Jackson is naturally urbane. Richard Roundtree gets a role, rather than a cameo. Christian Bale is a high-calibre baddie - Jeffrey Wright is always watchable. Just like the celebrated blaxploitation films of the 70s retribution comes through a conflict of charisma.",2007
1,"Racist cop John Shaft (again the over rated Sam Jackson) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people, well, this movie is a bit of something absurd.

I would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians.....",2004
1,"This is one terrible movie, in an attempt to make all ""white people"" as ""racists"", the cop called 'Shaft' gets upset if someone uses the wrong word to describe black negroes.  This is silly because he himself is hateful and uses violence to beat up people that don't agree with him.  The plot, or the simplistic story, deals with some white guy who is stereotyped to the extreme by the black director and the cop Shaft loses his job because some black kid he knew was killed.  It just goes down hill from there, this isn't even worth watching.",2003
1,"When i first saw commercials for Shaft I thought it looked great.  But when I saw it i was sorely mistaken.  It made me sick to my stomach that people watched it and actually enjoyed it.  I saw no attraction whatsoever. Characters you didnt care about, a stupid plot that has been done over and over and over and over.  And even Samuel L. Jackson (who is a personal favorite of mine) sucked in it.  Spouting off cheesy catch phrases in an attempt to sound like ""the man"".  Well, Shaft is not the man, and shame on anyone who thought he was.",2001
2,"Did this black director have to create a white villain whose villainy was essentially racial hatred? Couldn't he have been a little more creative than that? Would it have been possible to have at least two good white guys in the movie? Does Singleton really believe that justice in America is unavailable to people of color? This movie joins a parade of films recently that endorses anti-white, anti-establishment vigilante violence. It ain't cute and it ain't funny. In the end it sows the seeds of ongoing racial alienation and hatred. But I'll bet John Grishom loved it.",2000
1,"In this case the theme song is right on the money - Shaft is one bad - m ovie!!  This movie boils down to one thing - race.  You see everyone white) in the movie is a racist (what a surprise coming from Singleton - SO different from his other films (please!)) and Shaft is the defender of justice against it.  Mind you I am not white and thought that was quite ridiculous.  Other than that the movie is basically garbage action with weak action sequences and a thin plot line.  Not even the so called surprise ending could help the film in any way.  The only bright part of the film was of course Samuel L. Jackson, who's acting was the only thing that prevented me from walking out of the movie theater.  Other than that, Shaft should be shafted up Singleton's rear end.",2000

I told them that if one person can do something wonderful for another person, that it could pass on like a domino reaction. Everyone loved my speech and the teacher even said that we could all do one nice thing, so for that day after class we had to do something nice, hoping it would cause a reaction.

It is not only a moving story but everybody who sees this film stops for a moment or more and think over the meaning of life. One of the best American films I have ever seen with lots of good actors. Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt are wonderful. In secondary schools it should be a compulsory part of education. I am a teacher and when I want to talk about this topic I always choose this film and students find it a very good example, too. It has not got a happy ending like it often happens in life. It is not a stupid story, it gives us lots of extras. When I first watched it, at the end of the film I was full of emotions and just could not sleep for a while. To put it into a nutshell: Try it and pay attention to Pay it forward.",2005

Some that come to mind are Martin Luther King Jr, JFK, Gandhi and Terry Fox.  It's not easy to change the world.  It takes a lot of hard work and determination.  And it doesn't happen overnight.  But then you see a film like this and you begin to question that rationale.  What if a concept like this really was implemented?  What if every single person that had a favour bestowed upon them was asked to pay it forward?  Is it possible that a Utopian world could be achieved?  I doubt it, but it certainly would go a long way to making this condemned world a better place to live.",2000

The performances are excellent by all the cast members and the emotional tie you develop with the characters is so amazing that you start to feel what they are feeling and go through their good and bad times. This movie is inspiring and heart driven. I really enjoyed this movie because of the well written story and smoothly moving plot of this movie. The movie does not leave you confused as to what is going on or why. That's why I gave this movie a 10, because it is excellent. The odd thing is about movies, the ones that aren't really that good get the awards, yet the really good ones never get one. I have really never understood that. This movie should have been given an award.",2004
8,watched the movie over the weekend! And i really enjoyed the story. I haven't read the book but i think the idea deserves credit and well done on making it into a movie... greater potential to get people thinking even if it is just for 5minutes.,2007
8,"A film of surprising majesty mainly because of its sincerity to convey the tale of a young (American) high school student, touchingly and masterfully played by the then 12-year-old Haley Joel Osment, who, at the instigation of his new teacher's challenge to the class, comes up with a beautiful and simple plan to make a difference in the world, involving doing a good turn to not just one person but three, who then, in turn, return the gift themselves to three more people, thereby very quickly spreading goodness in both directions, in the giving and receiving, in the most unlikely places and ways. Warning: a tear-jerker!",2008
8,"Pay It Forward is based on a plot that makes you think almost about everything -both while watching and after. There are elements that make you smile and cry, and the cast is very good at delivering the superb scenario. Helen Hunt and Kevin Spacey surely do not disappoint and Haley Joel Osment performs perfect, giving everything one could expect from such a young actor. Jon Bon Jovi is the surprise among the cast and adds a nice flavor to an already delicious dish. From the beginning until the very end, the movie manages to touch somewhere deep in your heart, and although I did not the book it was based on, the plot makes a lot of sense in its entirety and shines with its originality. It does not come with numerous awards or an exceptionally high IMDb rating, but it really is a very good movie.",2012
8,"I watched this movie, before reading the original book and surprisingly, i found myself liking the movie better! never have i had this experience before, but i must say, that the story behind Eugene's disfigurements was more interesting than Reuben (the book character's name) who was a war veteran. I also think that although the character of Reuben/Eugene was meant to be played by a black man, Kevin Spacey was perfect for the role and you could not have chosen a better actor to play it. Helen Hunt also did very well as Arlene McKinney and really represented the character how she was meant to be, based on the book, which is a rather difficult thing to do. I think that although the film and book differed to a certain extent (as all film adaptations do), the film kept the sentimental quality of the book and in the movie Trevor doesn't get to meet the president which I find to be more realistic rather than a story book fairytale idealism. Overall, i recommend both the book and the movie.",2005
10,"""If somebody does something for you, don't pay it back, pay it forward"". This is the quote that you can find on the front case. Trevor is a 7th grader who's teacher tells the class to come up with something that can change the world and then tells them to act on it.",2013
7,"First of all, I liked this movie. I did enjoy it a lot. It pulled me in. It appealed to me for lots of reasons... but I didn't like the ending. I wish like the dickens that they'd have chosen a different one. The feeling that it left me with was wondering what anyone in that story gained by its ending that way. I'm sure there was something... some lesson, some high consciousness or something, kicking in to make the people better human beings... but I know how the viewer was expected to feel all through it and that said, they were rooting for the triumph of the main character, and it was coming along so nicely... then poof. You are left bewildered and mad.",2004

1,"Did i see the same movie that most of the other commenters saw?  This has got to be one of the worst films of the year.  Right up there with Battlefield Earth and Hollow Man.  How could a movie with Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment be this bad.  I had to go home and watch Usual Suspects and American Beauty just to be remind that Spacey has made some good films.  I like the idea of this film very much and I wanted to like it, I really did.  I wanted to feel good when I left this movie, like after watching Field of Dreams or The Shawshank Redemption.  Instead I felt empty, manipulated and stupider. Lets start with the screenplay.  What the hell is up with the screenplay?  I mean, I like the beginning where they show Spacey ironing (his routine), then the scene with Jay Mohr where he has to Pay it Forward.  I liked that because it can be viewed as a turning point in the movie.  It is from this scene that Pay it Forward gets national attention.  Scorsese used this technique in Goodfellas and Casino and it would have worked here if they didn't decide to defy the rules of space and time.  The film procedes to cut between ""4 months earlier"" when the movement first begins, and Jay Mohr trying to find out how it started.  It was distracting and unnecessary. It took away from the whole movie.  It was like the people in charge were saying ""look how clever we can be, we're telling you the story in a nonlinear way.""  They could have shown Jay Mohr and then go back 4 months, leading up to the beginning, like in Goodfellas or American Beauty even. The ending was stupid and contrived.  this movie is so frustrating.  THe characters are so one dimensional and cliched.  They say one thing and then in the next scene they are doing the opposite.  I told three people not to see this movie i hope they pay it forward and tell three people not to see it and so on and so on until no one sees this awful film.",2000

1,"Previous comments seem to focus on *the stars*, which is just the problem with this debris! It was a sweet idealistic book that became a star vehicle on screen, spayed of all social value. The book-teacher, Reuben St. Clair, is black; but you still can't have a black man kissing and marrying a white woman. And that's just the most obvious ""whitewash"". All controversy has been scrubbed from the film; there are no Black (Reuben) or Hispanic (Ricky) characters, not even any Italians (Jerry BUSCONI has no last name on screen, and Charlotte RENALDI has no name at all; she's just the woman on the bridge.) Reuben is a Vietnam vet, going against the stereotype; he's still haunted, but not a broken parasite. The film-Jerry lives down to the stereotype, using drugs and living in a dumpster. There are no gay characters in the film. There are 3 in the book; Lou Tartaglia (Reuben's friend from back east), Gordie and Sandy. The book skinheads become a schoolyard bully; drab, dusty Atascadero becomes glittering Las Vegas. There is no Sidney G. in the film, a vital link in the Movement. And the scene of the vigil outside Arlene's house is utterly unconvincing as the seed of a worldwide movement. Maybe that's the point; the book was Clinton (in fact, he appears as a character), the film is Bush (as well as bush!) It has happened before, with, for instance, ""A Clockwork Orange"". The book was Kennedy,the film was Nixon; Kubrick simply ignored the last chapter, in which the protagonist simply grows up and stops marauding. Read the book; ignore the film. Too bad some things don't seem to change.",2006
6,"It was a very good chance to see this movie today, just one week after the tragedy.  I know some people don't agree with the idea of ""Pay It Forward"", but thinking about the word ""possible"", and people who simply have never had a chance to think about what they can do for the world they live in, this movie may do something good for us.",2001
9,"This is one of those profound movies that affects you and leaves you reflecting about the movie and how it makes you feel and makes you wonder if you could effect people the way Haley did. With the tear jerking moments and the thoughtfulness of a little boy make this a great sentimental movie for most and possibly too unrealistic for others. You then think if it is unrealistic does it have to be can we make this a reality in our communities. While a 5th or 6th grader (Hayley Joel Osment) in a social studies class is given a difficult task to come up with a idea to change the world and to put it into action. That is where the idea of pay it forward is started. Osment does a first-rate job in this very emotionally charged role. Here you have a boy who does not have a father figure, does not really have a happy life. He has a emotionally unavailable mother who is a habitual alcoholic and struggles with two jobs. This leaves him with his own imagination to get him through his day. Which is projected well on screen as the fragile boy. The teacher played by Spacey fits him perfectly, his compassion, with a slight bitterness and at times is unpredictable and we cant help but feel engaged with his character. Although Hayley did a great job Spacey had some great dialogue. The way he attracts attention to his character and invites us in and then he spoils the experience with a single revelation. In this movie when he reveals how he got his scars are so dramatic and so perfectly retold that it brings a tear in your eye. Helen is just as superb as ever. The way she delivers her performance as a trailer trash, alcoholic that still has a alluring side to her. While she might not get the best pick of dialogue, she showed top form and added to the movie in a memorable way. Seeing her we may not long for her as our mom but we hope through the whole movie that she finds her way to take care of Trevor. You would think with a lot going against him you would then be wrong this only fueled his desire to help people and having a innocent view that maybe he can help his mom and teacher. He does end up succeeding in helping some people there even comes a TV story about him and the ripple effect he had on the people he helped and the people they helped. Watching this and living in the world we do today you see life is full of conflict and without paradoxes. Changing the world is a lot of work and takes conviction that not a lot of us have. You see a movie like this with a pie in the sky idea and you think this could never happen. It would go a long way if people were able to achieve this goal to make this suffering world a better place. If you have not been able to see this movie it is a must rent. You must take this movie under consideration and take the chance. With Trevors statement in the movie maybe we should try so we can see the whole world isn't really as bad as we may see. We all may want to mark our place in the world, but what would the world be like if we did a big favor to someone and they did the same to other people. I do wish they showed some more attention to the idea of pay it forward. But seeing in the end when the 2 big lives he helps change for the better. The end of the movie to a lot of people was not desirable I think it was necessary cause it ended up catapulting his idea. In conclusion this is more than a worthwhile film that shows a powerful message that there is good in the world and the differences one person can make. If you enjoy heart warming films then this is a absolute must watch. If you are tired of the same old rehashed movie ideas, unoriginal movies then another reason to see this. As the title says don't thank someone for telling you about the movie pay it forward and tell others.",2012

7,"I honestly can't figure out why the critics are not only disparaging of this show, but actually aggressively hostile toward it.  I would be the last person to claim ""Yes, Dear"" is a classic of television comedy, but it is a consistently funny show, with a very simple, archetypal conflict.  I get regular laughs from ""Yes, Dear,"" regularly trashed by critics, while I've never laughed a single time at ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" which critics slavishly promote.  YD is about a pair of couples, two sisters and their husbands, who live together in Los Angeles.  The older sister and her husband are lazy, irresponsible slobs who live in the guest house of the younger sister and her husband, who are fastidious to the point of neurosis. Most of the comedy derives from this dichotomy.  The husbands work for a movie studio (another source of laughs), and both couples have children. All three sets of grandparents are played by familiar comedic character actors and show up several times each season.  Obviously, personal taste governs what one watches on television (something critics have generally forgotten), but if ever a show has gotten a raw deal from the critics, ""Yes, Dear"" is the one.",2003

7,"I just watched a repeat episode of Yes, Dear and I was impressed with the improvement since it's debut. I would have preferred that Anthony Clark have remained on Boston Common which was a better and funnier show on NBC but they canceled it after a few seasons. Yes, Dear has improved over the time and striving to be better. It is one of the few comedies that gets better than worse with time. CBS was unwise to cancel this show for John Goodman, Jean Smart, Ed Asner, and Olympia Dukakis in Center of the Universe. Yes, Dear may not be the greatest sitcom but it is certainly better than Center of the Universe. I could not understand CBS' decision to cancel it in the first place. I love the guest appearances of Vicki Lawrence and Tim Conway as Clark's parents in the series. They are terrific company. Of course, Yes, Dear could better. But for a sitcom to work in television, it needs time to evolve. Yes, Dear may never become Everybody loves Raymond but it is worth a half-hour to watch. These are likable characters and the cast does their best in bringing light-hearted humor to television.",2003

The contrast of the two couples works very well, and the timing is also excellent. In addition, I find that unlike many sitcoms, although it includes a laugh track, they do turn on the laugh track to try to force moments to be ""funny,"" and it does not have 1 minute long laughing that makes the moments awkward (like everybody loves Raymond, which I do not understand.) This show is a gem, but not many people have heard of it. This makes me upset, because I think if more people saw this show, then it would be a larger success. In my area, ""Yes Dear"" is on T.V on TBS on weekdays starting at 4 o clock.",2006

The character of Greg has some absolutely hilarious moments that you would have to be heartless not to laugh at. Jimmy and Christine are adorable, and Kim is annoyingly hysterical. They have a perfect blend of comedic and heart-warming moments, along with situations that any parent experiences at one point or another. How can you not laugh at Greg shoving his mouth full of caviar and getting stabbed with an epi-pen in the middle of a high class restaurant with his pants down? Comedy gold.

Yes, Dear was a great show and I was shocked when it was taken off the air. I believe that the best shows are often cancelled while mindless drivel like The Office tend to last a long time.

Probably just as well they didn't cast the ultimate grumpy old bloke - Jack Nicholson - or it would all have been way too over the top. Insead we had excellent characterisations from four massively experienced actors, and those four guys they played gelled well, finding that the bond that united them, even after all those years, was stronger than the differences that divided them.",2005
8,"Having seen only a few of Clint Eastwood's films, I can't put this movie up against too many of his other films. However, considering the high quality of his other films, I was expecting a bit from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It was really entertaining. The plot is very good, very involving, and moves along at a nice pace. The acting is mostly very good, some of the minor characters seemed to be more or less miscast and not perfectly well-played. The four main characters all do excellent jobs in portraying their respective characters. I especially enjoyed the comic relief presented by Donald Sutherland's character. The characters are all well-written and their actions are credible, in nearly every scene. The special effects are pretty good, they look very real, and do a good job of convincing the viewer that it is actually happening, or, at the very least, it could happen. The end could be called poetic, without giving it too much credit. The actors all share very good on-screen chemistry. You believe that these people could have that friendship with each other. I recommend this to anyone who likes Clint Eastwood's directing style, dramas and science fiction. 8/10",2004
10,"Now the cast alone is enough to get me to buy a ticket to this film. Clint Eastwood both stars and directs this fantastic tale with the skill that accompanies every Eastwood film. He knows how to get the best out of his cast, which would hardly be necessary since the cast is what so many critics in the past have called ""Star Studded"". Donald Sutherland portrays the group's horn dog, James Garner the kindly country preacher, and Tommy Lee Jones the show-off who never grew up. Marcia Gay Harden is, as always, lovely and charming as the NASA Mission Director who must make sure the group can qualify for the flight. William Devane is the cranky Flight Director, and appearances by Barbara Babcock and Blair Brown make the show a little easier on the eyes, as if that were necessary. The photography is uncanny, and had to incorporate some of NASA's footage of the Space Shuttle and some EVA's (extra vehicular activities) and the entire film breathes realism from start to finish. But that's Eastwood for you. Great show, no problems for the kiddies, and might even inspire a few more astronauts down the road.",2012
7,"Despite my constant adulation of Eastwood's films of the decade ending 2009, I had never managed to see either Space Cowboys or Blood Work. Surely, I thought, I should be rushing to see both of these, given my fondness for that period of the director's career. Surely they would conform to this extraordinary block of raw talent.",2011
10,"How could the owner of a book shop who says ""Enjoy. It's dreadful but it's quite short"" not be anything short of hilarious. This is so funny, every line is funny. No boring minutes, no fake action, just plain comedy in a style i find very appealing. Crazily funny lines like ""Is space hot?"" ""Of course it is, where else do you think we get pineapples from?"" are acted so perfectly making it spectacularly entertaining. A must see. My favorite show for sure.",2003
9,"I just rented the Black Books series on DVD, knowing nothing at all about it. By the third episode, I had to rewind because I was laughing so hard I actually missed the rest of the scene. Tonight, I will tie my room mate to a chair and force her to become a fan as well. I would say the show is more for people who enjoyed Absolutely Fabulous and The Young Ones than fans of shows like Are You Being Served? It has a great deal of energy and runs off in many directions at once. ",2006
10,"I discovered this show quite by accident while checking out ""Father Ted"". a website rated them in the same ""top 10 britcoms"". I love father Ted, i Love Monty Python, Are you being served, Black Adder, all the classic britcoms, but this one is by far the best. The Brits make the best TV in the world and this is, in my opinion, their penultimate achievement. The cast is perfect and work incredibly well together, their chemistry and timing is impeccable. the sets, while limited are so perfectly lit and dressed you almost feel like you're in the shop. And, of course, the writing is genius, i cant think of a better way of putting i (not being a writer myself of course), its just genius. I am continuously amazed at how the British can make hilarious and entertaining television on a limited budget with a very small cast and a single set (maybe two), compared to American sitcoms that have huge budgets, ridiculous casts, expansive sets, and still manage to be barely giggle worthy. If you don't like the dry British humor then don't bother, but if you're what I like call ""inteligent and worth talking to"" then you will love this show, and be doing yourself a great disservice by not checking it out.

Then there is his assistant Manny who will do what ever Bernard says. Lastly there is Fran who is always drinking wine and trying to find a relationship.",2014

BLACK BOOKS was a breath of fresh air... while it lasted. Unfortunately, like most teevee worth watching, it didn't last long enough. Maybe it's just as well: had it lasted, I would've spent even more time slouched down on the couch, staring unblinkingly into that bright, pulsating light...",2007
9,"The reviews were extremely black and white for this art-house film.  People were either enthralled or bored to tears by the whole experience.  There seemed to be no middle ground.  Now, that's my kind of movie.  Any picture that can reap awards (Cannes Film Festival) and get lambasted by the general public at the same time will always pique my interest.  In respect, it was a rich, rewarding odyssey, much easier to get through than, let's say, even half of ""8½.""  ",2001
10,"It feels awkward to attempt to put Dancer in the Dark into words. Von Trier's film is one of those movies that truly change the way we think about cinema and its possibilities, and for such a film, words do no justice. Dancer in the Dark centers around Selma (Björk), a factory worker, who loves her 10-year-old son above everything else in the world. Selma is a happy, innocent creature who enjoys musicals for ""nothing bad ever happens in them"". These elements (mother's love for her son, joyfulness of musicals versus the hardships of every day life) create a whole unlike anything ever seen on silver screen.  Selma is rapidly losing her eye sight, but not her vision: she's the 'dancer in the dark' who is prepared to sacrifice herself to  keep the light in her child's eyes. Very early on it becomes obvious that this story can't have a happy ending. However, once you've accepted it, you can put your mind at ease and see the film as it unfolds from Selma's point of view. And what a view it is! Björk gives a performance of a life time - this little woman with a huge voice is all emotion all the time without ever  appearing overtly dramatic or cheaply sentimental. There's no weak link in the rest of the cast either, Peter Stormare as Jeff, Catherine Deneuve as Kathy and Siobhan Fallon as the prison guard to name but a few. The biggest star is still the director himself; von Trier demonstrates his talent in a superb fashion by both telling a simple story that will most likely break you heart and examining the ever-persistent ills of the life of the lower class of the American society. What about the film's musical character then? This is where von Trier triumphs the most by understanding the very essence of the whole genre - hope; hope that will live in our soul for ever if we'll only follow our heart.",2000
10,"This is the most horrifying movie I've seen (gave it 10, though). I had the sensation that I was witnessing somebody die - and like Selma in the movie, I just begged for another musical-show to begin... I couldn't stand it. Everything is so tormenting and you just need that last (but not last!?) dance... Bjork is stunning as Selma, and the music she has composed blew me away. Even though this is perhaps the movie that has left the strongest impression with me ever, I don't know when I will be able watch it again.",2000
9,"This is distinguishably different from the general Hollywood films or independent projects. It's not like anything done before. LARS VON TRIER, and BJORK, simply blow your mind away: such totality in delivery!",2000

10,"When I was driving to see this movie, I wondered how I was going to react to the film. Lars Von Trier had always been one of my favorite directors, but I was unsure if I was going to enjoy this film. After watching the film, I half to say that this was one of the best films I had ever seen. Lars von Trier used handheld cinematography perfectly and I was especially impressed by how he operated the camera himself. Also the way he used lighting and still cameras in the music sequences expressed the surreal daydreams of Selma.",2001
10,"Gene Kelly's musicals may never have tempted a tear, but this film sure did. This is the most creative and powerful film I've seen this year. I just got back so it will take a while to absorb where it fits in the hierarchy of great movies, but it is one of the few 10's I have ever given on IMDB. I went in knowing nothing other then that Bjork was the lead and that it was a Cannes favorite, I and was rewarded greatly. I am not closed minded, but I thought I would never again find a musical that so wrapped you up in the emotional core of the piece, such as the musicals that I enjoyed in my youth. Its style is experimental enough that I would be surprised if it got a Best Film Oscar nod, but never would I be surprised for any honors bestowed on Bjork, who torturingly WAS Selma for those two painful hours. She is a goddess.",2000
8,"Dancer in the Dark haunted me. This film was an amazing view into the human mind as well as a tragic story of hopeless hope, betrayal by others, and still remaining true to yourself. Bjork produces an inspirational performance, of which one would never think she is not primarily an actress. Some of her moments in this film bring you to tears with their absolute honesty. The ensemble cast are a godsend as well. Peter Stormare, Catherine Denevue, and David Morse in particular. Morse, playing the most varied and difficult character, succeeds with apparent ease. The only complaint I had of the film is that it was slightly drawn out and slow paced. However, it is still spiked with moments of surprise that knock you so hard, you are pulled back in immediately. With an incredible closeness to these people, Dancer in the Dark will make you think and stretch your emotions to the limit.",2000
1,"Seriously, a 7.8 on IMDb? My wife and I got roped into this from a fairly interesting summary: A woman losing her sight turns her reality into musical numbers as her life spins out of control.

10,"As a fan of Lars Von Trier's earlier works, as well as Bjork's music videos, I was quite excited to see a collaboration between the two.  I tried not to expect much, however, as many reviews of the film were quite poor.  I couldn't have been more delighted by the film.  Bjork's acting ability was superb (it is a shame she will not be acting in the future), and Lars Von Trier's writing and direction proved to be intense and incredible.  While he played with different themes in the genres of the Musical, the Neo-Realist film, and the Melodrama, he created a meta film, investigating human nature as well as the nature of film (or digital video) itself.  An incredibly emotional film, it also proved to be poignantly intellectual.",2001

I'm a very tolerant movie watcher, American or foreign. A film has to go out of its way to get me not to at least accept it. So naturally, I got sucked in by all the wonderful reviews this has received. I watched two ""downer"" movies this weekend -- ""Dancer"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" so it's not depression I'm put off by. But at least ""Requiem"" was somewhat interesting. ""Dancer"" was a pretentious crashing bore, and the choreography was downright stupid. The shaky ""nervous"" camera technique is nothing new. It was one of the reasons I could never stand to watch NYPD Blue. My wife, smarter than I, left the room halfway through. I let von Trier drag me at a slow crawl to the bitter end -- an end I was anticipating with relish before it arrived -- and not just the end of the movie, but the very specific end of Selma, the most satisfying scene in the movie.",2001

1,"SPOILERS AHEAD This movie is so unremittingly ""TRAJ-EEK"" it is funny.  My friend and I went for coffee afterwards and wound up laughing so hard while dissecting it that we were crying! I'm afraid we made a bit of a scene, but hopefully the other coffee drinkers got the message to stay away from this one. One wonders why the filmmakers did not just send Selma (Bjork) straight to hell -- do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Apparently that is the only terrible fate she managed to escape in her short, unkempt, unbelievably harsh and unbearable life.  What really kills this movie -- I refuse to call it a flim -- is that nothing about it makes any sense. A near-blind, delusional young mother would rather let her and her 10-year-old son, a true innocent, suffer unnecessarily in silence than stoop to asking for and accept help from well-meaning co-workers.  She quickly goes blind from this hereditary disease that also affects her young son and because the United States offers a better life and medical care (except the neurotic director -- and I am being kind -- wouldn't take a plane to the USA for authentic locales so the movie was shot in Sweden, which throws the whole thing off kilter from the get-go.  You keep thinking, what the hell?  You don't even see a filling station, TV antenna, McDonalds -- nothing that would make it recognizably America -- and this is the early 1960s. A major distraction.) Selma and son wind up isolated in Sweden-America in the bleakest of circumstances. She works in a factory that looks like it is located behind the old Iron Curtain. She apparently thinks she is being noble by not accepting any help from anybody, including a perfectly nice man who is in love with her!!!! -- she refused a ride home from him and is almost run over by a truck.  She'd rather stumble along the railroad tracks to find her way home than accept this small favor.  For psychic relief, she fantasizes about Hollywood musicals (only her fantasies are as bleak as her real life, so how can they offer any escape?), deprives herself and her son of any amenities (she doesn't want the son to know he is destined to go blind) and pretends to send money home to her father while socking it away for her son's eye operation only to have it stolen, clumsily (and most artifically) kills the friend who stole the money, goes on trial, is convicted and hanged because she thinks it is nobler to be hanged than betray the friend who stole her money. Oh, how noble can you get.  And she won't see the son in jail, because she's too noble Bjork does a fantastic acting job.  It's just too bad she couldn't comb her hair at least once.  I can comb my hair with my eyes shut, for goodness sake.  That's it, folks.  If this is what you want in a flick, they be my guest.  At least you might get a good laugh out of it afterwards.",2000

And I blame ""arthouse"" people for raving about this awful excuse for a movie.  How could anyone like anything about this movie?  It was horrible! I like a good character drama as much as the next guy, but this was bad. Someone else said that it should have been edited more.  I totally agree. W@e fast forwarded through the first hour, and still struggled to watch the rest of the film.  Let me put it this way:  whenever there was a room full of people, I'd put the movie on and the room would clear out in a matter of minutes.  Bjork was okay, but there was just no good story.  Here's one for you, ITS BEEN DONE BEFORE!!!!  I do love the soundtrack though... to bad the songs are different in the movie.  I would advise everyone to steer clear of this bad movie.",2001

The story line was disjointed and very difficult to follow. I can't comment on the individual acting performances because the terrible filming, editing etc were so distracting that I couldn't focus on the actors. One particular scene was so brutal that it was uncomfortable, but worst, it was totally unnecessary.

Even though I'm fully aware that it's just an excuse to sell cards of a trading card game I actually think the series has a lot of charm to it. The villains are all either scary or just plain funny, the duels can sometimes be exciting, and Yugioh is the only show I can think of that actually has great filler. In fact some of my favorite seasons of the show (The Noah Virtual World saga and the Waking the Dragons arc) While the dub by 4kids is littered with horrible voice acting, lame jokes, and plenty of cringe worthy moments the original Japanese sub had amazing opening and closing credits and adds a lot of substance to the story.",2011

5,"Yu-Gi-Oh is a fair enough cartoon with it's own clever plots. The main plot is one of a fantasy series that focuses both on the adults and children's. But most of the plots that are impressive, overdoes the childish behavior. The drawings are okay. Yu-Gi-Oh's drawings are normal just like any other anime.That is the human drawings. But the monsters are in good shape and have the potential destructive power whether tiny or huge in size. The characters have different qualities that make the show good but some of them spoils it and makes it useless to the series. Character development in the other hand is way better than Pokemon. The battling is clever and very impressive. It takes a lot of skills to play in order to be the victor. That must be the main reason I like Yu-Gi-Oh. The introduction is good and bad at times. The villains are very persuasive. Yu-Gi-Oh is recommended for boys from the age of 6 to 17. But the fans should not attempt to view because it is a disgrace to fans all over the world.",2006

It's simply impressive how besides very open language and pretty open conversations about anything in this relationship and sex area, there is nothing offensive in the script, and how almost every sentence is hilariously funny. ALthough all main characters are really great, I am almost more impressed with female characters because in many series of this (or any) type, they tend to be cliché, plain boring or stupid, or just annoying, but not these girls. They are cool as much as male characters even though writer is a guy. And that's just wonderful! Total recommendation, a must see!",2008
10,I don't like British shows (excluding Dr Who and Red Dwarf) and I find sex jokes vulgar. Coupling changed my mind and within a month of seeing one episode I bought the whole series. Yes there are many many sex jokes in this show but their delivery is not vulgar the way they are in American shows. I'm quite disappointed that there are only 4 seasons. Each show cracks me up totally. You cannot watch just one episode you must watch them all.

A lot of people like to compare it to Friends or Seinfeld which I don't quite agree with. I honestly cannot recall a single joke from Friends that would stand on its own, if not delivered by its cutesy/huggable main characters in their inanely padded lives. Seinfeld would be a more appropriate comparison in style, yet that show just wasn't that funny to me, no offense to its fans.",2012

The script was so beautifully written and the themes were well chosen that i couldn't believe. Of course there are better episodes but the level of quality never decreases below a certain point which is incredibly high. In addition, production, cast and all were excellent. The conflict and attraction between genders had never been funnier. But... Don't take my word for it, i became addicted to this master piece reluctantly.

One issue with this series is the believability. I have never known doctors to visit patients unbidden like they do in ""Doctors"". Every five minutes they are round at their patients' homes ministering to them and giving out advice, not telling them to keep taking the tablets etc like real doctors do. Some of the actors in this series are really quite good (usually the more experienced ones) the younger ones are obviously quite green. The story lines are becoming more bizarre as the series progress!! I have only just started watching it, about 3 months actually. There has been a Columbine-type shooting script (quite well done ) and a Misery-type one which just seemed too much!

""The Mill"", as the surgery is called, exists in what appears to be so kind of post-apocalyptic England - I say it's post-apocalyptic because I have never seen such a depopulated place as Letherbridge (the town/city where the programme is set) - the surgery receives a maximum of 2 patients per day (you don't need to make an appointment, just rock up and demand to see the doctor of your choice immediately), the university appears to have no students and, whenever they're in the towns only bar, no other customers or members of staff are ever visible. This lack of patients enables the doctors to go on mad missions every day, visiting their only patient's house and sorting out any problems that they may have. The programme is so unrealistic that one wonders why they bothered to base it around a GP surgery, something that most viewers would have plenty of experience of. Seriously, the plot lines are absolutely mental - I suspect that they are created by the producers scrawling words on pieces of card and swirling them around inside a tombola machine before picking a few out and using them to string together some semblance of a coherent story. For example, last Friday's episode was created by picking the words ""angina"", ""Los Angeles"", ""Down's Sydrome"" and ""phone sex"". Basically, it's mental and, as the TV in my work's reception is permanently set to BBC1, I'm forced to endure it 5 days a week.",2010

7,"Yes, it's clichéd, and silly, and has dodgy camera work and sets reminsicent of Crossroads. I don't mind that much. Why not? Because of a few things. One, it is random daytime TV, light entertainment. Two, occasionally they manage to use the cliché that seems to appear in every episode (of the defiant visited patient) quite well. Three, there are/were some cracking actors in it, which outweighed for me the fact were/are some terrible ones. Mac himself, and previously Ben, were both played beautifully, and the gay one (who I do not know the name of) is done well.",2006
9,"If only my local GP's surgery was like this, patients manage to get in, manage to see a Doctor and are greeted by a smiling receptionist. Its clear therefore that Doctors is a work of fiction, but its easy viewing. So often its thought provoking and engaging, many of the stories are believable and I'm sure based on real life happenings. It can be quite funny at times too its been a bit more serious for the last year. Doctor Carmichael makes the series for me. I almost wish this was on early evening, it would be suitable viewing for the 7 or 8 o'clock time slot. It's nice to watch a show on telly thats not full of bad language and unnecessary violence.",2015
1,"This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. Pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. Bonkers.",2010
2,"But then what do you expect from the BBC?

10,"Having sworn never to watch soaps when I was younger, I came across Doctors back in 2008, mainly out of sheer boredom. Let's face it, apart from the Wright Stuff, the good yet awful Jeremy Kyle Show (love that triple bill in the afternoon on ITV2) and the Kremlin Propaganda Machine that is RT, what else has daytime TV got going for it? Since then though, Doctors has ensnared me in it's strange and bizarre maw. Yes it's cheesy, yes it can be a little naff at times, yes sometimes it feels like the Family Hollins Show (great characters, but they don't half dominate the show at times, much to it's detriment IMHO). Yet it somehow manages to charm me into watching it again and again and again. Maybe it's the characters, Heston Carter has his way of adding a certain lightness to proceedings while Jimmy Clay is the vein of darkness that runs through us all, Zara Carmichael with her acerbic barbs and keen wit while the gorgeous Mrs Tembe keeps the faith in both God and Humanity. Maybe it's the story lines, in spite of said cheese and the midday slot (about as not-watershed slot as you can get), it does actually manage to cover some brave issues and themes, think the Harrison Keller/Lauren Porter murder story or the Treehouse story that led up to the 3000th episode. There is humour in there too, some episodes I found myself rolling around in laughter, but maybe that's just me and my twisted sense of humour. If you want deep philosophical or meaningful content or a deep storyline, go and read the Count of Monte Cristo or some Jean-Paul Satre. If you want to be entertained, watch Doctors. I have tried watching other soaps but none have grasped me in the way Doctors has. Only one question remains: why doesn't my GP take the same interest in my personal problems that characters on Doctors do? If only life imitated art in such a way, maybe the the world would be a better place.",2015

3,"Doctors is a long-running (somehow) BBC series and is possibly worst they have to offer. I know I'm flogging a dead horse here, but any piece of television with terrible acting, amateur camera work, absurdly clichéd story lines, and a seriously low-budget feel deserves a good slating. ",2016

9,"I can only comment negatively about one scene in the movie. I thought the movie was extremely effective in building up the intensity of certain scenes, however they used probably their most dramatic and climatic orchestra number for a scene where they simply dumped bags of money into a truck and drove off.

Their facial expressions and personal ticks speak louder than words ever could. In a world with seemingly no law, these two men get in way over their heads when they kidnapp the wrong surrogate mother. She just happens to be the surrogate mother to one of the richest men with the most mob contacts. Violence and mystery ensue as we see there are no heroes. The grand finale is a shoot-out that ruvals that of The Wild Bunch.",2005

The plot was hard to understand in some parts yet it was still good and sometimes the motives were beyond the viewer's grasp but it still flowed well regardless. There were some kick ass quotes as needed in this genre of film and James Caan was simply awesome in his role as an aging bag-man. While I'm not a huge fan of Ryan Phillippe he actually was passable as this character and utilized a suiting accent. Benicio Del Toro was probably the best as his expressions and just the way he says things is unbeatable. Even though it was two hours long it seemed like only half that, so overall it's a great watch. My only warning is that if you're included in the faint of heart then this probably is one to avoid as this was definitely a dab of the good OL' ultra-violence!",2004

And so, as I found myself confronted by this extraordinarily cool contemporary crime/western, I was shocked. This has all the makings of a generic film. The philosophical/amoral central team...  could've been Pulp Fiction redux. The wise older criminal sharing his wisdom with those below him...  If I really went into all the elements of this movie that could've been handled as shameless rip offs of other films, that list alone would take me over 1,000 words.",2000

8,"From the very beginning, I knew I was about to see something I hadn't seen before. This movie is nuts! This is one of those movies that has you sitting at attention because it is absolutely unpredictable. The action scenes are great because they're a stray from the normal ""heroes with impeccable aim"" shootouts that we're all so used to seeing. Check it out so you could see what I mean. The acting is pretty good and that goes even for Ryan Phillipe, who I wanted to strangle until I saw this flick. What is up with that accent of his in this movie? Where the hell is he supposed to be from? Benicio Del Toro does better here than he did in Usual Suspects. Sorry Fenster fans, but Longbaugh is the man now. The only complaint I had with this movie was that it was a little hard to follow. It's very easy to get lost here but pay attention, gang. This movie deserves it. A hidden gem. **** out of *****.",2001

I hated I Know What You Did Last Summer, he struck me as totally pretentious in the otherwise entertaining Cruel Intentions, and I have yet to watch Little Boy Blue, but needless to say, my expectations are fairly low. I decided to take the time to watch The Way of the Gun mainly because I thought the preview looked good (thanks, in no small part, to Benecio Del Toro), and I loved every second of it. I've heard some slightly negative things about it, but on the other hand, I've also seen professional film critics give Fight Club the lowest rating possible, proving that some critics just can't be trusted. The Way of the Gun is just about as good as a crime thriller can get.",2001

I can imagine an American moviegoer who finds the plot a bit to convoluted... hell, it's not perfect, I mean Juliet Lewis has certainly had less obnoxious roles... But you couldn't have missed the elegantly photographed and painstakingly arranged gunfight sequence, or the top notch performances from most of the cast, or the intelligent writing.

6,"This is one of the strangest films I have seen in a long time.  Bloated and pretentious, it is like an oversized car that grinds to a halt, spurting occasionally into movement.  Though humourless and cynical, it is an epic farce; epic because of the Western backdrop against which it is played; farce, because the whole project seems ready to collapse under its own earnestness, characters come and go unexpectedly, there's a lot of going in and out of doorways, the action shifts between distances thousands of miles apart, and yet the same characters seem to recongregate, as if some great big hand is moving the delf along a table.

7,"This film had a lot of great stuff to look for, but unfortunately, it lulled in spots, which is a downer for a type of Tarantino Resovoir Dogs type of flick.  Writer and first time director Chris McQuarie has a lot of good things here, but he might want to consider a little editing though.  There are, believe it or not, some not needed scenes here (maybe so, maybe not). But, lukcily, some of them are overshadowed by a better than average script and very credible actors: Ryan Phillipe and Benicio Del Torro make a good duo, Juliette Lewis is slutty yet charming in a pregnant role and most notably in one of his best roles, James Caan as a aging hitman who will get villain fans cheering.  Exceptional action ending and it's actors almost make up for some boring points in this film and it is worth a look whether it is likeable or not.  B+",2000
8,"In the long run The Way of the Gun will be rated a masterpiece. The story is compelling and the acting enhances the well written script. Both Phillipe and Del Toro are convincing and believable as two not very likable bad guys. The rating of this film is well deserved and it is questionable whether women can be very comfortable viewing this film, and that is said not in context of violence committed against women - although that does occur - rather, in the unsettling scenes in the last part of the film. Without giving anything away, it is sufficient to simply say the story concerns a surrogate mother and a kidnapping. Whether man or woman, it is not for the squeamish. Not having a main role, James Caan does what he does best - he plays a criminal as if born to do it. This is a dark film with an evil contemplation on the sanctity of life.",2006
9,"Deliciously satisfying. Like I said, a bit overblown, but never sinks deeply into the schmaltz and cheese of cheap giveaways to a least common denominator. Stops just shy of breaking the membrane of completely incredible, always leaves you an avenue of belief that it could happen. So watch it. This comment requires me to write ten lines of text. Okay, fine. Some of the characters were cutouts, but they were pulled out of the mold a bit, enough so that you buy it. James Caan is great as the world-wise old scumbag, so glad it wasn't Morgan Freeman being the wise old black guy giving advice to white people, which it could have been. Only the evil whore zillionaire harpy of a wife ""Francesca"" was a bit flat. But out of almost nine or ten major characters, that's not a bad ratio. I blame the script for that shortcoming, not the acting/directing. Oh- and the doctor, Dylan Kussman, could have been better. But his part was so impassioned, I'm sure it was a tough part to play. Anyway. It's really good. Go watch it.",2005

Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and retold several times over, but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew, and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment. It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950's, and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth telling, and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner, and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner.",2006

It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in. I love a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is.

I liked DeNiro in the lead, although its not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it is as good as his other good performances such as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart.

Cuba Gooding was outstanding as Brashear who held his ground to become a master diver. His calm perserverance, when most men would have walked away, convinced me that the character, whom he played, was a true man of honor. It was difficult to see Sunday as a man of honor since he brought all of his problems on himself. In the end, he somewhat redeemed himself, but only after becoming a powerless, broken man.

Gooding is another fine actor who has to completely ham his way through this. The rest of the cast is completely one-dimensional and shallow.

Anyway, for most of this film the camera focuses on Yuliya Mayarchuk's backside, but it's a nice backside so that isn't really a flaw. Yuliya Mayarchuk and her backside take the lead role, and she stars as a girl named Carla; who is on the lookout for some flats, right near a park filled with perverts and horny couples. She goes to an estate agent and meets a sexy woman named Moira, who wants her. She rents a large apartment and Moira gets her own way, and this causes trouble as Carla is in a relationship with a young man named Matteo.

I suppose it would have helped to know that subtitles weren't available on this film, but after a few minutes one understands that no subtitles are necessary, as it is easy to figure out, without them. Good to watch if you are enticed by lipstick lesbian love, and Italian horny boys and girls doing it. Great eye candy, and masturbation material/sex material.

Nevertheless I loved it and it's settings of Venice and London although actually in reality this seemed all shot on a set apart from outdoor scenes in a London park. Well paced, well shot and surprisingly well dubbed.

The nudity in this isn't offensive (except to prudes) and although very graphic at time (T n A n P) it's never inappropriate or gratuitous; a refreshing erotic masterpiece for Tinto Brass!",2008

6,"I find it funny that Tinto Brass - an Italian native - decided to place his most colorful and cheerful movie in years, of all places, in gray and rainy London. Even if we dismiss the fact that Brass apparently has a rather poor control of English, and didn't bother to check his dialog (what does the constable mean when he shouts ""Who's in charge?"" over and over again?) Trasgredire really doesn't look like it's set in London; but it looks better than Brass's silly, almost naive softcore erotica did in years. It's beautifully shot and lush with color; the opening sequence alone is worth the whole thing - it's sweet, sexy, funny, fast-paced and very much sets a cheery, light-hearted tone for the rest of the film. Tinto's work is always best when he doesn't take himself seriously, and Trasgredire is a movie that demands to be taken with as little seriousness as possible. It results in several scenes that manage to be erotic, arousing and very funny at the same time - other than the opening sequence, the phone scene also pops to mind.",2012
8,Most of this movie plays out as porn with the story of a love triangle where the girl in it Carla could have a good woman called Moira but she wants to be with an abusive overbearing jealous man who thinks relationships she had before she even met him means that she cheated on him once.,2016

1,"This tripe was perpetuated by a director who has no appreciation for history, and who sets himself up as an authority on ""what appeals to American moviegoers..forget for a moment the fact that the British first secured enigma from U-110. Forget also that there was only one incident in which Germans ever machine gunned survivors in the water and that was after the sinking of the Greek ship Peleus by one Heinz Eck, who, along with the ship's doctor and Executive officer were executed for this crime.( I guess we had to believe that the Germans were more sinister this way.) Forget also, that in Mostow's world, the laws of physics do not apply. I especially liked the scene where the torpedo is fired against the bow of the destroyer and the ship is stopped dead in its wake!! If you want a good Submarine movie, try Das Boot, or The Enemy Below. actuals, the incredible Mister limpet was more historically accurate than this garbage.",2005

And heaven knows, it doesn't require much study to realise that Yank submariners played a huge part in the war. The Pacific war, that is - not the Atlantic. There were some tremendous daring-do escapades with memorable victories. In fact, I understand that the American fleet was the most successful submarine fleet of the war, with also fewer casualties per unit vessel.

1,"Thank god for the US-Navy. The german U-571 is seriously damaged, so that the full, perfectly trained german crew isn`t able to run it. Of course a hand-full american sailors, who even can`t read the (german) instruments of the different machines in U-571 probably manage to get away with the submarine immediately. After being heavily bombed by a german destroyer, they are even able to reach an absolutely incredible depth. But not enough, of course they send the destroyer to the bottom with only one (coincidentally their last) torpedo. Not only the fact, that this heroic voyage is absolutely implausible and ridiculous, makes U-571 the worst movie I´ve ever seen. Also the story, that the Americans found and decoded the Enigma is just a falsification of history. Of course America did a lot for ending the nazi-tyranny, but in this case, it was the achievement of english sailors and scientists. I´m really not a german nationalist and there were a lot of good and even great movies about WWII ( e.g. Saving Private Ryan) but U-571 isn`t. It´s really a disgusting, poor effort of making money with the most primitive sort of patriotism.",2002

1,This film could have been produced in 1940 as well. What makes me so angry and sad is that this film teaches Americans today that Germans are still their enemies. It is an insult on all Germans today and especially those who fought in the damned war. Why is it necessary to demonize Germans in a Hollywood movie produced sixty years after the war? Do the Americans plan to make war on Germany? Or what the hell else might have been the producer's intention? Worst of all: the scene where the German crew machine-guns the helpless people in a boat. I as a German feel deeply offended by this movie and my opinion about America and Hollywood has changed in some points. I am angry about making the mistake watching this movie.,2001
1,"This movie reminded me of the first ""Star Wars"" because, although technically excellent, its emotional manipulations and subliminal messages promote an abhorrent, feeble-minded ""patriotism"" in which ""our"" side is noble, brave and clever while the ""bad guys"" are less than human. The scene where Harvey Keitel's character tells a sailor that he must blindly follow his commanding officer because of his rank is just one example. The heavy-handed use of musical cues to steer our emotions slips frequently into self-parody.",2000

The nauseating way that US film companies like to rewrite it to portray the US have having done everything that evere saved the world, and the jaw dropping way that certain section of the US citizenry lap this rubbish up with a spoon rather than crack a book open and get a good education beggars belief. The US did not get the enigma machine, the British did, and historically speaking, six months before this film is even set. How they did it would have made a genuinely engaging film, and judging by how many American actors long to strut their stuff on the London stage, I'm sure many would have been chomping at the bit to try out their foreign accents. No such luck here. Garbage.",2006
2,"This movie uses great effects and realistic settings, but the rest is fantastic superhuman nonsense. The U-571 was never captured by Americans and was sunk with all hands off the coast of Ireland by British aircraft, so I hope nobody gets his history from this. The Germans were furthermore quite humane when treating survivors in the sea, and while they could not take them on board, they rarely shot them all or deliberately killed them. The German navy commander Karl Dönitz was not found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. In fact, in 1942 the captain of U-156 tried to rescue survivors from a sunken British ship after radioing the allies, only to be attacked by American bombers which killed many of the survivors on the deck of the U-boat and forced it to dive, which killed the rest. The allies often killed German sailors who survived sunken U- boats or left them to die even when they could have saved them. This film is also short on realism. The German movie Das Boot was criticized by former U-boat sailors for its portrayal of depth charges being too close to the U-boat and not sinking it. Well, this movie had the depth charges a lot closer, the hull shaking like crazy, yet no rupture or major leaks occur. Depth charges don't have to hit the craft; they're designed to cause a crack or dent in the hull, and water pressure does the rest. Machine guns that fired from a German destroyer were enough to compromise the hull's integrity, but the boat still dives beyond its accepted limit after all that with no problems. The ability of a handful of men to operate a damaged foreign U-boat to achieve all these deeds and still survive to tell the tale is about as fantastic and unrealistic as you can get. It's a propaganda film with all its cheesy music, of pure good us versus pure evil them, and a pretty unconvincing one.",2017

The most unbelievable scene is that where the captured German officer attains a gun and shoots several times from a relative short distance at an American soldier. But this tough American has still enough power to snatch the gun from the Bad Nazi and kill this beast, before he dies himself.

3,"Often this film is compared with the classic of all Submarine films ""Das Boot"" . U-571 has in any respect got the worst of it. It has to be criticized that they tried to copy the older German film, which was so successful, with the difference that the heroes are Americans. ""Das Boot"" was written by a German submarine man of WWII. It was realistic, no exaggerations, except perhaps the feasting in the harbour. A human drama that took place a thousand times during the war in the Atlantic. But here with U 571 it is apparent that the US patriotism had to be satisfied. They are not interested in German heroes. They want to see US heroes. As always when the history is faked this is sometimes ridiculous. Nevertheless the film has dramatic moments. The film earned many critic especially in Britain, because the Brits were the guys who captured the Enigma"" machine, not the US. So far an audacious, almost incredible falsification of history. But be sure that this is common practice of movie makers! For the sake of entertainment. One has to understand that patriotic films have their own logic and their own legitimacy. Why the US is producing a lot of such patriotic movies which are at the same time lacking truth and reliability in historic correctness? Because the reality is too sobering and boring, I presume.",2009
2,"First of all, I have to say that I adore ""Das Boot"". Every sequence is wonderful, and even though it is more than 3 hours, it is never boring or unrealistic. I liked everyone in the crew, and almost started to believe that it had been better if the German had won the war.",2003

At the end, I found myself feeling good about it, which is refreshing today. Even better, it gave me an evening's entertainment without profanity, sex or senseless violence.

My brother and sister (5) and (9) both loved it and so did an audience full of children at the test screening. It is true that children above 12 may find it a little babyish.

It is rated PG for some mild peril, to which I would add that very young children would need to have some of the life and death issues explained.  Both my sons, ages 11 and 6, just loved the movie -- enough that my six year old wanted to see it again, and I didn't mind taking him.  The lessons my kids learned were mostly about friends coming in a variety of shapes and sizes, and the value of loyalty and dedication to a cause. There are enough plot twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat (at least the first viewing!), and although some of the dialogue is banal and predictable, some of it is deliciously witty.  Last but not least, the costuming and special effects are wonderfully well done, and go a long way to making even some of the silly scenes very impressive.  All in all, I would recommend it highly (to anyone who doesn't have trouble with the notion that vampires are not minions of Satan) as good, clean, amusing fun.",2000

Some of the special effects are a little ropey, while I liked the story in general there may be those who may find the idea of having an American hero in a film set in Scotland a little contrived and I think it could have been a tad longer. That said, the costumes are very nice and the scenery is a delight, as is the cinematography. People may find it rather bleak, but I liked the bleakness, I think it suited the film very well. The film is well directed and written, with some witty lines and a very amusing running gag about... wait for it... vampire cows. The acting is also surprisingly good. Jonathan Lipnicki is really cute, Rollo Weeks is charming and bright, Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige are campy delights as the parents while Jim Carter is suitably unhinged as the slayer.

Don't see a movie to learn about ""what really happened"" unless the film states very clearly that it is a documentary.

10,"Based on a true story, and dedicated to ten thousand Gloucestermen lost at sea since 1623, `The Perfect Storm' is a powerful movie that will take you places to which you've never been before.  Director Wolfgang Peterson has deftly crafted an intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat captained by Billy Tyne that left Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1991, and soon encountered the storm of the century.  After a less than profitable trip out, Captain Tyne (George Clooney) sets out again in October, with a crew of five men, and heads for deep water and a place know as the `Flemish Cap.'  It's a dangerous trek for that time of year, but he assures his men that the catch will be worth the risk.  What he could not foresee, however (nor could any meteorologist), was that three major storms would converge to form a single storm, the likes of which comes along only once in every one hundred years or so.  Fate steps in further when, after their catch is made, their ice making machine burns out, leaving them without the means of packing and preserving the fish.  They have no choice but to go back in, directly through the storm, lest the fish spoil, in which case all of their work, and the risks taken, would be for naught.  Tyne lets the crew decide; do they turn away and wait out the storm, losing everything, or do they prove that they're `Gloucestermen,' and try to make it back. 	What Peterson did with this film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with the novel, `Moby Dick;' as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time you're in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know what this boat is and how it works, you've smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. 	The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne; he knows him from the inside out, which enables him to convey a real sense of who this man is. And it shows in the way he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in his eye.  He's tough without any unwarranted theatrics or bravura, is self-assured, but aware of his own shortcomings, as well.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth; It's all there, and Clooney makes it real.  Mark Wahlberg, also, is outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).  Lane gives a notable performance here, too, as does John C. Reilly, who does an emotional turn as `Murph,' the veteran fisherman with a young son he loves, and who lives with the remorse of past mistakes that cost him his wife. 	Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in `The Perfect Storm,' but it's also inspiring; once you've seen the Coast Guard in action, for example, you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes this such a great movie, though, is that it's about real people, doing their jobs and going about living their lives like we all do. It's an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible, ones with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is an emotionally charged, unforgettable film; you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And therein lies the true magic of the cinema.  This is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss. 10/10.",2000
8,"Active, exciting, moving...depressing.  I have so many mixed emotions about this movie due to realising that more or less everything we see is true. George Clooney perfectly captures the busy, yet quite lonely man, that was Billy Tyne.  Mark Whalberg, who supported Clooney in 'Three Kings', also gives an excellent performance as Bobby Shatford.  The movie, on a whole, succeeds where a lot of films this year have - it's gripping.  The whole scenario of the storm, the crew, the boat and the relationships are so scarily captivating it's unreal.  However, if you don't know the ending or what goes on in the film, i won't say anything, but be warned!  This film has scarred my mind.  The performances from all actors are so good, i was depressed for about 3 days afterwards!  That is the only weakness however. It's a great film a really worth watching.  I would also recommend the book to anyone who hasn't read it - A bloody good read, although even that has it's depressing moments.  8/10 - worth purchasing because it could effectively become a classic.",2000

8,I have read a great number of user comments here and they make me laugh.,2000
1,"I am 52 years old and have loved movies all my life. There have been only 3 movies I have went to see that were so terrible that I got up and left the theater without making it to the end. I saw it on opening night. When we left I said ""stop"" ""I want to count heads."" There were only 7 people left in a sold out show!! The next day I was so shocked at the comments and reviews that I went with a second group of people and tried to watch it again, hoping perhaps I just had an ""off"" day. It was worse the 2nd time. I have never seen such poor film work ever. Soon into the movie I assumed the film was ""matted"" wide-screen because I saw many scenes with the characters foreheads cut off at about the hairline. I was stunned when one of the big waves hit the boat and knocked the main boom over. I thought I was watching an old 60's Godzilla movie. And then as the perfect ""tri-wave"" storm begins pounding the boat the scene moves to the inside of the ship. The crew is anxiously deciding what to do. They are SLOWLY LEANING from side to side. And behind them, outside of the main windows are these 40 or 50 foot waves slamming down just feet from the ship. Nothing on the tables are moving etc. etc. This is not to mention that the scenes were too chaotic to really see what was going on. They also were shot in deep brownish hues that were far from natural. That's not even getting to the fact that there is never an attempt to develop any of the characters. And the acting was ""B"" movie horrific. When both my groups left, after about an hour or more, I made the comment that ""I hope this boat crashes and takes everything with it, especially the film reels at the theater."" I then recanted and said ""I don't even care what happens to anybody in this movie."" If you want to see a good movie on the perfect storm, watch the ""White Squall"" or ""Wind"". Don't even waste your money on renting the video. I love George Clooney, but not here. I also want to note that I was hoping that at a 2nd theater, the movie at would at least display a proper aspect ratio. ""Maybe the first show had over-scanned the projection so as to cut off the tops and bottoms of scenes"". I was wrong. It was just as terribly displayed there. It is either being played back in 35 MM, matted to give us the 2:35 to 1 appearance of 65 or 70MM. Or it is just a terrible Camera man's eye for the scope of the viewer. Boy, I am sorry I am so negative, but this movie was that bad. I have heard many other comments from people who completely agree with me. Simply, one of the worse movies we've seen. And I like almost all movies in some way or another. Except ""The Perfect Storm""!",2000
5,"this movie is nothing to write home about...the acting is bad given the cast, but the special effects are pretty good. I had to laugh at the part where the captain had to torch cut the stabilizing anchor, pretty outlandish stuff. That's the problem with movies based on true stories. We don't know what happened out there to these people and it's a sad story, but adding outlandish dramatizations? does it work or take-away from it? This is the problem with the 1.5-2 hour movie time-frame, not very substantive, cheap and fast.... I especially had to laugh at the part where the captain finally declares that it's time to turn around...really? And I can't help wondering why they didn't divert to Newfoundland and wait the storm out? A little to late don't you think? If they had any notions that there was a hurricane brewing or, as the film implied, a broken ice machine where they had to get back or lose their catch, they could have gone to Newfoundland to make some other arrangements. It's an okay movie...but that's about it.",2016
6,"The visual and sound effects were truly spectacular. The story was based on truth, but suffered from what were obviously numerous embellishments by the screenwriters which, although necessary for broad general audience appeal, detracted from the core story, which had plenty of drama and suspense in itself.",2000
3,"This was a first, having never been to see this flick in the Cinmea or on TV. I only wish it had been on TV and not the box office.",2010
5,"A mixed bag.  Some of the acting was good - certainly better than ""Titanic"", but some made the eyes roll.  The storm effects were fantastic as advertised, but since they were so good, I have one question:  Why beat it to death with the symphony orchestra?  It seems ridiculous to imagine, but the makers of this film must have at some point looked at the great, rousing footage and said, ""It's not good enough.  Bring on the violins!""",2000
5,"Although I am not at all a fervent advocate of Hollywood movies, I was lured into watching this film, some weeks ago, in Paris, surely seduced by the chosen subtitle ""La nature est sans pitié"" (""Nature has no mercy""). I was obviously expecting a philosophical drama about the eternal struggle between Man and Nature, and, knowing that the film is based on an authentic event that took place only some years ago, an extremely violent storm on the Atlantic, in which none of the crew members of a small fishing trawler survived, I really wondered how Hollywood would treat the subject. The fact that a German was elected director added another suspense-creating factor: Would there be a surprising turnaround to the habitual glorification of heroism, to the idealization of Mankind? ",2000

8,"The idea of this film is pretty original; I don't think I've ever heard of a story so well-thought out about time-travel/alternate time-lines before. The idea is based on the main character being able to communicate with his father, who's been dead for 30 years. His father hears it then, 30 years earlier. They quickly do some things that shouldn't have happened back then, which then changes the future(or present). The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. The plot is very good, the acting is superb and the characters are all believable. The special effects are very good. The very idea behind the film is very good, but the way it develops so much further is amazing. The ending, while it may seem corny too some, and is, by all means, a bit of a typical Hollywood ending(some might even call it a cop-out), but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have. I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone who can watch a movie where they have to suspend disbelief, but especially anyone into time-travel or alternate time-lines, as this is, in my opinion, one of the best movies made, concerning this subject. 8/10",2004
9,"This unique and interesting film is actually more of a suspense thriller than a science fiction, although I think fans of both genres will be pleased.",2000
10,"Changing the past to affect the future may not be a new concept in film, but ""Frequency"" handles it deftly and with heart. The acting is superb, and as far as I can tell the plot is nearly airtight. It keeps you on your toes as the story twists in what feels like six directions at once and keeps you in emotional sync with the characters. The past/present connections are stirring and intriguing, especially the single-flash cuts at pivotal moments. This is one of the few movies about which I can honestly say, ""I laughed, I cried, I was scared stupid."" Truly the only good movie so far this year.",2000
10,"The plot in Frequency is hard to believe, but the movie's twists, action, and dramatic moments cover up its uncertainties.  The idea of how the past affects the future is not original, but the rest of the film is.",2000

It has been such a long time since a movie was made that warmed your heart, while keeping you at the edge of your seat. This movie will make you laugh, get a little misty in the eyes, and you won't even notice the time.  You're almost sad to see it end.  Dennis Quaid is excellent, this is his best movie in years.  This movie also has some new faces you won't soon forget.  Don't take my word on this, see it your self.  You will be thinking about this movie for weeks.",2000

10,"Wow, what a suspenseful film! This is a combination crime and fantasy story, a time-travel theme employed as a son is able to talk to his father 30 years in the past and help change history for the better. Far-fetched? Oh, of course, but it's not meant to be taken seriously as something that could happen. Like ""Field Of Dreams,"" it's pure fantasy but a nice father-and-son vehicle that makes you - or at least it did me - bring a tear or two to your eyes.",2006
7,"An atmospheric phenomenon over New York City allows a firefighter to communicate with his son 30 years in the future via a short-wave radio. Once they establish who they are, they have little time for small talk since lives are about to be altered as they seek to influence the past. Not only that, but a serial killer known for what became known as the Nightingale Murders is now back on the scene. What have they done? What can they do? And more importantly now, who will get hurt? I personally have been delighted to find on line reviewers of this film to have been as pleasantly surprised as I was. Many have focused on the fact that they didn't know what to expect, and thus got rewarded for being in the dark as it were. So with that in mind, I'm not about to start delving into the film too much, because if you are a potential first time viewer then you really are better off going in with no expectation level. What can safely be said is that Frequency achieves a rare feat of successfully blending genres and thematics. Sci-fi, mystery, fantasy, thriller, crime and drama all come into play in unknown director Gregory Hoblit's film. Nicely written by Toby Emmerich, the film also benefits from its fine cast of actors. Leading man is Dennis Quaid, who might just be one of the most safest go to guys in his generation, and support comes from a pre-Jesus James Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Shawn Doyle and Elizabeth Mitchell.",2009
8,FREQUENCY / (2000) ***1/2,2000
8,"The movie opens with the introduction of the Sullivan family. Frank (Dennis Quaid) is a heroic New York firefighter, and escapes a harrowing situation to return home to his wife and his 6-year-old son John. It's an exciting time in New York, as the 'Miracle Mets' have made the World Series. Frank is a ham radio user, and a strange disturbance in the sky (solar flares, I believe. I never took astronomy) in the sky has really increased the range of his radio. ""I'm reaching people I've never reached before"", he says. Flash forward to 1999, when young John has grown up into a 36-year-old NY homicide detective (James Caviezel) with relational problems (and possibly a drinking problem as well). We learn his father died several years earlier in a warehouse fire, and it's obvious that John has never really gotten over it. He ends up setting up the old ham radio (did I mention that the solar flares are back?), and contacts a fellow New Yorker named Frank. It certainly won't ruin any big surprise when I tell you that it's his father Frank--in 1969. After recovering from his astonishment and convincing his father who he really is (his knowledge of the 1969 World Series proves quite helpful), they begin a series of nightly conversations. Unfortunately, their conversations change the past--and the future--in very dangerous ways. A serial killer who should only have 3 victims suddenly has more, and John must use his knowledge of the crimes (30 years old to him) to guide his dad in a 1969 pursuit of the killer. And the chase is on. Will they stop the killer? Will the solar flares last long enough for them to finish their plan? Will anyone in 1999 or 1969 believe them? That lengthy 'plot summary' really didn't ruin any of the suspense--or come close to explaining the whole story. So, it goes without saying that the story is pretty convoluted and involved. But it's not hard to follow, and the movie grabbed me and kept me interested throughout. Granted, you will need to use a serious amount of 'suspension of disbelief'. If you get hung up on ""there's no way they could be talking to each other"" or ""changes in the past wouldn't immediately appear in the future--they would have already happened and would have been there all along"", you'll do 2 things: (1) you'll give yourself a headache, and (2) you'll miss out on a very entertaining film. The reason I gave this more stars than last week's ""U-571""? I cared about the characters, and I found ""Frequency"" much more entertaining. Also, the story was quite original--with great use of the Miracle Mets and the 1969 World Series throughout.",2012
8,"This movie moves fast. There are so many things thrown at you that watching the movie with subtitles is almost mandatory. First we are told that it's because of solar flares and the Aurora Borealis. Somehow, that event and a ""ham"" radio enable a father and son to talk to each other through the time gap of 30 years. It's a time travel movie without anyone actually traveling through time! The son tells his father what to do to avoid dying in a warehouse fire and that sets off a series of ""ripples in time"" that change everything. His dad lives on but his mother dies. She is killed by ""The Nightingale Serial Killer."" That's not supposed to happen! Through a series of actions,dad is able to thwart this otherwise inevitable event. But as one thing is changed, it sets off an unpredictable chain of events that could not have been anticipated. Extremely well written until the happy climax where everyone lives and only the murderer dies, in two time periods, simultaneously! That is the paradox of the movie: how can the same person get his arm shot off in the past yet survive and die 30 years in the future? Wouldn't he have bleed to death? At that point, the movie wraps up with breakneck speed and we are left both ""dazed and confused,"" watching everyone play baseball! My theory is that the radio was somehow the time-link; more so than the atmospheric phenomenon. However, the movie manages to satisfy on several emotional levels, especially the ability to speak to a loved one that we miss so dearly. There is a ""haunting"" quality to the film that makes you want to watch it more than once. Cutting-edge special effects. Rated PG-13: graphic and intense content.",2013

8,"Director Gregory Hoblit brings us ""Frequency"", an intriguing science-fiction tale that was as thrilling and shocking as it was heartfelt and emotional. The movie is about John Sullivan (Caviezel) a Cop who has never recovered from the death of his father, Frank (Quaid). However, after a series of miraculous cosmic events, John is given a chance to communicate with his father in the past. Now, when I initially examined this film for what it was - a movie with a respectable premise, but directed by a guy I had never heard of, and starring a group of actors who aren't really well-known - I was rather apprehensive about watching it. Though, after actually watching ""Frequency"" I can say that my expectations were pretty much demolished. What threw me for a loop was the direction that this movie took. All I expected ""Frequency"" to be was a long, drawn out reunion between a father and his grief-stricken son (which sounded to good to me. . .but didn't really sound spectacular). But, about a third of the way in, ""Frequency"" turned into a very intense crime thriller. That being said, the film excels at interweaving thrills and poignancy without making the transitions feel jarring. The acting was very well executed I'd say, for you learn to feel for both Frank and John Sullivan as ""Frequency""'s intriguing plot thickens. The script was pretty well-written too. Overall, I'd say that ""Frequency"" was an entertaining sci-fi flick that offered a variety of gratifying elements within it.",2011

9,"""Frequency"" is very underrated!  I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters.  I saw it twice on cable, and now that I bought the DVD, I watched it again.  I was just as intrigued as when I watched it the first time! Needless to say, the premise is extremely original.  I seem to always connect well with films involving father/son relationships, since I don't have an ideal relationship with my father.  So it was really sweet to watch a film about a guy communicating with his deceased father, and watching them bond and chat about the All-American game.

It can get rather graphic at times, but that's mainly because of the subject material, I guess. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant.He has a real knack for bringing strange and twisted characters to life. Michael Caine is doing his usual job of being superb as well. Every new role Kate Winslet performs is different from the previous and she excels every time. She expresses emotion very well. And my goodness, Joaquin Phoenix. I wouldn't say that I was ever a *fan* of his, but damn, now I am. If there was ever a performance that just made me melt, this was it.

9,"Quills is a delightfully unsettling account of the demise of the Marquis de Sade and those he brings down with him. The film presents viewers with all the evidence they need to identify the fallacies of society's separation of ""good"" from ""evil"" and ""moralists"" from ""sinners."" It subtly asserts that the values traditionally used to pass judgment are compromised by convention and religion, and that there is moral danger in accepting these values without question.",2005
5,"I really wanted to find things to like about ""Quills"", given Geoffrey Rush being cast as ""the divine Marquis"", and Philip Kaufman directing (who previously made the excellent ""Henry and June""). Alas, ""Quills"" is little more than a standard Hollywood-style morality tale, sexied up as much as possible by Sade's notorious writing. It also takes pointless liberties with historic fact, changing many aspects of Sade's life and exploits. It also serves up some of the more absurd devices I've seen in a ""serious art film"".",2006

It is one of the most brilliantly directed, acted, produced, and written films I've seen in a very long time.

2,A lot of people might have been allured to see this movie for the huge bundle of superb actors and actresses who participated.

5,"Philip Kaufman's movie of Doug Wright's play pits the Marquis de Sade, by this point committed to an insane asylum, against a sadistic doctor brought in to cure him of his transgressive thoughts and writings. De Sade is abetted by the asylum's rector who sees him as a troubled soul and by a washerwoman who smuggles his writings to the publisher. It's all meant to be rather provocative, but in Kaufman's dry telling it comes off as tame, soft and not a little condescending. Kaufman keeps trying to teach the audience that de Sade is someone they should get to know, a philosopher who meant no harm; but he gives little evidence of de Sade's real writings, portraying him merely as a sensationalist novelist of the day who just happens to antagonize royalty and preferring to leave his audience unaware of the real content of the works. Kaufman indulges his actors and lets them overact to their hearts' content. This is not a good thing: Geoffrey Rush (as de Sade) and Michael Caine (as evil Dr. Royer-Collard) are not performers that can chew up this stuff and still manage to maintain dignity. Still, Kate Winslet doesn't embarrass herself and Joaquin Phoenix is rather compelling in a silly way as the rector.",2002
1,"I saw the movie.  I liked it.  I loved Michael Caine's performance. Michael Caine is always great.  I was also stunned by the stomach-turning depravity of the French legal and medical system of the time.  Then I read the book. The first half of the movie is typical Hollywood bad history: composite characters, events out of sequence, a devoted wife where there should have been a devoted mistress, etc.  But the second half is fiction. In fact, De Sade (b. 1740) spent the last 10 years of his life, 1804 - 1814, living in relative comfort, with a mistress boarding in an adjacent room, at his family's expense, in the Charenton Asylum.  By this time de Sade had spent a major part of his life in and out of prisons and asylums for sexually abusing prostitutes and servant-girls, and also for complicated reasons connected with prison escapes, bad debts, and the French Revolution.  He had even been sentenced to death at one time (1772). The pretext for his final imprisonment (he was now 63) was publishing pornography.  But the real reasons were complicated. He was notorious and infamous, both for his crimes and his pornography. Napoleon wanted him put away, because he believed de Sade had written a pamphlet defaming him and his family. The family wanted him put away to protect the family honor.  The asylum was under the control of the French Ministry of the Interior.  It was run, except for the last 7 months of de Sade's life, by an Abbe' Coulmier, and at one time a Dr. Royer-Collard was the medical director.  There was also a 17-year-old worker in the asylum, Magdeleine Leclerc, with whom de Sade had (by his count) 57 sexual encounters during the last year of his life. The Abbe viewed himself as a humanitarian not a jailer and respected de Sade as an intellectual.  The Abbe has been described as despotic but enlightened.  While de Sade was in the asylum, he continued to write and publish (anonymously) pornography; but he also wrote and published ordinary plays, many of which were performed at the asylum, and choral pieces, some of which were performed at the asylum's church. There were sporadic attempts to curtail his writing activities. In 1807 police seized one of his pornographic works during a search of his room.  It was dutifully returned to his family after his death.  (They destroyed it.)   In October 1809 he was briefly placed in solitary confinement and deprived of writing materials.  In 1813 the Minister of the Interior banned the performance at the asylum of the plays. But all things considered, de Sade was pretty much left alone. He was in failing health during the last 4 months of his life and finally died of natural causes at age 74.  His surviving son was visiting at the time, but missed the last moments. What is particularly troubling about this movie, is that it uses the correct names of people and places. >",2001

The doctor vows revenge on the Marquis and even more so when Simone runs away with an architect after reading one of his most lewd novels to date. The Marquis is stripped of all his privileges; first his paper, quills, and ink are taken but he refuses to be silenced. With tragic consequences. As the punishments grow more severe and each knew novels written b something disgusting objects the marquis and the doctor are locked in deadly battle over power and control, which sends the law and order of Charenton asylum downhill as the fight takes a twisted and unexpected turn. A thrilling story with many twists and turns where egos collide and love interferes where power and money speak and authority is threatened.",2005
9,"This is the first Philip Kaufman film I have seen, and I was impressed. Although it isn't the most pleasant to watch, its great. A dark look at an insane erotic storywriter named Marquis De Sade (Rush) and his stay an asylum run by religious priest Abbe Du Coulmier (Phoenix). While there he befriends a laundrette named Madeleine (Winslet). The film has great performances, a brilliantly written script and great direction, although running a little over an hour the story is so rich and characters developed well enough for one to really enjoy it. Like I said it wasn't the most pleasant, however it is a bit exaggerated and satirical account. My favorite performance came from Joaquin Phoenix, who was great, however Geoffrey Rush was better than I have ever seen him, fully worthy of his Oscar nod. Michael Caine was decent in his role although i didn't feel his performance as much as i usually like him (hes a fine actor). Kate Winslet was great in her role, this is my favorite acting from her besides Eternal Sunshine. The script is very good in this film, which is what makes it work, because a lot of these films about medieval, napoleonic, etc.. times in europe are a bit boring, but this one is quite entertaining. Although I didn't think the ending was perfect (a bit flawed), i still enjoyed this film a lot. 9/10 #123 on my list of all time favorite films",2005
6,"I haven't written a review on here in a while, but I felt as though I should write a few comments on this particular picture as I have always been fascinated by the Marquis De Sade. Perhaps my expectations were too high going into the theater to watch this film with an kind of unbiased mind, because I was let down. I went expecting what could have been a break-through film, that really could have said a lot about the society we are living in today, but it did not even come near to fulfilling those expectations. As just an ordinary film it was good. The writing was top notch. The performances were all very good, especially Geoffrey Rush who I believe is one of the most under appreciated actors out there today. I can't think of many film stars that can compare to his talent as an actor. The way he plays a character is  similar to Peter Sellers, yet much deeper somehow. Geoffrey Rush did not disappoint at all and if anything is going to win an Oscar in this film it will be his performance. The other actors put in adequate performances, with Phoenix, Winslet and Caine seemingly going through the motions of putting in good, but hardly Oscar worthy performances. I should be fair and say that Caine had a couple of scenes that were gems. Also, cheers to newcomer Amelia Warner, I suspect there's going to be a bright future ahead for this young beauty. However, the writing and performances were not enough to make this a great film. What I think was most aggravating was how little we really learned about the Marquis De Sade, at certain points it seemed like he was hated just for being a wicked gossip, while at other times he came off as a dirty old man. The Marquis De Sade was an amazingly complex figure because his ideas were so perverse to the absolute extreme and yet his expression of those ideas was utterly brilliant. We did not see many of those qualities in this film at all. The story of the laundry maid was twisted and changed around, as were a few other characters in this story who were real figures. This made me ask, why couldn't this film simply have told the life of the Marquis De Sade as it was, rather than changing the true story into a fictional one that is far less interesting? At times I almost felt like I was watching ""Disney Does De Sade"" it was light and fluffy when it should have been provocative and erotic. I don't usually complain about how a film should have been made, but this one could have been much better.",2000
8,"A baroque and quite entertaining film about the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) and the conflicting reactions (disgust, titillation, excitement, abhorrence) his ideas and writings fostered in those exposed to them.",2010
8,"I admit, that most of this film is purely fictional, including de Sade's body weight, since he became a fat old man in prison. Fact is though, that de Sade was a perverted man and that he was a guest at the asylum that is depicted in this film for many years. The fact that the events in the film are not true does not take away anything of the films quality. On the contrary, the story is quite intriguing and very thrilling and I must say I thought it was very well thought of. This intriguing and thrilling story I am talking about, of course is made up by the fictional part of the film, but there is more to this film than the fictional part. There is also the thought provoking and maybe even funny side of De Sade's writing that also leaves quite a mark on the film. And this is the part, which really makes this film. Where some films lose the essence of the main character this film succeeds in preserving it and presenting it in a charming and quite funny manner. During the film, the viewer is able to understand the people who read de Sade as well as those who burnt his books. I mean just think of the things he wrote and imagine yourself 200 years ago. Of course there were turmoils. But also imagine yourself when you were younger, when everything that was bad or forbidden was a thrill and you did it, even if it was just for kicks. These two reactions are both perfectly human, although I cannot say whether the treatment and imprisonment of de Sade was quite accurate. I mean the funny thing about the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was that people probably knew some of the 'perversions' (such as being homosexual) described in the books, but it was not common to speak of them let alone write them down.",2003
1,"What a disgusting, self-indulgent, boring and pointless film.  This has nothing at all to do with the life of the Marquis DeSade--it's almost entirely a fabrication.  The plot, such as it is, is sl-ow and bo-ring, and drags on and on and on for an interminable 124 minutes (seems much longer). Substituting shock value for ideas and revulsion for character development, the movie proves once again that a promising actor can do great damage to his career by accepting roles that are beneath him.  I saw the movie some months back and haven't been able to stomach another Geoffrey Rush film since. I was reminded to write a comment because I'm in the midst of reading the excellent At Home with the Marquis De Sade by Francine Du Plessix Gray (available on Amazon) and it made me angry once again at the disdain for truth and art shown by the people who threw together this cesspool of a film.",2002
3,"Considering the well-known cast, and the way the story was progressing, the last half hour of this story has to be - and this is putting it mildly - a major disappointment.

Such a pedigree might suggest lavish country houses, costumes and decor; large-scale set-pieces; ripe, theatrical acting and choice lines of dialogue; in a word, CULTURE.",2001

Joaquin Phoenix, the priest over Charenton mental institution, who treats the patients, including the Marquis, with humanity and kindness. Michael Caine, the medical scientist(more like certified torturer, whose methods include dunking the disturbed in water among other ways)who arrives at Charenton at an advisory capacity.

I don't know why this is disdained so much.  Sure, it's no ""Rushmore"", but it has its place and I enjoy it for what it is--a kind-hearted, dumb, funny comedy in the vein of ""Dumb & Dumber"" or ""Tommy Boy""--both classic movies in and of themselves.  In that category, I give ""Little Nicky"" a 10!  Blow-hards and elitists need not apply....",2003

10,"An absolutely brilliant and ingenious comedy. I am puzzled as to why this movie received such average reviews. I never listen to critics anyway. This film has so many angles. It's a fish out of water story with Sandler lost in New York, spoof of the punk rock genre, the damsel in distress theme, hilarious cameo with Rodney Dangerfield in Hell, the sarcastic talking dog, the John Lovitz peeping tom episode, sight gags galore, and the ultimate pineapple in Hiter's you-know-what. I laughed myself silly. This flick is raucously entertaining, but you need to appreciate Sandler's humor, which is an acquired taste, like beer. History will be kind to Sandler I think. Now for a true remake of Mad Mad Mad Mad World, with Sandler, Lovitz, Martin, Carrey, Murphy, and the rest of the SNL crowd.",2005

7,"When I first watched this movie, I was cracking up!  And it was one of those incidents in which I was in a crowded theater where I was pretty much the ONLY one laughing at most of the gags!  It wasn't exactly embarrassing, but kind of weird.  Then again, most of the people that came to see it were mothers and fathers with little children.  Please ignore the PG-13 rating--this is NOT a movie for the young ones!  I think anyone who has seen Sandler's previous films should know that by now.  His sense of humor may be immature, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate for little eyes to see. ",2001
10,"Let me explain something about Adam Sandler's movies (and his recordings and his SNL shows). His humor is something you either like or hate. There's no middle situation and there's not really a category for it except for 'Adam Sandler humor'. It also came to my attention that the people who think that Sandler is stupid, think the same of Jim Carrey and almost any other pure comedian, which narrows down their comedy taste to 'Scary Movie'.",2001

Anyway the movie centers around Nicky a very geeky devils son who is sent on a mission to get his evil brother back for his Daddy Satan. The film is a must watch for Adam Sandler fans and just goes to show that people take movies too seriously now days like Adam Sandler movies are meant to be watched and after you watch them you are meant to say ""man that was a no brain comedy"". Overall watch this movie for a laugh and not particularly for anything else. I rate this film a fair 73% for making me laugh.",2007

We're introduced to Nicky who 'jams' with some large random weapon, his dad's assistant is basically used as the introduction to the plot, his dad (the devil), played by Harvey Keitel for some odd reason, is making the decision on who should be his successor for then next 10,000 years. It never explains why someones 'in office' for 10,000 years but there's not much need to care anyways. He also remarks on how Nicky was pretty until his brother hit him in the face with a shovel, foreshadowing his brothers as the antagonists. Basically, his dad declares himself ruler for another 10,000 years and Nicky's 2 brothers go to earth freezing the gate to hell, thus causing the devil to die for some reason(?), Keitel's finger falls off and Nicky starts his journey to return his brothers to hell.",2009
1,"As a big fan of movies in general, and comedies in particular, I was EXTREMELY disappointed, even slightly offended, by this dreadful piece of garbage. Of all the films I've thus far rated on the IMDB, ""Little Nicky"" now holds pride of place as the worst film to date. Whatever possessed such fine talent as Harvey Keitel and Reese Witherspoon to stoop so low as to involve themselves with this horrid mess? And Rhys Ifans, after such a memorable, and genuinely funny performance in ""Notting Hill"" - shame on you! In fact shame on everyone involved in this mind numbing, boring, tasteless, waste of celluloid. If ever we needed proof that Adam Sandler's star has fallen big-time, then this is surely it. I truly enjoyed ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Happy Gilmore"", but then, those movies were actually funny! ""Little Nicky"", unlike ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", isn't even unintentionally funny. My advice to those folks involved in the creation of this trash, perhaps it's time to consider a new career, in say, waste management. 1/10",2001

Yes, it's crude, but it's clearly not made to be sophisticated - the special effects are terrible and Adam Sandler is at his cheesiest best. That's what gives this movie its charm - the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously.",2013

Oh, it'll make you laugh at times, but you'll hate yourself in the morning for it.  Simply put, in regards to credible comedy, `Little Nicky,' directed by Steven Brill, comes in somewhere near the bottom of the food chain, cinematically speaking.  One of the running gags in this film has Nicky responding metaphorically to whomever, when they ask where he comes from, `The south-- the deep' south--'  Which is somehow ironic, because that's exactly where this kind of humor seemingly originates, and belongs.",2002

1,"Let me first off say that I have enjoyed all of Sandler's movies up to this one. Gilmore, Madison and Boucher were all funny characters and enjoyable films. However, this movie is rancid! I think Sandler and his buddies got stoned, wrote,shot and produced this film in one weekend. There appeared to be no editing involved whatsoever. A ton of performances that were phoned in. I was shocked at how poor this film was. Although there were a few indications ahead of time that it was not that good of movie. For example, there were five other people in the theater when I saw it on a Friday afternoon. Moreover, Sandler had gone on a wrestling show to promote it, etc.... If you like Sandler, go rent one of his movies, because this one was ""bad as hell.""",2000
1,"Because that's the only possible reason that this film exists. The movie is imaginative, I'll give you that, but it's a smack in the face to anyone who believes that hell is a terrible place, or that heaven isn't populated by bimbo angels. Every scene in this movie falls flat. Satan puts women's breasts on a man's head. How is this even remotely humorous? When you have a sight gag, it is usually in context, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin both knew this and they made movies decades before the people who made this movie were even born. This film is filled with bizarre images and weird sight gags that are too strange to be funny. A blind man with weird eyes stumbles through the streets of NYC, ranting and raving. Is this supposed to be funny? The devil's son introduces Henry Winkler in Central Park and the crowd cheers. Come on...Henry Winkler, for god's sake? Can you imagine any group of people in this day and age actually cheering for Henry Winkler? Then for some strange reason he covers Henry Winkler in bees. See, there is no context for this sight gag, it makes absolutely no sense. It's like that weird long-lost clip of the Marx Brothers pilot for their 60s show that surfaced several years ago, it was bizarre and unfunny, something about angels, and they're all well into their sixties. It was pathetic and weird.",2005

The only redeeming part of this movie was when it was finally over, I didn't have to watch it anymore. The whole flick is loaded with stupid humor and HORRENDOUS acting! Adam Sandler is truly awful. I am curious as to who exactly the target audience for this movie is? I wish the rating scale had a zero, because that is what I would give it. The writer should be ashamed of this swill.

7,"A good old-fashioned scary movie, avoiding irony and self-referentialism at every turn, this film relies on a nice premise and some well-executed creepy atmosphere for its impact. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together as a middle-aged couple, with Pfeiffer particularly effective as the homey (though obviously ridiculously beautiful) mother left alone when her daughter heads off to college, working herself up into a panic at various, vaguely spooky goings-on around the place. The film plays its cards close to its chest throughout, working the old game of keeping the audience guessing for a good while ? is there really something supernatural going on, is it some kind of creepy but human plot, or is it all in her head? Of course it's all revealed in the end, in a solidly scary, thrilling and well-executed finale. A classic it ain't, but it has a kind of workmanlike, reliable quality oozing out of every scene.",2001

The plot wasn't anything to write home about, it's been done about 100 times before, but it was just done better than it has been in recent memory. Seems that movies try to over-do everything lately with special effects, gore, music and violence. Not here... I kept thinking that they had taken a step back and returned to what makes movies spooky. It's not a computer generated demon, or a high intensity soundtrack; it's a creaky door, it's a reflection in the glass, it's that feeling when you know you just pushed that chair in a minute ago and now it's away from the table again. That's what makes people uneasy, that's what makes them check their closets and sleep with the hall light on when they go home.",2000

Each of the respective critics dislike What Lies Beneath in both its construction (camerawork and plot development) and its effectiveness in creating suspense.  While this movie is enjoyable regardless of whether it was viewed on opening weekend or whether it is the third or fourth viewing on television, it is more understandable that Ebert and Roeper had some issues with the film during its theatrical release (whether they have altered their views upon its DVD release, I do not know).

Still, I was hooked for about a third of the way (once the wife supernaturally took on the persona of a missing woman and seduced her husband with a little licking and biting, I began losing faith). By the finale, so many gimmicks are being thrown at the screen, it just becomes an upscale B-flick. All the inconsistencies aside, one has to applaud Michelle Pfeiffer for her gratifying performance; even though the entire subplot about Pfeiffer's neighbor leads nowhere, she is very appealing walking up to the man in public and calling him a ""murdering son-of-a-b*tch"". Harrison Ford is fairly solid as well, until the last act which leaves both he and Michelle completely rudderless.

Great acting from Harrison Ford and Michelle Phiffer really make this movie what it is...A good thriller.  They convey the feelings very well. Robert Zemeckis is also a great director and the angles he uses in this film help give it that extra mysteriousness. The movie is also driven by its great soundtrack, reminiscant of Psycho-esque music. The movie is not exactly scary, but it is a little freaky.

As the company's first project, Zemeckis chose screenwriter Clark Gregg's ""What Lies Beneath,"" a modern-day ghost story that, the director told his crew, he wished to bring to the screen as Alfred Hitchcock might have done, IF the Master of Suspense had had access to modern FX technology and computer graphics. (Never mind that none of Hitchcock's 54 films dealt with ghosts or the supernatural per se.) Filmed largely in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont, near Addison, during a hiatus from shooting ""Cast Away,"" the resultant picture, released in July 2000, was still another significant feather in Zemeckis' already crowded hat, and, like those other films named, features impressive yet subtly integrated FX to complement a highly intriguing story.

9,Every new animated film seems to break new ground in technique and execution.  Technology and computers have brought animation to new heights of excellence.,2000
10,This has got to be one of the most hilarious animated movies of all time. The situational comedy is truly amazing.,2000
8,"There is nothing much that is bad that is to be said about this film. The characters, Tulio and Miguel, were fun, entertaining, and the plot itself was much the same way. I was surprised, however (though not necessarily disappointed), at how Disney-like this movie was, coming from Dream Works. Dream Works tends to go for a more ""crude"" or ""sarcastic"" humor. They don't seem to like using two scrawny, goofy men as main characters or having an antagonist that is so evil that you can hardly express how evilly evil he is. Both of these were present in the movie, as well as a scene where Tulio and Miguel *gasp* dance and sing! Verrrrry Disney-like if you ask me.",2006
8,The only thing they could have improved upon was the story.  And it wasn't bad.  Just a little slight to hold up for an hour and a half.,2000
10,"First things first, I am 56 years old and I have to say that I adored this movie. It didn't seem childish or silly at all, on the contrary it had language and dialogue that my 6 year old grandson wouldn't understand! The plot was exciting, the characters deep. Towards the end when I thought that Tulio and Chel were leaving Miguel for good, tears sprang into my watery blue eyes. I almost couldn't stand it! The part in which the chief played ball with the village children was so adorable! The movie wouldn't be complete without it.",2005
8,"Let me start by saying that I liked 'The Road to El Dorado'. It has some nice songs, good animations and it was very funny. I especially liked the horse Altivo. The thing that bothered me is that most of the things on screen I had already seen in other movies. Well, one in particular. Two guys come to a strange place. They are mistaken for Gods because a miracle happens by accident. They have a plan to steal the gold in that place, but one of them wants to stay. This is 'The Road to El Dorado' but also 'The Man Who Would Be King' from 1975 starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Here we Tulio and Miguel voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. They have the same funny chemistry as Connery and Caine had. In 'The Road to El Dorado' we have also a love interest, Chel (voice by Rosie Perez), and a high priest named Tzekel-Kan (voice by Armand Assante) who doubts the divinity of the two men. I liked it, but not because it was very original. If you haven't seen 'The Man Who Would Be King' you are able to enjoy this movie also for the story. Anyway, you will not be bored.",2003
7,"As a new non-Disney animated film debuts I always find myself asking will we ever have one that can match Disney's musical timing and humorous tone. ""The Road to El Dorado"" is one of those that comes really close to being as brilliant as Disney. The films title talks about a path that leads to the mysterious Mayan ""City of Gold"". This myth has been passed down for hundreds of years. In the 1500's a lot of Spanish conquistadors went to the New World in search of this city after it seemed to be impossible to find the ""Fountain of Youth"", the other mythical discovery. This legend was screaming to be a fantasy film. In the Dreamworks interpretation of this legend, we follow the misadventures of two con-artists (voiced by Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline) who accidentally win a treasure map in a craps game. When the game goes sour, the cons hide out in some barrels and end up on a boat bound for the New World. To their bad luck the boat happens to be captained by the most famous of the Spanish conquistadors, Cortez. Thrown in the depths of the ship by Cortez, our two heroes plan their escape. Without spoiling anymore of the film, the two end up in the New World to follow their map. The Dreamworks animators deliver lush rich scenery and delightful characters. These characters and scenery were a lot like the brilliance found in Disney's ""Jungle Book"" and last year's amazing ""Tarzan"". If you remember back to ""Prince of Egypt"" we had that magnificent look and the celebrity voices but no real memorable relationships. The intricate relationships between the characters in this film is one more step ahead forward Dreamworks. But what the film lacked was a real memorable song. The team of Elton John and Tim Rice, who dreamed up the brilliant soundtrack of the ""Lion King"", really never deliver a solid song that your kids will be singing weeks after the film. The songs here really have no heart but instead just play during some of the weaker scenes of the film. Now all they have to do is deliver musical songs and a musical score we will want to listen to after the film closes. Disney still reins supreme as head animation studio. But watch out Mickey, Dreamworks is one step behind. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",2000
7,"It's not surprising why so many people loved The Road to El Dorado, whether they were a kid or an adult. The Road to El Dorado charms you right in the beginning. Even if you usually hate songs in animated films, the music of this one is amazing. And they don't ruin the dialogue by turning a conversation to a song (Apart from It's Tough to be a god, but that song was so good it didn't even matter). Instead they are planted in scenes where no words are spoken. It works very well, and is a lot better than characters singing.",2015
8,"The Road To El Dorado is a fun film from Dreamworks. Is it the best Dreamworks film? No, I don't think it is as evocative or as stirring as Prince of Egypt, as zany or as (quite) original as Shrek, as witty or as charming as Antz, as ambitious or as mature as Spirit or as audacious or as sweet as Over the Hedge. But is it the worst Dreamworks? No, I was disappointed with Shark Tale, which was nice visually but suffered from a meandering script and an unoriginal plot line, and I think it is better than Shrek the Third, which felt tired in comparison to its first two predecessors.",2010
9,"(In my review of ""Spirit"", I mentioned it was a Disney film. My apologies to Dream Works, as it was their film, not Disney's.) Now, on with the review of ""The Road to El Dorado"" another Dream Works film!",2002
8,"The premise of The Road to El Dorado is nothing new. Two con artists, one a schemer and the other a dreamer, find their way to the ancient city of El Dorado where the locals mistake them for Gods. What sets it apart is if it can take advantage of this premise with enjoyable characters and good jokes, and El Dorado certainly does that. It knows just when to deliver the comedy, capitalise on the films adventurous aspects and when to let the characters breathe.",2015
8,"Some people often try comparing Dreamworks features to that of their biggest competitor Disney. Sometimes those comparisons are worthwhile with the likes of Antz and Bugs Life, but for the most part Dreamworks always create their own style of fun. One of the best films at showing this is Road to El Dorado, with a unique setting and a sense of adventure unlike any put to animation before.",2014
7,"The Road to El Dorado (2000), an animated cult film if there ever was one. It's interesting to compare this flick to Disney's The Emperor's New Groove (2000), which came out the same year. Both are traditionally animated. Both are wickedly funny. Both underperformed at the box office. While Emperor has gone on to be one of the most beloved modern Disney films, El Dorado is still only a cult film. That's a real shame, because it's a fun ride with snappy dialogue and cool characters.",2013
8,"The Road to El Dorado was birthed during the period where Dreamworks was still getting started, per say. After releasing the deeply sophisticated Antz and the cult favorite The Prince of Egypt, moviegoers still really had no true idea of what kind of film the company would give them. If Antz was sophistication, then The Road to El Dorado is anarchy - the coherent and easily-lovable kind. Filled with catchy, spur-of-the-moment songs, bright stylistic animation, and an immersing storyline, it majors in the field of uncompromising fun.",2013
10,Writing a review for this movie is difficult because it's hard to get across how funny it is !! Actors Kevin Kline & Kenneth Branagh (sp?) voiced their characters PERFECTLY! Kline using his hilarious sarcastic overtones wonderfully and Branagh with his hilarious English charm.,2010
9,"I'm a Disney shareholder and a huge Disney fan, yet I'll be the first Disneyphile to admit this Katzenberg-led DreamWorks movie kicks Disney butt. It is fun, well-drawn, and decently-paced.  Elton John's music, though not really kid-friendly, is certainly memorable for adults looking to escape for a few hours.",2003
9,"""The Road to El Dorado"" is a cartoon with plenty in it for adults. Adult cartoons are a relatively unexplored art form. Disney has started towards it with movies like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (a good movie to see if you liked this one), but Dreamworks seems to be the studio to watch. This movie is entertaining, well written, well cast, well produced and my only complaint is that they didn't go just a bit farther and make it a full PG-13. Maybe someday ""animation"" won't automatically mean ""for kids,"" and this is a step in the right direction.",2000
8,"This is the best animated movie (rated PG-13 or lower) since The Lion King. The story seems a bit rushed, but it is entertaining.  And the animation simply breathtaking.  The soundtrack is another winner for Elton John and the songs he performs add depth to the story.",2000
7,"The movie rating is PG, and with good reason. Kids won't get many of the jokes, as they are of a more mature nature than those found in Lion King. The soundtrack isn't quiet as strong as Lion King either, but then Phil Collins won the Oscar for the song from Tarzan, so Elton may well have a shot again...",2000
10,"Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines Minnie as a 'sister' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with James Belushi as her husband.  Classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.",2001
9,"I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. Isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?",2005
8,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I said out loud to no one in particular ""this film is going to bomb.""  I also said that about THE MATRIX and look at what happened there.  Now I am not a box office guru by any stretch but I usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck.  In this case I was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards David Duchovney.  Let me put it to you a different way:  I don't like his as a person ( from what I have read of him in interviews, he is unbelievably pre-madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is X-Files ) or as an actor.  PLAYING GOD was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen.  But I am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man, Return To Me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place.  Bonnie Hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace.  This is one of the most romantic films I have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise, give it a chance and you will be hooked.",2000
10,"I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!",2003
10,"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night.  We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was.  David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow ""transplant"" donee.  I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever.  Everyone in the movie theater was laughing and enjoying themselves.  Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!",2000
10,I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.,2004
10,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,2005
10,"I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this...ever! My favorite part is when Grace(Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, ""WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?"" I do believe everyone(No matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile. But while it's very sappy, it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all.(Sigh)",2004

8,RETURN TO ME / (2000) ***1/2,2000
8,"""Return to Me"" is a fine example of quality films that Hollywood can still produce for the whole family. The cast is excellent and includes top old-time actors, stars from intermediate years and newer actors. Carroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia head a quartet of old-time buddies that close O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant each night. O'Connor is Marty O'Reilly, the owner. Loggia is his friend and famous Italian chef, Angelo Pardipillo. James Belushi and Bonnie Hunt are Joe and Megan Dayton. They are family friends of Grace Briggs, played by Minnie Driver. Grace is Marty's granddaughter. She has an inherited heart problem. Across town (Chicago), David Duchovny is a builder, Bob Rueland. He's married to Dr. Elizabeth Rueland, a zoologist at the city zoo. David Grier is Charlie Johnson, a veterinarian at the zoo. He heads a list of friends of Elizabeth and Bob. ",2014
10,"This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink ""I Never Got to Say Goodbye"", is the song come to life. You will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing. It would be nice to cuddle up with your ""honey""; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. There is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expression is available all the way through. In fact, at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours. See it!",2005
8,"This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after.  Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family (a rarity in film today), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD.  David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes. I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing. I am really thankful to the creators of this film. They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film. I will watch this time and time again for years to come.  Return to Me reminds me that there are still moviemakers out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences. Thanks!!",2002
10,"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it?",2001
6,"While not a big budget blockbuster, ""Return To Me"" pushes all the right buttons for those who enjoy this overworked genre. The film offers an interesting premise; doesn't take itself too seriously; showcases some okay acting talent; and serves up some refreshing creativity. More than your trite chick flick, those who just go with it will likely chuckle and weep. Home is where the heart is.",2000
9,"A delightful and wonderful film, which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies. IN many ways it's even better than ""When Harry met Sally."" IT wears well on viewing and re-viewing. The cast is excellent, and both David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give us really believable characters.",2002
6,"THE GOOD - A deep cast and no villains make this romantic comedy a nice movie. David Duchovny does a nice job in a low-key role. I've read in several reviews (not here) that James Belushi stole the movie with his supporting role but I thought if anyone did that it was Carroll O'Connor, not Belushi. O'Connor is just great as the kind, Godly Irish grandfather. He and all the older people, actually, are fun to watch in their matchmaking roles.",2006
8,"My parents frequently state that there are no romantic comedies as good as the ones made when they were young.  Hah!  Here's one, which is a tremendous credit to the entire cast and crew.",2000

Meanwhile, sickly Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver) is in the hospital and she gets transplanted with Elizabeth's heart. About one year later, Grace is still self-conscious about the heart transplant. Her family (Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia) runs an Irish-Italian restaurant. Bob is heart broken and his best friend Charlie (David Alan Grier) keeps trying to set him up. Sparks fly when Grace meets Bob at the restaurant but they don't know their other connection.",2014
10,"This is about as perfect a romantic comedy as one could ever hope to see. It's the kind of romantic film that Hollywood has simply forgotten how to make. Thank heavens Bonnie Hunt still remembers how. Her gift for storytelling shines brightly in her big screen directorial debut, which she co-wrote with her long-time collaborator, Don Lake. Splendid cast, wonderful story, and genuine performances. In the hands of a lesser director this could have gone into treacly territory. But Miss Hunt has hit all the right buttons, using the experience she gained from Second City and producing and directing her own TV shows, and her own innate sense of what works and what doesn't, to craft a tale worth watching again and again. For a first-time movie director, Bonnie Hunt, you did better than good.",2010
10,"Somehow this movie has made it onto our ""watch it again and again"" list. Even though we know exactly what's going to happen, it's a sweet story, well told, well written, well casted, well acted. It's got everything if you like ""romatic comedies"" or ""romantic drama."" ",2009
9,especially considering I can count on one hand the romantic comedy films I have ever enjoyed.,2006
9,"I originally saw this movie because it stars Brendan Fraser, an actor who can't seem to make a bad movie, and often makes great movies, such as ""Blast From the Past"".",2006
9,"No, this isn't the best or funniest comedy in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it.  There is a fair amount of really good comedy in the film to keep you entertained.  ...And of course there's Elizabeth Hurley...need I say more?",2003
7,"""Bedazzled"" tells of a tech support geek (need I say more?) who sells his soul to the devil (Hurley) for seven wishes which he attempts to use to get close to a girl at work (O'Connor). The flick is a situational comedy which takes the audience on a fun ride as Fraser's wishes turn him into one exaggerated comic-book-type caricature after another. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, ""Bedazzled"" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. A fun watch with a cute ending, lots of eye candy for the guys, and Fraser doing what he does best playing a big, naive, smiling guy.",2001
8,"Here's a fun film with a number of good laughs. It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!",2007
10,"Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes. His remake of this 1967 classic rides on the slumped shoulders of Elliot (Brendan Fraser at his best), a pathetically geeky loner who is so socially unskilled that he makes our skin crawl a little. When we first meet him, Elliot is trying to glom onto his co-workers' after-hours social scene by using such tried-and-true means as showing photos of his speakers (from all sides), a truly awful blue-eyed soul brother act, and plain old stalking.",2001
7,"The makers of Bedazzled were not out to make a classic comedy,they were simply trying to make us laugh.Their mission was a successful one.Bedazzled is full of laughs and great character acting by Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Connor.After many forgettable roles in several forgettable films,Brendan Fraser has really graduated into one of cinemas' big time players in just the last couple of years.As I said,Bedazzled will probably not go down as a comedy classic,it's just your basic comedy filled with laughs from start to finish,and that's good enough for me.It would be a worthy addition to the comedy section of anyone's home library.Thumbs up!",2001
9,Even though Elizabeth Hurley plays The Devil she is a goddess.,2000
8,"I wasn't expecting too much when I rented this movie. In fact, I thought I'd probably end up turning it off after a half hour, as it looked in the trailer like it would be one of those silly, go for the gag-laughs Hollywood pieces of junk. What a surprise! This was an excellent, entertaining film that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's basically a love story, but far from a ""chick flick""(yeah, I'm a guy), it's a clever one that is well written, has a number of different subplots that are interesting to see played out, and deftly mixes comic overtones with a touching character study. I wasn't a particular fan of Brendan Fraser till now, but I was blown away by the way he perfectly captured the number of different personalities portrayed in the movie. Even the technical aspects of the movie are impressive: in one scenario the special effects wizards make Fraser into a 7'6'' pro basketball player that is totally convincing.",2001
8,"I have loved the original so much over the years, I did not have much hope for this version. But I was pleasantly surprised. Harold Ramis wrote a new script based on the concept of the original movie, and he did a good job. Elizabeth Hurley plays a gleeful devil and amply fills out every outfit she wears; but Brendan Fraser steals the show. His acting and characterizations were outstanding. Lots of fun.",2000
8,My husband and I saw this movie a couple days early as part of promo through a local TV and radio station.  This is a VERY good movie.  Brendon Frasier is a truly brilliant actor.  His flexibility is truly showcased in this movie because of the variety of situations that come up.  There were many times when I laughed out loud.,2000
10,"This film was very entertaining and lots of laughs, and you can hardly be critical of a film which is meant to be UNBELIVEABLE!!! Stories about the devil and the wishes he or she grants is always an eye catcher, the struggle between Good & Evil.  Elizabeth Hurley (The Devil),""Bad Boy"",'02 was very sexy as a devil and almost kept Brendon Fraser(Elliot Richards),""Monkey Bone"",'01 from meeting his true love Francis O'Connor,(Alison Gardner),""Book of Love"",'04. Elliot truly loved Alison and even told the devil,""I JUST WANT ALISON TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE"", which made The Devil quite mad.   If you just want to enjoy a film and be entertained, don't miss this crazy comedy!",2004
6,"Elliot Richardson is not the most dynamic of protagonists; he is the sort of guy who tries too hard to be popular making him more annoying than likable and the woman he loves, co-worker Alison, is barely aware that he exists. Then one day he says he'd do anything if she would like him the next thing he knows a stunning woman, who claims to be the Devil, offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He doesn't take much persuasion. Unfortunately while his wishes are granted they aren't quite granted how he'd hoped; for example he wants to be rich, powerful and married to Alison he becomes a drug lord, she is having an affair and hates him. The other wishes are similarly disastrous and ultimately he realises that perhaps making selfish wishes isn't a good way to get what you want.",2016
5,"A lot of people have criticized this film and not without reason, but I still find it pretty fun with some really very funny parts. It certainly is better than many of Fraser's other comedies, but can't hold a candle to Blast from the Past.",2005
6,"A remake of the 1967 Classic with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. Replaced with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley respectively this version fails to be as clever or as sinister as the original, but it still entertains and Elizabeth Hurley is the sexiest devil you'll ever see.",2006
7,"This is one of my favorite recent (I must be getting old) comedies. Having recently seen it, I just had to write this short review and applaud this unpretentious but intelligent and funny comedy. Brendan Fraser is funny as always, with so many transformations he does so well, but Elizabeth Hurley steals the show. She never looked better, and never put on such a convincing performance. Really hard to imagine a better devil in a comedy.",2011
7,"In ""Bedazzled"", Brendan Fraser stars as Elliot, a likable loser who tries hard but just doesn't have many friends, and he hopelessly pines for Allison (Frances O'Connor). Then the devil shows up. The devil is Elizabeth Hurley in sexy outfits who, in exchange for his soul, will grant him wishes.",2010
9,"Seductive Elizabeth Hurley as the devil and multi-talented Brendan Fraser as the hapless victim whose soul she demands,  make an unbeatable combination. ""Bedazzled"" is not a remake of ""Faust"" but incorporates many elements of that tale.",2001
8,"There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx.  He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.  Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.",2001
8,"True to the structure, Iñárritu attacks the subject of love with a multi-pronged approach, addressing three different stages, or complications, common in `love.'  All three storylines represent the `struggling' aspect of love.  It would be fair to say that Amores Perros, roughly translated to be `Love's a Bitch,' makes the ultimate statement, `Love is a struggle.' More specifically, however, Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the `hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it.  To be with his love, Susana, he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socio-economic state.  Daniel and Valeria, who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders, represent love's most frustrating peak - when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out, for better of for worse.  Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel, Valeria, a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial.  El Chivo, whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's, represents distance and alienation from love, inwardly looking at it from the outside.  He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man.  It would be difficult to look at these three different `stages' of love in a classically structured film.  The episodic structure eases us between each stage, at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages.  Breaking it up into three different narratives, each revolving around different characters, presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others, a more pervasive perspective.",2004
9,"Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, ""Amores Perros"" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.",2003
9,"Maybe for most of you, people outside third-world countries like Mexico or Colombia, my home, movies like ths one are only representations of another world... something away from you. My city, medellin, is one of the most dangerous cities on the world. Mexico city can be as dangerous as medellin. I`m not talking about politics. maybe you haven`t lived violence as near as i have, but im gonna tell you something, that is the main reason i voted 9 this movie: Amores perros is not fiction. Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensive models that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes, we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we have houses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as you think. Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Yourè seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you",2002
9,"This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.",2003
10,"I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Buñuel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').",2005
9,"Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.",2009
5,"Will someone please tell me what all the fuss is about? If the presence of gore is the gauge of cinematic skill, then yes, AMORES PERROS is a masterpiece. But surely one first-time director's fascination with maimed dogs and Mexicanismo does not a 21st-century film template make. Granted, it's a somewhat cleverly crafted story, but this blood-guts-passion trip through Mexico City fails to make any real point or leave the audience with much to ponder. (Though I did find myself contemplating how they managed to locate all those dead-dog body doubles for the live dogs...)",2001
10,"A masterpiece. Plain and simple. This picture transcends any language and culture, making us all be able to relate to each of its characters. I don't buy the comparison to Pulp Fiction or any other work. The disregard of chronological scene order and intertwining storylines have been occuring in films for years. Its done for effect here, is all.",2003

7,"I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for £8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.",2004
7,"""Amores perros"" is not a bad film by any means.  There were moments where I was genuinely interested in the plot and its message, and direction wise there was a good number of times where the director's and actor's abilities shined brightly.  But there were also flaws that stuck out too strongly for me to strongly recommend this film.",2001
7,"This film consists of three intertwining stories, all involving dogs, and all laced with violence.  The first story we're shown, that of Octavio, is excellent.  Definitely a ""10"".  If the movie had stayed at this level it might have been the best film of the year, but the second segment is annoyingly bad.  Totally ridiculous, bad acting, lame story.  The third and final segment is very good.  I would recommend seeing this film, but I'd also recommend fast forwarding through the second segment.",2002
5,This movie is 'okay'. It didn't blow me out of the seat like a number of other people. I found it one vignette too long and the character development a little over wrought. The friend I went with said that the movie would have been fine after the first couple's story had ended -- but it kept going and going and going...,2001
9,"'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.",2007
7,"Three stories are connected by a horrific car accident in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's feature film debut. All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with ""Bitch"" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis. I more or less preferred them in the order they played out, though even the first story has its flaws (am I really supposed to have much sympathy for a guy who participates in dog fights?).",2015
9,"If like me, you were dazzled by this year's ""Babel"", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to ""Babel"", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel""), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: ""Love's a Bitch""), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like ""Babel"", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.",2007
8,"The director Alejandro González Iñárritu did an extraordinary thriller combining masterfully three different stories where fighting dogs are included, and also using the camera in tricky ways several times probably to increase the excitement. In Mexico there are many ways to earn money for survival in some cases or for lucrative purposes in others. There fights among animals are arranged regularly. In Mexico the so-called Palenques are famous where the people go to see fights between cocks, but also fights of dogs are organized in places less formal than Palenques. In both fights the people bet, some small money but others high sums. The film goes around this issue of fights between dogs, where obviously you have always a persistent dog champion, highly susceptible to be killed by other means in order to take it away. But the film is in fact about the misery of the humans, no matter if they are poor or rich. Amores Perros is an exceptional film, and a sample of the quality of several new-era films in Latin America, which may compete easily in their plots and depth with other films made in Europe and USA.",2005
5,"Well, I was really excited about seeing this one: stunning debut, the Mexican Pulp Fuction...",2001
4,"Amores Perros is pretty good stylistic film - got all the 'modern' elements e.g. color filters, camera techniques, quick wit gangster talk, disjoint time lines, etc. I'm happy that this is a breakthrough Mexican film, I even praise the thoughtfulness in integrating the modern film techniques with the culture. Well done. I just hoped to see more new styles created by Mexican film industry, in a way that isn't subordinate to American or European film fashions - something even newer and more extraordinary so to make Hollywood/Europeans be the copycat for few decades would be wonderful to see :)",2002
8,"Greg Berlanti's film is worthy of a lot of praise in a society where gay men tend to only fulfill certain stereotypes. A character, Howie mentions how he would like to see gay men being represented as something other than the woman's best friend, the hustler, the aids victim or the sex addict and this film does tend to try hard to avoid these stereotypes. The script is brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. At its worst, it may be a little bit cliche ridden but hey..it also has originality ( I have taken ""Meanwhile"" and now its commonplace down ere!) and is not afraid to portray gay men as just a group of lads who are falling in and out of relationships, liek any other group of young men. However certain characters do tend to bring the pace down a little and it does sometimes seem to have the sentiment that gay men have got it so bad compared to everyone else in the world. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up primarily of TV actors. My only grumble was the inclusion of the lesbian couple who seemed to only be there to represent the ladies and also to give Howie a meatier role. 4/5",2004
9,"I know people have their problems with this movie, but I happened to catch it at the perfect time in my life. I think every young gay male should watch this movie and see that there is life after coming out. It's nice to see a gay movie that isn't a GAY movie. The main characters all happen to be gay, but that is not the focal point of the movie. There is no sub-plots about AIDS or dealing with same-sex marriages or disapproving parents. The movie starts when all that stuff has already happened. It really makes you think. Two thumbs up! The cast is superb. Although not superstars, the movie has some well seasoned actors; including Fraiser star John Mahoney. Zach Braff does an excellent job as does Andrew Keegan, Dean Caine and of course Timothy Olyphant. Kerr Smith also has a small cameo but well worth it. This movie begins to break down the stereotypes of gay men and comes up with some great gay lingo that my friends and I have adopted.",2006
9,The day I was finally able to admit to myself that I was a gay man I rented this movie. That first viewing changed my life. It helped me envision a life a hoped was ahead of me. During my first year of being out I watched this movie so many times and still watch it about once a year.,2005
8,"How un-promising does a gay male Sex In The City sound? This one took me quite by surprise. It's a frequently very funny romantic comedy, that only occasionally dips into cliche. Why America remade Queer As Folk when they already had this is beyond me. Is ""Queer as folk"" ever an expression over there? Anyway, this includes Frasier's Dad and Superman amongst its gay baseball team, so it's good in my book.",2004
8,"As a mature (61) gay man, I enjoyed the hell out of this film. At least there was a diversity of stereotypes. I guess it would be boring to show that most gays lead ""regular"" lives in all kinds of workplaces. The angst was, thankfully, less ""Dawson's Creek"" and more universal. The experienced straight actors helped it flow along nicely, a cut above the usual sloppy, Indie-style gay movie. The Lesbian subplot should have been expanded--or left out! I recommend this movie to all young lesbians and gays facing a still altogether ignorant homophobic society---but one that has improved since I was their age. Kudos to the people behind the camera too!",2006
10,"The Broken Hearts Club is one of the most genius films I have ever seen. I love the way each character is conveyed differently, proving the homosexual male stereotype wrong. This movie is very warm and heart-felt bringing a connection to the viewer and the characters.This film is smart, and a well put together comedy that will definitely have viewers laughing, crying, smiling, fussing, and cheering until the very end. I recommend everyone have an open-mind and see this film. There are few films that I would say won my heart after seeing it but The Broken Hearts Club did just that. This film shows that homosexual males go through many similar situations that heterosexual males also go through . This movie sends many different positive messages to it's audience. I definitely respect this film 100 percent. The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comdey deserves a standing ovation.",2005
6,THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB: A ROMANTIC COMEDY (2000),2005
7,"I enjoyed ""Broken Hearts Club"" primarily because it was good nostalgia about coming out as gay, making friends, etc. Its feel-good elements are reminiscent of ""Queer as Folk"" and ""Love, Valour, Compassion"" (though less heavy than the latter.) The lead character of Dennis, played by Timothy Olyphant and the character Kevin (played by Andrew Keegan) were the most interesting, as they seemed the easiest to relate to. Other characters (and the relationship challenges they deal with) were interesting as well. Some of the humor and content are a bit cliché and the film is occasionally melodramatic. Overall, however, it is a feel good movie and I would recommend it to gay audiences.",2005
10,"I've no idea how many of the actors in ""The Broken Hearts Club"" are actually gay.  From what I can determine, not many, yet they all turn in very convincing performances.  Essentially an ensemble pic along the lines of ""The Big Chill"" we get a look inside the lives and loves of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood.  Not as raw as ""Queer As Folk"" or as tame as ""Will & Grace"" this movie is your basic young people in angst as featured weekly on FOX, UPN  and the WB, the only difference being these young people (and a wonderful older John Mahoney) are gay. The ""R"" rating for language, drug use and sexual situations (which are only suggested) almost seems a bit of overreaction. As one of the few gay themed films NOT dealing with AIDS this is the perfect gay ""feel good"" flick and for a wild juxtaposition try it as a double feature with ""The Boys In The Band""",2004
9,"OK, so the movie may p**s a bunch of people off because of the subject (GAY) or because it looks like a bunch of hotties that just want to mess around (isn't that what all gay people do?) My offering is, isn't that what most people do, gay, straight, or bi? The film works because the characters are real, the druggie, the pretty boy who sleeps with everything and anyone, the one who has the wonderful marriage to the guy who is screwing around. Don't we know people like this all the time?",2004
7,"We watched this film when it first was released. On second viewing, thanks to the IFC channel, ""The Broken Hearts Club"" looks a bit dated since more daring films and television series have come out of the closet recently. It must have been a courageous undertaking by its director, Greg Berlanti, in 2000, at a time that gays were not as prominent as now. The director shows a positive side of the gay life that is not seen often, in that all the characters have values and integrity, something not often seen in mainstream films.",2005
2,"A group of fickle, flighty gay men talk about their non-existent love lives while roaming the streets of Hollywood, CA. Aside from John Mahoney (as the only responsible adult in the bunch), the characters are jaded twenty-somethings who all speak in the same bitchy idiom. Their love lives are ""non-existent"" simply to skirt the still-controversial issue of showing two men in bed together. The film doesn't have the courage of its convictions and, though some of the one-liners might provoke a stray chuckle or two, the loosely-hinged plot isn't absorbing. This, coupled with a low-budget and an uncharismatic cast, makes ""Broken Hearts"" a chore to get through. * from ****",2002
8,"A good drama films, except being enjoyable and entertaining, supposedly should have `things' to offer to it viewers. The story must be meaningful and make us think about the subject matter.

Where was the character development?  Think of the most boring plotlines from the most boring daytime television sitcom, then remove the women.  That is what this movie is about.  The only reason I watched it till the end was to see if anything even remotely interesting happened, or if maybe there were even some non-laughable acting performances.  Guess not.",2002

If you think all the good men are gay, you're absolutely right! And if Timothy Olyphant's performances in average films such as `Scream 2' and `Go' caught your interest, run to the video store for this movie. Free from the burden of playing weird, intense psychos, Olyphant finally gets a starring role as a normal guy, and he does a wonderful job of making the character true to life. The subtle change in his body language was mesmerizing. He left me wanting more. A great film about love and friendship.",2001

Sure, there's more than a couple stereotypes (yes, all gay people are pretty well to do and wear fabulous clothes); yet there are some enjoyable stories and points pondered herein. I didn't buy Dean Cain's role, and personally, I thought the character got in the way. I did understand what I felt the writers message was, that being actors and actresses still clinging tight to their closets in ""mythologically liberal"" Hollywood. I felt the issue could have been explored better, or to make it a more integral part of the story. It was left in a symbolic limbo, of sorts. ",2001

And that's basically the problem with this movie - it's about being gay, being gay, being gay... and not much else. I suspect however that it will ultimately find a place in the history of queer cinema as an example of the ""homosexuality is good/healthy"" period, as contrasted with all the gay stereotypes in movies up to the late 90's. It will also form a sharp contrast with subsequent cinema, in which the banalization of homosexuality returns the focus to drama (where it should be) not sexual orientation per se.",2007

9,"Ben Kingsley's portrayal of gangster Don Logan is destined to go down as one of the most memorable mobsters in filmdom; up there with the best from Robinson, Bogart, Cagney, Raft, deNiro, Pacino et al. Kingsley's all that good and more.  And the other actors, in their portrayals of fellow gangsters and their lovers, are also excellent.  The story is simple. Gal (Ray Winstone) is a retired English gangster living a life of leisure at his Spanish villa. Then one day his idyll is shattered by a visit from Don Logan, an old protégé, and man to be feared. Logan's intent is to lure Gal out of retirement for 'one last job'. Gal wants nothing to do with it, and the first half of the movie is a battle of wits between the two men. The second half of the film deals with the heist and its aftermath.  The crime is downplayed in the movie which is primarily a psychological exploration of these gangsters; their personal demons, and the relationships amongst themselves. They are indeed scary people, no sympathetic characters here.",2002

8,"To put it simply:  I love this movie!  I've really been looking forward to this movie, mostly because of Kingsley's acclaimed performance.  And he is indeed brilliant in the role of the brash, uninhibited, shamelessly ruthless Don Logan--a role that should go down in history.  I haven't seen Jim Broadbent's performance in ""Iris,"" so I can't technically say if Kingsley deserved the Oscar over him, but I'm glad he got nominated, because it would be an abomination if he didn't.  Kingsley is absolutely terrifying, not showing a bit of remorse.  And it's a real joy to see the man who's famous for playing the well-known pacifist Gandhi take on a role which requires him to spout the ""f"" word 500 times in one whole minute.  OK, I may have been exaggerating there, but believe me...there are scenes in this movie that make ""Pulp Fiction"" look like a G-rated Disney feature.  Let's just say I've never heard the ""f"" word used so many times, at such a lightning-fast pace. Kingsley has some memorable moments, including one where he gets in trouble for smoking on a plane, and cops an alibi involving the male flight attendants sexually abusing him.  As cruel as he is, I found myself laughing hysterically at Don.  As Kingsley said himself, Don is the type of character who says the kind of things that are on most people's minds, but they're too afraid to let it out.    ",2002
10,"At first, I thought this was just a poor man's ""Snatch,"" with the wild cinematography, dark humor, brutal characters and language....but not as good as that more well-known film. Well, I have really begun to like this film a lot, equally, if not more, than ""Snatch.""",2006
9,"A fantastic British gangster movie that goes for authenticity over 'Mockney' laughs. Continuing where 'Performance' left off (it even features James Fox) this movie has stand-out performances from all of it's cast, with Ben Kingsley (as Don Logan) producing the scariest bad-guy in cinema since Dennis Hopper's 'Frank'. Ray Winstone & Amanda Redmond are perfectly cast, with Winstone flinching superbly from the terrifying aggression exuded by Kingsley and, to a lesser extent, McShane. Ian McShane does a lot to bury his lightweight 'Lovejoy' persona with an excellent, menacing performance that contrasts well against Winstone's thin bravado, but the honours here have to go to Kingsley who is simply stunning, turning in a masterclass performance and proving (once again) that he is a top-drawer actor with every aspect of his character (posture; accent; attitude) finally honed and utterly (appallingly) convincing.",2002
10,"I just don't know why this movie didn't get a large release in America despite Kingsley being up for yet another very justified Oscar. It manages to be tense, funny, and totally absorbing all at the same time. The story is told at breakneck speed and never lets up for a second. All the performances are incredible, most notably Ray Winstone, Amanda Redman and Lovejoy himself, Ian McShane, but as everyone points out, Kingsley just steals the show even when he is not onscreen. If this movie doesn't get a major big screen release in the States, it will be a crime larger than any job that Don Logan or Teddy Bass could plan.",2002
8,"I liken this masterpiece to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' for two reasons. One is the similarity they share in that you're not sure it's OK to be laughing at the content and secondly each film is in two halves, changing pace slightly after the main characters die. Glazer has managed to add a touch of class though that Kubrick didn't. The second half of Sexy Beast is still charging and the flashbacks of Don dying keep the viewers pulse pumping. Ben Kingsley was born to play this role. He was robbed of the Oscar. Try watching Ghandi and this back to back, then you'll see what a great actor is. One of the best of all time. Ray Winstone is also perfect and the two of them together compliment each other nicely like a kind of steroid and sun induced Odd Couple. Don Logan is absolutely frightening which I'd be able to notice more if I wasn't huddled over laughing so much every time I watch it. The scene in the kitchen with Gal in his dressing gown and Don firing into him looks like a very upset football coach voicing his disappointment in his star player. It's so impressive the actors don't look like they're acting and the fear on everyone but Don's face says this. Glazer's direction is stunning as is the soundtrack and production. This film is a masterpiece. Anybody who doesn't see that can go back to watching My Three Sons and listening to Neil Diamond ya ponce.",2006
8,"Action, black comedy and violence all figure prominently in this tense crime drama that illustrates brilliantly how a combination of stylish presentation, good pacing and interesting characters can elevate a hackneyed plot into something special. Its story about an ex-criminal getting involved in ""one last job"" is told with great economy, quirkiness and realism and the dialogue (although heavily laden with profanities) is sharp, punchy and witty throughout.",2016
9,"On the surface it's an artful depiction of British gangsters, but the real story is of a man absolutely driven by an obsession with a woman that he's too socially maladjusted to pursue normally. On the surface he's a strong, hyper-masculine man who is pushy, demanding, intimidating and fearless. Beneath the surface he's lonely, isolated, fragile and desperately craves acceptance, especially from the woman he's obsessed with, and he's frustrated and confused by his inability to achieve that acceptance. The casting is perfect. The acting is outstanding. As an American though, I practically needed a translator to understand what they were saying with their thick British accents. I loved the movie. The only flaw I saw was in the death scene. It wasn't believable. The man didn't seem to be experiencing the kind of pain and blood loss weakness an injury like that would've caused. But believe me, it's a minor flaw. It's a beautiful movie.",2007

Ben Kingsley co-stars as Logan. His devious & energized performance make him the `king' of all villains that I have seen in film this year. Kingsley's performance was definitely oscar worthy. Logan is the scowling criminal who effortlessly tries to recruit a retired ex-thief in executing another score. Ray Winstone stars as the ex- bank robber. However, it was Kingsley who stole this show! The film does get a bit uneasy at times, and its beast representation definitely was not one of beauty.

I played it a few times to watch it,it was fantastic,the only other person i've seen do that is jack nicholson in as good as it gets. I'd say it's got to be down to the directing.

It's impregnable. That is the challenge faced by Kingsley who steals the show with his brutal portrayal of Don Logan. His character is not easily forgotten as he plays a character genuinely abusive to his former confederates. The men he seeks for the job includes Ray Winstone who plays Gary Dove a retired thief now living in seclusion with his wife and son. Ian McShane plays Teddy Bass. a man who says more with his stoic facial expressions, than with his voice. The pace of the film is deceiving as is Winstone who glides through his role as quiet as an approaching storm. The film is subtle like an express train and ends with an event one would expect of a train wreck. Great Movie. ****",2009

5,"Ever since the original Halloween was released in 1978, there have been countless imitation films that desperately, although primarily unsuccessfully, attempt to feed off of the success of that film by copying its premise of a faceless and unstoppable killer. In the late 90s, there have been a resurgence of these films, such as the Scream movies, which started off good and then went sharply downhill with each additional sequel, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer (as well as, God willing, it's only sequel, I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago). Hollow Man is a film that takes a fantastic premise and reduces it to yet another of these cheap imitation slasher films. ",2002
6,"This could, and should, have been an interesting look on the idea of invisibility. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, they ran out of ideas and decided to just kill everyone off and have it end in huge explosions, demonstrating a total lack of creativity. Too bad. It could have been great, were it not for the total lack of good acting, the one-dimensional characters, the corny lines and the general lack of anything worthwhile in the movie at all, other than good special effects. I feel bad for Paul Verhoeven; he used to make great movies; RoboCop, Basic Instinct & Starship Troopers were all way better than this mainstream garbage. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, and, believe me, they are good. They are just not good enough to distract the viewer from all the negative points about the movie. It's really too bad that they couldn't make a better movie about invisibility; we've never had a truly good movie dealing with the rush of power it would be to be invisible. This movie tries, but it just falls short. All those great special effects, and no good movie to back them up. I'd only recommend this to special effect nerds, people who'll watch a movie regardless of quality just to see good special effects. I can't imagine anyone else actually enjoying this movie. I gave it a 6/10, but only because of the special effects.",2004
6,"Hollow Man boasts some pretty impressive visual effects and does have an intriguing story. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastion Caine, an arrogant scientist who develops a serum for invisibility. Withholding information from his superiors, Caine tests his serum on himself and undergoes a transformation that is quite visually arresting.  It's like an anatomy book come to life.   But while Caine's transformation and subsequent experiments with his new found power prove interesting, the movie fails to capture what it feels like to truly be invisible.  Caine says to his colleagues, ""You have know idea how much fun this is.""   In truth, we don't. We see Caine slowly going mad and trapping his fellow scientists in the lab when they threaten to go public.  But, we don't get any sense of power from Caine.  True he does venture out into public and enters the apartment of his very fetching neighbor, but that's about all the real world we see with Caine. It would've been interesting to see Caine in the real world, and what would've been done to capture him.  Instead, we have Bacon, Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin and a few others mixing it up in a hidden lab somewhere in D.C.  While the actors try to make the best with what they have, Paul Verhoeven tries to goose us a little.  He succeeds in a few instances, and he does manage to hold your attention for a while, but the ending is the weakest link in the movie.  Had there been a stronger ending, the movie would've been a little better.  As it is now, it's a good exercise in visual effects territory, but there are so many other possibilities that lay with the story of an invisible human being.",2000
6,"Hollow Man has the most basic of plots, a team of scientists are working on a formula to make living beings invisible, the leader of the team decide to try it out on himself, he goes mad and people die; it's as simple as that.",2007
5,"""Hollow Man"" has enough strong performances, nice moments, and interesting plot turns to make for an mildly enjoyable film, as long as you don't think too hard about the plot. Visually, it is quite appealing and effective, and the soundtrack (especially the opening themes played over some effective and atmospheric opening credits) does a great job of adding some ""oomph"" to the action of screen. Keven Bacon is his usual on-screen self, and carries the film effectively, which is no small feat when consider that half the time he is either invisible or covered up in latex, which deprives him of most of an actor's most effective tools (his eyes and his mouth).In the scenes where he is covered in bandages, he has to get the character's emotions and presence out with body language and vocal cues, and even this is filtered through SFX. So I give him kudos for a professional, effective job in a difficult environment. ",2005
6,"""Hollow Man"" seems to improve on second viewing. Yes, it is formulaic. Yes, it is cheesy but for all that it is unabashedly entertaining. On its release it was quite a disappointment considering the talent involved. On reappraisal this film is far better than any action movie delivered by Hollywood since September 11th 2001.",2007
8,"It seems a lot of IMDB comments on this film are biased, in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version. True, ""HOLLOW MAN"" is a remake of sorts of ""THE INVISIBLE MAN"", but that's where the similarities end. ""HOLLOW MAN"" is an entertaining movie,period. If you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place. True, some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable, but ""HOLLOW MAN"" manages to entertain and make you think what YOU would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends. Kevin Bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who, along with a team of collaborators, discover the way to make animals invisible. Now his mission is to make them visible again. When this team of young scientists (working, as you might guess, for the Pentagon)think they have the formula for making animals visible again, Kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug. After that, of course, things go wrong, as Kevin Bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask, so his collaborators know where he is. Feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over Kevin's character, and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend AND collaborator (Elisabeth Shue) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team, he finally snaps. The movie then turns into a hybrid of ""ALIEN"" and a slasher flick, but that's not saying it's a bad turn. There are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace. The special effects are top notch (a quality always prevalent in ALL of Paul Verhoeven's films)as we get to see some ""body reconstitution"" sequences never seen on a movie before. If there's anything to complain about, perhaps, is the predictability of the situations herein; by the first hour of the movie you KNOW Kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end. And the ending is a bit abrupt, but despite this, HOLLOW MAN is still worth watching. If you want to know what a TRULY bad movie is, then waste your money on ""FEAR DOT COM"" (With Stephen Dorf) or the even worse THE UNTOLD (or ""Sasquatsh"", with Land Henriksen). Now THAT is ""hollow""! 8* out of 10*!",2004
8,"Hollow Man is a ride, baby. It isn't scary as the ads would have you believe, but I'll be dammed if it isn't one of the most entertaining horror flicks I've seen in a while. In this age of computer generated, digital effects I have a hard time telling good special effects from bad (they all start to look the same after a while), but this one has a few of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen on film. I assume this is one of the most special effect-intensive movies ever attempted (aside form the latest Star Wars), and they do dazzle, so it's a shame the story doesn't quite measure up. It starts to get a little tired in the third act, but what the hell, I was entertained.",2000
2,"The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, ""The Thing That Won't Die."" Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.",2005
7,"Hollow Man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. They test the serum on an already invisible Gorilla & it works perfectly, Caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers Caine wants to be the first invisible human. He manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & Caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. But then again he's invisible right, he can do anything he wants...",2006

8,"In Paul Verhoeven's entertaining take on H. G. Well's The Invisible Man, Kevin Bacon plays scientist Sebastian Caine, who inadvisably tests his top-secret 'invisibility' serum on himself, and becomes a deranged homicidal maniac.

4,"One could wish that an idea as good as the ""invisible man"" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.",2000
10,"I received this film as a gift and really wasn't expecting it to be so great but I was suprised as I began watching it and really got involved. Most science fiction fare of today isn't that good, however while watching, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.  I began thinking that it is about time for a good sci-fi film with so much suspense.  My heart was racing and my brain was running amok with every frame of this film.  I don't know why most people didn't like this movie that much since the acting is good, the script is brilliant, the special effects are great, film editing is outstanding, and you have to admit that the cinematography is beautiful--look at the vivid colors all throughout the film!  The storyline has enough blow-aways and suprises to keep my interest.  Who could ask for anything more?  An excellent film definitely worth seeing!",2001
5,"Oh dear, many people are not going to take kindly to this Verhoevenesque update on the Invisible Man. Verhoeven makes blockbusters, and Hollow Man will be as vilified as his earlier Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, or Total Recall - whilst at the same time raking in the box-office takings. If you accept the genre where plot and dialogue are allowed to be thin, some gratuitous nudity can be woven seamlessly as one of the 'success' ingredients of the popular movie, and the stars cavort with explosions and optically-challenging special effects, then you can sit back and enjoy this sci-fi horror flick without feeling guilty. On that level, I thought it was superb. Elizabeth Shue and Kevin Bacon give energy-packed (if ""hollow"") performances and the scary bits made me jump enough times to make me feel I'd got my money's worth. Hollow Man often appeals to the lowest common denominator in audiences but if you don't think that prohibits it from being good entertainment, go out and enjoy it!",2000
3,"Leave it to Paul ""sex on the brain"" Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he'd direct a Pokemon film, I'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts. I don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but frankly, it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women. ",2005

How one could direct or even worse, write this movie is beyond me. This movie had many bad components but the script was the ultimate worse. I felt very compelled to write a review for this movie like never before because I do not want others to suffer the same pain I and everyone around me did.  But I am surprised, no I am shocked that some people found this movie remotely entertaining, I was insulted.  I was upset that I actually paid to watch this in a movie theater and did not leave when I wanted to. Ok, enough of that, here is the actual review of the movie.",2000

So I figured all the funny jokes had been given away already. I was wrong. This movie is truly entertaining and hilarious. I don't remember having such a great time at the movies in quite a while, even if some people think it is predictable, but... isn't that the reason most of us go to movies anyway? To spend a good time, have a good laugh and hopefully forget some of our everyday worries? Well this film did it for me. Congratulations to Miss Bullock, she did great job both as producer and as a leading lady, and the supporting cast was amazing. 10/10",2001

Even taking into account that it was 10 years ago when this Rom-Com was released, and most Rom-Coms are forgotten throughout the sands of time by plenty of people for how many there are and how unremarkable most of them manage to be, this one has always managed to stick with me and uphold an excellent reputation, in my eyes, for how wonderful and fun it really is, and is truly one of my favorite movies in general.",2008
6,"It's over-the-top, it's occasionally offensive--to men, to women, to gays, to lesbians, and to poor Miss Hawaii--but ""Miss Congeniality"" has Sandra Bullock, and she's wonderful. The opening moments, with FBI agent Bullock busting Russians in a restaurant sting operation, are so good that the movie might've played very well as an FBI comedy-drama, with Bullock on different cases. I mean, maybe they should've ditched the pageant stuff, at least until next time. But, no, Bullock goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss U.S. pageant, and the movie turns into your typical makeover thing. Lots of breast jokes, TOO many high heel pratfalls, and Michael Caine as a peculiar makeover artist (he's ""dripping with disdain"" one minute, fatherly the next, then bitter, then cuddly). Bullock has no chemistry with Benjamin Bratt as her boss on the operation (that's not her fault, however) and I wanted more of her home life (and that doomed microwave oven), but what works does work well. Sandra's ""bonding"" paint party with the girls is terrific, as is her friendship with shaky Miss Rhode Island and her attempts to face down snarling Ernie Hudson as the FBI chieftain (who, like in ""Ghostbusters"", gets no funny lines). The movie rests solely on Bullock's shoulders, and she delivers. It may not be comic genius, but it is congenial. **1/2 from ****",2001
7,"""Miss Congeniality"" is a fun little comedy with Bullock at the center playing an FBI agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant.

(the painting scene was priceless)Not to mention the original plot that never marred the feel good nature of the film. The performances of Michael Caine and Candice Bergen were excellent.

What made this film so funny, is the three ""Jokers"", and facial expressions. This movie has lots of funny jokes, and clever lines. Mike Epps' character, ""Day-Day"", is probably the most unique character in the film next to ""Joker"". I loved the screenplay for this film, mainly because it had clever lines, and funny jokes. Next Friday also has some pretty good acting, which in general make the movie even funnier. This, I think is, Mike Epps' first film, and I have to say that he did a damn good job for a first film. Like I said earlier in this review, most of the comedy comes from facial expressions, and clever jokes. I would have to say, that the funniest facial expression in this film, was when Mike Epps' character is first introduced. The character ""Joker"", is the funniest part of the film. Every time a joke comes out of his mouth, or any word for that matter, will make you laugh.

Ice Cube plays the humourless lead, which works against the mood of the film. It is as if Cube arrived on the wrong set. Mike Epps plays Cube's best friend who is a complete idiot. John Witherspoon plays Cube's less than friendly father. Perhaps the worst element is an embarrassing appearance by Lister who breaks out of prison and seeks revenge on Cube. Perhaps he should seek out the producers of this film. Tamala Jones plays Epps's pregnant ex-girlfriend although being part of this film gives her something else to be angry about. The conclusion presents theft and drugs as fun as oppose to the endless trouble brought to those who dabbled in it. Nothing of value in this film that prides itself on being stupid. This film should be tossed in a campfire for a marshmallow roast. Score: 1 / 10",2015

7,it was funny but not as funny as the second or third. i like how day-day got that crazy ex. scratching his ride and all. and i love how day-day (mike epps) and Craig (ice cube) fight. this is about Craig knocked out debo in the first Friday. now he's busting out of jail getting some revenge. but Craig's got to move with his sex obsessed uncle and his nasty aunt and cousin. they have great adventures in next Friday. good movie. go buy it rent it kiss it whatever. but really it's good. it was funny but not as funny as the second or third. i like how day-day got that crazy ex. scratching his ride and all. and i love how day-day (mike epps) and Craig (ice cube) fight. this is about Craig knocked out debo in the first Friday. now he's busting out of jail getting some revenge. but Craig's got to move with his sex obsessed uncle and his nasty aunt and cousin. they have great adventures in next Friday. good movie. go buy it rent it kiss it whatever. but really it's good.,2007
9,"I guess this appealed to me because I have a ""ghetto"" side that rarely gets out. Ice Cube turns in a so-so performance, but Mike Epps shines like them ""20s"" he says he keeps clean. The storyline doesn't skip that much of a beat, and the new characters are especially funny (a record store owner comes to mind). The gag jokes are just about non-stop, as the movie plays on just about every stereotype concerning the suburbs ""Friday"" was a great movie, but don't sleep on this just one because it's a sequel.

With that gone you have nothing. I did like the fact it put my hometown of Rancho Cucamonga on the map! There are loads of houses like those up there. Most have crappy non filled swimming pools too....",2003
1,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen! When Chris Tucker said he wasn't going to do it, that should have been a clue, I mean, he made the first Friday.  The first Friday was a classic, not to be messed with, and they put out this awful movie as a sequel.  All I can say is, I'm glad I didn't pay any money to see this in the theater.  I saw it on cable and was still mad, for wasting my time! And now, they have the nerve to make a Friday after next? WHY????",2002
8,"I love stupid movies... I live for them, in fact, and this was definitely stupid.  Spend the $5, go see it for yourself!  If you weren't interested in it, you probably wouldn't be looking at reviews in the first place unless you're a concerned parent (let your kids see it, it's not too bad), or if you hated it and wanted to see if anyone actually enjoyed it.  I did, and I recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh at the antics of two total stoners.  Personally, I think a different ending could have made this movie a lot more enjoyable, but I don't want to give it away, so see it for yourself.  This one won't win any awards (with a name like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" one wouldn't expect it to be a contender, anyway), but for all of us who have had a ""night to remember"" that we forgot, it's damn funny.",2000

But if you see any of them thinking you are going to get an intelligent comedy the problem lies within you and your lack of a sense of humor.",2001

I've never laughed so hard at a movie.  I totally recommend this movie to people who like stupid comedy.",2001
8,"This movie is funny, period. Everyone I know (and like) that saw it thought it was hilarious, including me. I don't understand what people were expecting when they saw this! It was a thousand times funnier than any recent Ben Stiller ""comedy"". There are at least a dozen scenes that made me laugh out loud. The couple of people that actually wrote a good review for this said that it was so stupid that it was funny. Well, I don't think it was any stupider than most of the unfunny ""comedies"" that have come out lately...And a lot of people compared the to ""Bill and Ted"". Why? It was nothing like ""Bill and Ted"", except for maybe there were 2 male leads, like countless other buddy comedies. You people are just... WRONG!",2005
7,"I have to admit it,the plot (2 guys not remembering what they did the night before and ending up in an intergalactic crisis)is every bit as ridiculous as it sounds,but the truth is, for some twisted reason , I like this movie.

10,"A fun, light hearted movie, with moments of comic genius... I like a classic, epic, drama as much as the next guy. But, this wasn't one of those. This was a flick to laugh at. If you are generally a happy person and can laugh or cry at commercials, then you will enjoy the antics and slapstick of this movie. If you are constantly judgmental, moody, or jealous when you see other people having a good time... then this might not make you smile. Did I say smile? That's the idea folks. A film that makes you smile is not going to always get an Oscar. This film is far from Dumb & Dumber, and not close to Neil Simon. Lighten up, loosen up, and cheer up with some popcorn and you will laugh.",2005
8,"Highly entertaining the first 100 times I saw it, now not so much. The 'and then' segment at the drive thru entered my homes dialect and has not left yet. Hot chicks are sprinkled thru the movie, as well as the very disturbing she-male stripper. This movie is often thought of as the epitome of bad, but really it's funny enough. Is it formulaic? Sure. Is Ashton Kutcher a total tool? Kinda looks so. Seann William Scott is the funnier of the two by far. Great cameo appearance of Brent Spiner (knows as DATA on Star Trek Next Generation). The bubble wrap jumpsuits are also highly entertaining and original. I thought there was going to be a sequel to this, but it evidently fell thru.",2006
6,"I saw this under the, ah, recommendation of Dave Barry (""Everything you need to know about America""). It's a typical forgettable, goofy, non-sequitur filled comedy that manages to be on-target the majority of the time. Some *extremely* corny moments (one word: ostriches), but no gaping holes in the plot, and in the end, everything's resolved as reasonably as can be expected.",2006
7,"What a stupid, mindless, cliche'd, juvenile film!",2003
9,"People who saw ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" either loved it or hated it. What you thought of it probably depended on your impression of the movie beforehand. If you're a fan of ""Cheech and Chong""-style stoner movies, and you're a gen-xer or younger, you probably enjoyed it. If you knew it was going to be stupid and expected little, you probably didn't like it.",2005
5,"My 5/10 rating is because, like any Bill & Ted movie, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is only targeted at a certain audience (in this case all the world's slackers). The plot - or whatever it is - of course has goof-ball stoners Jesse Montgomery III (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester Greenburg (Seann William Scott) searching for their car and having a most unusual adventure in the process. The point is that you shouldn't try to take this movie seriously; just accept it as nice stupid fun and you're sure to have a good time. Not a movie that you'll ever forget. If I remember right, Michael Moore even suggested that we should show it to Kim Jong Il in order to make peace between the two Koreas.",2005
6,"Dude Where's My Car wasn't planned to win any Oscars and I didn't expect much of that from this movie. Ashton Kutcher is normally pretty funny on That 70's Show, so I expected a pretty humorous performance by him as well as Seann William Scott who had by this time already been in the first American Pie. All in all I have to say that this movie is definitely very funny and delivers a very nice and event amount of laughter. I wouldn't go out on a limb and call this the greatest comedy ever made and I wouldn't go out on a limb and tell a lot of people to check it out because most people think it is a stupid movie but if you really like a movie with a very dumb plot and lots of laughter, then check this out.",2008

1,"That this film was ever made must seem to its makers somewhat astonishing - to a person who just spent £3 renting it (stupid me) it's an outrage.

I honestly can't believe this got made (or that I allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing).  The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be ""dumb-funny"", and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it.  Oddly enough, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has TOO MUCH plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot.  Of course, they were obviously going for moronic, but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever...There is only one aspect of this film I enjoyed: Donkeylips from the old Nickalodean show ""Salute Your Shorts"" has a very small role. This is the role that will turn him into the next Richard Gere though, you just watch...",2001
1,"Sophomoric humor with a lack of humor.  The plot (what little there was of it) was incredibly thin, and it just seemed to get worse the more I watched. I think Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott are both talented young actors, but in this movie they just looked stupid.",2001
1,"I know there are movies that are ""so stupid they're funny"", but I dont think this one qualifies. I knew that by seeing this I wasnt going to enjoy it, but I have to say I at least expected some funny things to be in it. It was really corny and stupid, nothing humorous about it.

But given that, they can't turn water into wine.  Or in this case feces into dunkin donuts!  This movie sucks so bad that i would pay other people to watch it just to hear how they hated it so much!

Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story may be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.",2005

The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying.

The acting is good without being outstanding but that does not matter because the subject matter and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies i have seen for a long while.

Well, visually speaking, it was ahead of its time, and by today's standards, its imagery has remained unmatched. A film like this would have never been able to get made today, one in which a studio would put millions of dollars into an R rated film that could turn the audience off due to its perverse visuals. Only Tarsem Singh could have created such beauty and disturbing imagery in a directorial debut. But what about the story, you might ask.

It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes.

I couldn't believe how much it made me laugh, I know it's such a dark subject, but it was pretty cool how they just turned into a zanny comedy. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry were just the most perfect choices, they were like ying and yang. Matthew as this guy who just is scared of everything and finally has something at the end to say where he has control and Bruce couldn't have been a more perfect choice as the cocky and yet charismatic hit man who could be threatening but yet the most likable guy in the world.

The jokes are hysterical the first time, but each time you watch it again, they become predicted and give at most an internal chuckle. Matthew Perry does a fantastic job as a character absolutely out of his mind with fear trying to get out of the situation that he has landed himself in. Bruce Willis plays the part of an ex-mafia hit-man decent enough. I don't exactly believe he would be interested in tomatoes, but that doesn't make the punchline of that scenario any less funny.

Is there truly some comedic magic which I failed to recognize in this picture? To make a fair determination let me first count the factors I am sure that I did observe and weigh these in the balance before passing final judgement. First off I'll list the detracting qualities: Contrived slapstick(Perry's manic energy in most places just doesn't feel real), cartoonish TV sitcom acting job from the protagonist,the worst attempt at a foreign accent on screen since ""Robin Hood""(Arquette), and finally to be kind I'll omit several more and leave this as the final negative- the most unlikely romantic pairing seen since ""Heavy""(Perry and Henstridge). Now I'll weigh these against the positives: um, well I honestly can't come up with any. So the verdict is in, quality still doesn't have one bit to do with the success of movies in the United States. What a pity.",2000

The acting was, of course, not the best but there was no need for it to be good; no one was trying to make this story believable. The movie never drags on and is quite entertaining with a few nice laughs. Also, there are no annoyingly repetitive jokes.

Oz is having some people wanting to know what Jimmy is up to and making sure he is staying hidden, including his friend Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan), and he also finds out that Sophie has hired a hit-man to kill him.

Also starring Species' Natasha Henstridge as Cynthia Tudeski, Amanda Peet as Jill St. Claire, Kevin Pollak as Janni Pytor Gogolak and Dumb and Dumber's Harland Williams as Special Agent Steve Hanson.

1,This movie is so so dull.  I hardly ever walk out of a movie in the theatre but this one I had to.   I just cannot believe they are doing a sequel to this thing.   I guess Willis has enough star power to do about anything...even create a franchise out of crap...,2002
10,"The Whole nine yards is a fantastic comedy that goes the whole nine yards. I thought that was a good joke too. It's a clever comedy from director Jonathan Lynn(Who did the fantastic comedy My Cousin Vinney). I didn't quite think this was as good as My Cousin Vinney, but it was still a genius comedy. Bruce Willis is actually very funny as a mobster. But, as we've seen in previous films, Bruce Willis can do anything. The Whole nine yards has tons of fantastic performances by Matthew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan, and an actress who I will never forget. Amanda Peet. Amanda Peet is a great actress and is really funny in tons of her films. I liked The Whole nine yards because it's one of those comedies that you may not see that much of. Something different that just blows your mind. It blew mine. The best performances in the film are from Bruce Willis and Amanda Peet. Though I forgot about Rosanna Arquette, who plays Oz's(Matthew Perry) wife. Who has a French Canadian accent going on. The Whole nine yards is a hilarious and genius film that I will never forget.",2009

I don't know what the competition was that year, but it must have been something out of this world for this movie to be so overlooked.",2006
3,"This is a supreme example of the lazy, unimaginative film-making that has given Hollywood a bad name over the last twenty years. Matthew Perry (he of Friends fame) is Oz, a dentist with a horrible wife (Rosanna Arquette, with a 'comedy' French accent). His world is turned upside down when Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a famous hitman, moves in next door. You see what I mean? It's creaky already. Throw in some tedious plot about gangsters killing each other and the truly unlikely idea of Natasha Henstridge falling for Perry and what emerges is an over-long sub-Sopranos crime comedy-thriller with no thrills and no discernible jokes.",2000
9,"Billy Elliott is a moving, uplifting, and often exuberant, drama about motherless young Billie (Jamie Bell) fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer, in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother (Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven).",2005
10,"I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month, finally, I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie, easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade.",2004
10,"To say that Billy Elliot is the best movie of 2000 is to damn it with faint praise, since this year's crop is pretty uninspiring. Better to compare it to movies of the past few years, and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film, and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way, since it goes against the trend of quirky, violent, sex-obsessed moviemaking that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good, almost mythic story, complicated yet believable characters, a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint, and a series of dance scenes that are authentic, inspiring and completely integral to the plot.",2000
9,"I had seen the commercials and they emphasize the dancing aspect of the story which is great but there is so much more to this movie. It deals with death and it touches on Mens feelings of loss and what a Man is and even deals a bit with homosexuality. Theres not many times where I sit though the end credits anymore but I was mesmorized. I laughed in this movie and I cried too. The dance scenes were terrific too. The boy who played Billy should get an award hands down for this movie. I watched the emotion on his face and it was amazing. This is the best breakout performance by a young boy since haley Joel Osmant in Sixth Sense. I have to say I just loved Julie Walters too. Where has she been since Educating Rita. Inspite of the swear words this is a movie that families should see. Its hard to believe this gets an R rating and movies like Scary Movie get...only R ratings.  I dont get it. Strange that two of my favorite recent movies are from the British...This and Croupier. Word to Hollywood, make more movies like this or at lease import more like this. Dont miss this one!",2001
10,"After revisiting this film again recently, I stick my chest out and state proudly that the film touches me on so many levels that my emotions go all over the shop. For a film that is in essence a feel good coming of age drama it is mightily impressive that the film never veers down that street known as sickly boulevard.",2008
9,"This is one of those really great dramas that only come around maybe once a year. This is my pick for the best drama of 2000. Filled with amazing characters, a great plot, and circumstances that seem too real, the wonderfully underplayed value of it takes precedence over anything set against it.",2000
10,"Billy Elliot is a wonderful story of a young boy overcoming obstacles to participate in the one activity that takes him away from his troubled family life. By dancing, Billy unleashes his frustrations, yet also receives much criticism by participating in a less than macho sport. Every aspect of this movie was well done: the acting was superb, the characters were complex but believable, but the cinematography alone takes the cake. The cameras look at things from some very interesting and unusual views. Every shot was well planned out and every item in the background had importance.",2001
9,"This movie is such a good film for a number of reasons. As a study of daring to be different in the fact of intractable tradition, Billy Elliot is beautiful, touching, poignant and very honest. It does start off slowly, but the film does have a lot of heart. Firstly, I liked the story, a young boy who wishes to ballet dance against the the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike, it was a nice one and is likely to evoke some emotion. Stage director Stephen Daldry makes his feature debut here, and succeeds pretty much brilliantly. Another strong asset was the writing, while funny in places, it is also quite touching. Then the music, I loved hearing the music Tchaikovsky's timeless ballet ""Swan Lake"", such a melancholy yet enchanting and haunting score. But really the best asset of the film is the acting. Jamie Bell gives a really believable performance in the lead role, while Gary Lewis is marvellous as his dad. The acting honours though go to the brilliant Julie Walters as Billy's chain smoking dance instructor, that role especially proves what a fine actress Walters is. In conclusion, I loved this film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",2010
10,"This film came out, when I was younger, I was too young to understand and relate to the movie- I was only 10. Now I am 15, it was on TV last night; I was in aw throughout the whole movie.

9,"What a treat to see on DVD a film which I loved from the second it began with its tacky 70's style music. the boy is so innocent and his family irritated me at first but then i began to really understand what was going on. I thought the only bad thing was the cliché stuff with the people who interviewed Billy. Otherwise, fabulous. If Biritish movie were more like this I would go more to see them when they first come out. I am new to this experience and am trying to see films which are a bit different to the normal Hollywood stuff. I liked the feeling that I was able to recognise the world of Billy - it seemed familiar although I was brought up very conventionally. The photography was special and i absolutely adored the scenes at the end in the theatre. I cried. Lovely film.",2005
8,"Somehow I fell into the trap that this film tackles. Prejudices against ninny ballet dancers. What could be great about an 11 year-old boy from straight British coal miners background who dreams of becoming the new Fred Astaire? But finally the DVD made its way to the player and I must confess I was electricised. The intensity of the acting as well as that of the pictures, the discrepancy between the lost coal miners hopes and the subtle positivism ingrained in the stubborn boy, the subtle humor, all lack of arrogance .... it just all matched. Well told story, straight to the heart without any ""kitsch"" - a pure pleasure to watch and receiving my full recommendation, even though this 2000 flic may not be one the front pages any more.",2005

9,"Dancing, passion and familial struggle are all tied together in the high-spirited ""Billy Elliot,"" the little independent film that could in 2000, when such films were drastically under- appreciated. ""Billy Elliot"" caught some attention however because it combines the dream-like fancy-free spirit of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films along with the social-historical context of the '80s coal miner strike in England. Youthful optimism and social reality are at odds as seen through the young Billy (a very talented Jamie Bell) and the film doesn't let either one completely win out, an admirable and unexpected quality for a story about a child.",2009

I bought this movie on DVD a long ago and watched it just now and I feel i had missed a very good movie. I recommend this movie to every one.Every one who has aim,goal and bad circumstances. Performance of Jamie was excellent he deserved Oscar nod. Inshort its a very well directed movie with a nice subject. Thumbs Up. AS Critic: 85/100 General : 90/100 Every parent should watch it.The movie has unique direction and it deserves TOP 250. Ending could've better thats all my opinion on the whole movie. This is one of the most precious movies of all the time.",2009
10,"Billy Elliot is a heart-warming tale that brings out sadness, anger and laughter captivating the viewer throughout the whole film. There is an obvious musical, comedy and drama theme, as seen in The Full Monty and East is East, this makes it fun to watch and appealing to all ages. The poster used to promote the film is successful in setting the story, targeting all audiences while making it seem interesting. Jamie Bell plays Billy, a fiery, emotional and possibly confused character who is still grieving over the tragic death of his mother. The director, Stephen Daldry, was definitely looking for a 'raw talent' to play this diverse and intriguing young boy; seeing as Jamie had little acting experience and no dancing knowledge, he must have seemed perfect to play the role. All of the actors live up to expectations, especially Julie Walters who comes from the other end of the spectrum, being very popular and with years of experience. She fits into her character's personality instantly because she plays many 'motherly' roles, such as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince and Aunt Betsy Trotwood in David Copperfield. Daldry seems to enjoy producing or directing films in the drama genre, he directed The Reader and another short film Eight, which features the same kind of journey Billy Elliot undertakes; having to cope with the loss of a parent and discovering a new interest that changes their life. As well as this, Billy is constantly in disagreement with his father who deals with his grief in an extremely aggressive way. He is also involved in the miner's strike that severely affected the family's income and interferes with Billy's aspirations. The saddening situations make the viewer sympathise with Billy, and to a certain extent; his family.",2008
10,"What else can be said about this film? I just would like to thank God for letting me watch it. It's one of those films that might be considered ""soul food"". I don't want to talk about all the acting stuff; my only intention is to set my feelings here, and I must be honest: I'm not the same since i watched it. Something has changed inside of me. I wouldn't be able to say exactly what, or how, but my soul has been shaken, and I can see things different, as if ""Billy Elliot"" had opened my eyes. It's very hard for me to put it in words, my intention is to show people that when things are made with all our hearts, they cannot be but rejoicing and delightful. And this film is the best proof of that, fulfilling all the possible expectations. Thank God again (and, of course, thank the cast and all the staff!), and if you haven't watched it yet, your life is incomplete, sure it is!",2001
7,"""Billy Elliot"" isn't about a boy wanting to dance. It isn't about a miners' strike in the mid-1980s. These are only the elements which happen to be chose to tell this story. The story is about finding beauty in the world, finding it despite the chaos and conformity that surrounds youth.",2009

Set again the background/backdrop of working mens struggle to do the only job they have and the gradual acceptance of the family towards the sons ballet classes. This should be compulsory viewing for all those studying English/UK 20th Century social history along with many other gritty Northern England socio-documentary style films such as 'Brassed Off.' The Transporter Bridge at Middlesborough, a piece of wonderful engineering, gets a look in also. The old Newcastle 'National Express' coach station also shown. Such an emotional finale... In my top ten UK films.",2006
9,"Glancing over some of the other reviews of Me, Myself and Irene that crop up on this page, it seems loads of people absolutely hate this movie. If anything, the majority of negative comments appear to be coming from people quick to dismiss it as a dumb piece of un-PC gross out comedy, which is completely missing the point. This is a Farrelly Brothers film with Jim Carrey in the lead role, what were they expecting? Citizen Kane redux? I myself have a masters degree in Film Studies and while I like to sit around, stroking my beard (or failing that, somebody else's), watching Almodovar films and saying ""fascinating"" at regularly timed intervals, I also like to laugh. And Me, Myself and Irene is one of the most gut bustingly funny films I've watched in months.",2007
8,"Back when I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. One day, I was at the video rental place and I decided to rent this because I like most of the Farrely brothers movies, and I also think Jim Carrey is hilarious. What I got was a big surprise, a hilarious movie that looks dumb on the surface, but really makes you laugh out loud.",2005
10,"Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, wish I had seen it much earlier. I thought I had grown tired of Jim Carrey movies. He seemed like the same character in just about every film. True enough, I can still see elements of the same kind of character in this film, but I think the story is a good one. Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy. There were so many funny moments in this movie, from when Jim Carrey nurses on the lovely young mother to the very end when the three boys leave us with ""Thank you for watching our **** movie!"" I actually got all of my friends to watch this movie with me because I was so excited about it and it's already almost 7 years old. Who knew? I guess that just goes to show that you can't judge an actor or a movie until you've seen it.",2007
8,"There is probably no other movie coming out this summer that will produce more from the gut laughs than Me, Myself & Irene.  Sure it's crude, sure it's vulgar and juvenile at times, but sometimes we just have to take ourselves back to when we were younger and used to laugh at things that we would otherwise find rather disgusting.  The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank.  Hank does things that not many people would even dream of, and it's a kick to see him get away with some of them.  Equally funny are Charlie's three sons, who are highly intelligent, love their dad and use a certain phrase to great effect.  Some may find this movie offensive and occasionally funny at times, but I found it enjoyable from beginning to end.   A good way to blow off steam from a bad day.",2000
6,"I find it strange so many people disliked this movie. Just because a critic dislikes a movie, doesn't mean you have to dislike it too! I'm not suggesting it was the greatest comedy of all time, but it certainly achieved its purpose. ",2001

Jim Carrey's comedy antics (not seen this good in 3 years) makes a come back thanks to the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) who make their 2nd collaboration. Here, Carrey plays a gentle police officer who gets screwed in life so many times, he grows a new personality that is incredibly bad. ",2000
7,"OK, Jim Carrey fans, this is Jim doing some of his very best work. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off playing Charlie Baileygates. I was disappointed in Renee Zellweger's performance, but I'm not really a big fan of hers. (And, for the record, I'm also not too fond of Carrey's over-the-top style, but I pick and choose to make sure I see him in roles I would like.) The Farrelly brothers, known for their irreverent comedy, made this movie enjoyable and hilarious. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Just expect twists and turns that leave you laughing. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and it's not for kids. (If you've never seen a Farrelly movie, you'll need to know this!) This is not laden with ""Oscar-quality"" performances at all, but just something to watch when you want to laugh and not think. -- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. The plot was great, and the casting (overall) was incredible. I can't get over Charlie's family. You'll see! I find them the most fun of all. Watch it with good friends who love to laugh -- I think we can all find something like Charlie in all of us.",2006
8,"First let me say I really DID NOT LIKE ""Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb & Dumber"", But I totally  enjoyed this film.  It has a heart, that the other two do not.  Unlike ""Something About Mary"" the jokes are not based on people's physical pain or disabilities. Or in ""Dumb and Dumber"" where I just could not relate to or care about the ridiculous characters.  Instead, MM&I portrays a sweet, caring underdog that is being horribly taken advantage of by everyone and gives him a leg up in the world with the emergence of a split personality that takes revenge. This split personality is weird and a sicko but he kicks ass.  He's an unlikely hero, but gotta love him for coming to the rescue. It's silly fun that showcases Carey's talents very well. Jim has got to be the all time best physical comedy performer.",2002

1,"Compared to the other films by the Farrelly brothers - this is the grossest and the worst and, honestly, the least humorous.

How true those words are! Truly romantic films are so rare these days, while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors (""Mr. Chow,"" played by Tony Leung and ""Mrs. Chan,"" played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses are having an illicit affair, as they try ""not to be like them."" But after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother""), they fall madly in love, and must resist the temptation of going too far.",2002

Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichéd plots. The beautifully subdued photography, saturated in rich luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is filled with an air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured, there always seems to be a key prop, light fixture, or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world.",2005
10,"It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar-Wai's best film. The toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into Happy Together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of Kar-Wai's films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.",2000

I must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, I have ever watched. The content and the form overlaps perfectly. As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. Also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. And of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. Eventually, all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.",2004

After 90 minutes I left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film. I was appalled at the story itself, that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it. I just couldn't go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into it... I was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to ""see"" the film... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered the love... the beauty of the film. I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did I ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a film is, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music... and the light effects... the result is just a masterpiece!

Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai  also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. A really lovely film. Just prepare yourself for the ending.",2003

8,"Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It's not hard to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.",2005
10,The most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors. It isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either.,2003
8,"In Hong Kong, 1962, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight.",2004
10,"Whoa To be honest, I would have never seen this movie if it wasn't for my film class. It would have been my loss. The beginning of the film starts with a two different people moving into an apartment. This is scene that most people get lost in and then can't understand the movie. The theme of the film is about a two people who find out that there spouses are cheating on them with the other spouse. This is where the film took a unique path from the other Hollywood films, it follows the journey of them falling in love. The film is not about cheating, it is about the struggle and the tension created by Chow and So can be felt. The film is not about a sexual affair, but it is about an emotional affair. The story has a perfect ending for this film. The film is not like the rest of the other Love Film genre. The best thing about the film is the way it was filmed. The movie is ALL about tone. The tone is created by the songs and by the color of the scene. The music compliments the scene so perfectly, that the songs could have been a character in the film. The slow motion is overly used in many other films, but it is used perfectly in this film. The color of the scene and dresses is used to show the emotion that the two characters cannot show to each other. This film is an example about how film about romance can be shown without sex. This is a perfect example of why film making is an art work. The film sets a great tone, that the song ""Yumeji's Theme"" haunts me at night.",2009
3,"I seem to be one of the few people on this forum who think that this film is not some kind of 8th world wonder. Let's face it guys, it's nothing stunning... The film drags on endlessly, the film theme with strings is tedious and repetitive, there's no real plot, the film is edited together with bits and pieces. I agree, it is beautifully filmed and the cinematography is done very well. But if you compare it with 'Il Postino', another 'slow' movie with more or less the same main theme, then 'Il Postino' definitely is the most intriguing film. Close but no sigar.",2003

Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand cantonese, it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie. As simple as the story goes, many English speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me keep yapping and have no clues about the movie.",2001
10,"A rather lovely and poignant love story, told with a charming and sensitive perspective. We are reminded that it is sometimes what is not told outright that says the most or speaks to us in a path straight to the heart. The interesting use of multiple costumes to denote the passage of time and space show us the versatility of this director and story teller. His choice of cinematography, music, and even weather conditions add to the brilliant portrayal of life and love seemingly unrequited, joined with the interesting premise and location work to paint a portrait of two hearts joined on many levels and yet will they realize the full potential of those deep and genuine feelings? We are never quite sure, and even left to our imaginations as to the answers to these questions of love.",2009
5,I don't think I've been so shocked by a high rating on IMDb before. There are so many glowing reviews here I was expecting some kind of masterpiece but for me this was the biggest yawn fest I've seen in some time.,2015
1,This movie consists of the following - our heroes immaculately coiffed and dressed looking soulful. By the end I was longing for either some depth or some crudity to invade this ever so stylish work. Recommended if you think that fashion catalogues are works of literature. I would give this a 0 but i'm shocked to see that I have been forced to wildly overrate it by giving 1/10,2003
10,"In ""In the Mood for Love"", the director Wong Kar wai uses the only kind of lens movement pattern: shift shot. Compare his and other director camera movement, for example in film ""Swallowtail Butterfly"" -- the classic period of South Sea Girl shift shot . Wong Kar-wai's approach more simple and standard multi - there are pieces from their drop rate, middle-shift process is very stable, but is not fancy. ",2014
10,"I want to comment on the metaphors I found (maybe reading too much into the film itself) in Kar Wai Wong's film. The cinematography in this film is astounding in my opinion. The fact that most shots of the protagonists are through the reflection of a mirror is reminiscent of the fragmentary reality we live in, in which each perception and definition of the situation shapes the reality of the otherwise objective event; mirrors that can be metaphorically interpreted as the windows to our memories by the fact that they (as memories themselves) are blurred, cracked, and even stained symbolizing the gaps and even ""black holes"" that the unimportant events create in our conscious mind when we remember. They symbolize an opaque reality that is distorted not only by the passing of time, nor by the perception of each one of those involved, but by the needs and desires of the protagonists. A story that delves with the existential dilemmas of our era; the resolution of solitude, the acceptance and defiance of loneliness, the need for company and therefore love are echoed in Mrs Chan and Mr Chow's journey to one another. It is this common element and dilemma what drew them together in the first place and continued ruling the rest of their existences. Another incredible moment of the film, at least to me; is the final scene in the temple. It was very interesting to see how from the whole in which Chow ""whispered"" his secrets, a plant grew (from the mud we assume he puts after wards to seal the secret in) as if life and redemption would come out of any misfortune, or as a metaphor for the resilient condition of humanity and the capacity to be reborn in the presence of a painful situation. In this particular case; a metaphor o the love that grew from the hatred, sadness, and deep solitude felt before between the protagonists. Lastly but not least, what caught my attention was the depiction of a plate of apples set as a decoration in the beginning of the film, that were set in juxtaposition with a painting of still life (apples in fact) on the wall. I found it very interesting because again it is reminiscent on how each ones perceptions and definitions of a situation can determine the objectivity of a memoir, and affect the reality; and because it evoked, again, to the idea of the present and the past (in the end, it seems as if that painting made previously was created revolving around the apples seen in the present).",2014
10,"Maggie Cheung's Mrs Chan and Tony Leung's Mr Chow are husband and wife, but not to each other. Cheung is dressed gorgeously in no less than 46 Cheongsam dresses, each vivid and ornate, and often descends from the shared apartment in this formal dress and make-up to purchase noodles for a lonely dinner. Leung's hair is always immaculately gelled and styled, and he wears his one wrinkled grey suit with a sense of modesty in his presentation. They are in the mood for love, but they do not consummate it, for fears of becoming just like their cheating spouses. ",2015
2,"The best thing I can say about this film is the art direction, which conveys the claustrophobic inner world of its characters. Virtually without exterior shots, possibly due to budget constraints (i.e. trying to recreate early 60s Hong Kong), the film relies heavily on its lush, over-saturated interior surfaces to create the mood. Yet I would suggest that beyond being representational of the repressed passion of the characters, there is little more to see here besides the sets. The performances have been outlandishly overpraised by the ""less is more"" crowd. In particular, the often-wrong Cannes judges bestowed a best actor award for a performance that in fact does not even create a three-dimensional character, but focuses on long pulls on cigarettes and blank staring into space. Yeah, great stuff. Both my wife and I have seen thousands of films combined, and we both thought it underwritten, underacted, repetitive, and akin to watching paint dry. Beautiful paint, yes, but that's all.",2006

Adults will enjoy the brilliantly funny dialogue and the sweet, engaging story.  Parents will enjoy taking their kids to a movie that does not have the Disneyesque product tie-ins and must-buy soundtrack.   Movie buffs can try to count the references to The Great Escape, Stalg 17, Star Trek and Braveheart and may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the camera work.",2000
10,"This movie is all you could hope for in summer film fare.  It had action, suspense, romance and a large helping of comedy.  I was predisposed to love the movie, being a great fan of Wallace and Gromit, and the movie lived up to those other award-winning works.  The movie works on every level, and was fun for all ages viewing it.  Even my husband, who disdains children's movies, was truly enjoying himself.  Needless to say, the children loved it, despite one rather gruesome off-screen moment, but that seemed not to matter too much.  All in all, I can't recommend this movie too highly, it was incredibly entertaining and well-done.",2000

7,"The great animation director Chuck Jones has often stated that his cartoons ""weren't made for children.  Neither were they made for adults.  They were made for me.""  Jones's seven-minute shorts were made on a far lower budget than the animated features of today.  With features, much more money is at stake, as well as the livelihoods of more people.  Because of the pressure to make back the investment, animated features can give an impression of being created by committee, as though tailored to fit some committee's idea of a prefabricated audience segment.  It's remarkable, then, that Aardman Animation's ""Chicken Run"" shows off so much personality, the mark of a film made not for an imagined mass audience, but because it satisfied some need for the filmmakers-besides the need to put food on the table, that is.",2000

Most of the chickens seem pleased with their lives - although you get your head chopped if you don't give enough eggs - but Ginger is determined to get away.

Anyone who has seen it, will recall with great admiration the steadfast courage it took for the allied prisoners to continue to keep trying to escape, despite so many failed attempts. This movie "" Chicken Run "" is a Comedic reminder that courage is often the basis for other characters to be seen in that heroic light. Mel Gibson is the easily recognized voice behind 'Rocky' the flying rooster who believed he had escaped from the rigors of a performing circus. Unfortunately, his escape brings him to a chicken farm where he discovers Ginger, a egg laying hen who's trying to find freedom for all of her friends. The problem is Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson) are planning to convert their egg farm into a Chicken Pot Pie producing industry. Since they plan on modernizing their place, Ginger demands that Rocky teach the chicken how to fly before the transition. A delightful film for young and old alike.

Made by the same people who make the ""Wallace and Gromit"" cartoons, it portrays a gaggle of hens trying to break out of a British farm - some scenes even spoof ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"" - with the help of American rooster Rocky (Gibson). With the perfect blend of humor and suspense (and in a cartoon no less!), this is one movie that's sure to please everyone. I really liked the constant ""holiday"" comments, and that end sequence was a hoot. Also starring Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson, Jane Horrocks, Imelda Staunton, and Timothy Spall.",2006

Then one day ""Rocky the flying Chicken"", drops in from the sky, with a broken wing after making a landing on the chickens water barrel. Rocky then agrees he'll teach them to fly if they hide him from the circus(who come looking for him).

Don't get me wrong, it's an impressive film and it's thoroughly entertaining (most of the time), but the film should have been at least half an hour shorter, it seemed to move too slowly and repeat itself too many times. The pie machine set piece was brilliant though! (6/10)",2001

In a way, that kind of animation was more fun because it has such a personal touch. Each frame requires a human hand to make a change. Digital animators are brilliant, true, but let's face it: isn't digital all about making animation easier? There is a programmer and then a computer that does the actual work. Companies like Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic have made great strides, but a film like ""Chicken Run"" shows you that the Old School still has a few tricks up its sleeve. Just consider that they've made a big, spectacular, blockbuster film--in the year 2000--with Claymation!",2000

This is unquestionably the best scene in the film, both for its creativeness as well as its effectiveness. This kid falls asleep on the plane as everyone is boarding (another common occurrence among high school kids on planes filled with their friends, I'm sure), and has a dream about a defective seat back table and a subsequent, and pretty impressive, explosion on the plane that kills everyone.",2001

I had my first nightmare in over 4 years because I saw this movie. That's how I know it was good.  Also, I thought the plot was well thought out and the acting was great, especially Ali Larter, the girl has talent.  This flick stayed on focus and provided me with the necessary information and scare tactics that I was looking for. I recommend this movie to everyone! An A+ definitely.  Great idea to put Candyman in there as the coroner.  And, by the way, I love Ali's name in the movie, Clear Rivers, I thought that is so cool.

The buildup to before the plane crashes is long, drawn out, and overdone. And that's not even the worst thing about the movie. Each death scene shows a person doing regular activities, and they focus on about 17 different ways that person could die, until finally, after a ridiculous long amount of time, the person dies in the most completely impossible and stupid manner you could imagine. And not only that, the dialogue falls flat on the floor. There's nothing about the movie that even makes you remotely care about whether any of the characters live or die. I would expect better out of a high school project. I won't describe any of the death scenes in case you actually want to watch it, but my advice is: DON'T.

However, moments before the plane departs, Alex has a premonition the plane will explode in mid-air. Sensing he is about to die, he breaks for the exit in a violent plea to leave the aircraft. When he demands to be put off, several of his friends add to his fear by panicking. When they are asked to leave, they are held by the security police in the waiting area, where they all see the plane depart and then moments later explode in mid-air. There after things which should go better for him, having saved peoples lives, go terribly wrong. One by one all the people whom he saved begin to die mysteriously with Alex realizing he knows why.

Thought the story is a little contrived and a bit predictable(though that is part of the story) the effect is still the same. The movie is not, despite what you may hear, a teen flick, if you're a horror fan from any generation trust me you'll like it as long as you go in wanting to see it and willing to actually think about the film and follow the story line.

7,"When i heard that the original screenplay o this film planned no dialogue at all for the characters, i became even more disappointed at the end result. While a very good film Dinosaur certainly is, it could have been incredible. The visual effects alone are a sight to behold, never more so than in the opening sequence. This is probably the best stretch in the whole film for me; it's unsanitised by talking animals and genuinely feels like a prehistoric world (ignoring the multitude of historical inaccuracies like grass in the Mesozoic era, particular dinosaurs living side by side). Once the animals start to talk the film is bogged down by the shortcomings of the script, which is idealistic and morally exposition heavy, for the sake of the target audience. It also detracts from the illusion the film so effortlessly produces on the screen at the start; it all just becomes so standard an routine when it seemed to be so much more. With a weak script, the visuals no longer arrest like they did before and would have done had nobody talked. Without the amazing cgi, this could have almost been straight to video.",2006

Of course I cannot compare the dinosaurs from this movie to the ones of Jurassic Park, since they are very different from each other, but I can say that they both look very real. But this movie, in my opinion, has more points because of the animation then the story itself. It's cute, but with a very ordinary story; besides, there are some important errors here, specially in the beginning in the part of the meteor, when everything is destroyed in the Plio's island: That Impact would kill not only the lemurs,but also many of the dinos.

Unlike Jurassic Park, this film is made by Disney, which means to sell to the kids, their had to be as much work put in to make human-like dinosaurs as there was to animate them.  And it struck odd to me that dinosaurs actually had human emotions and characteristics (and lemurs looked a whole lot different 65 million years ago).  Still, there is a two sided mirror to this film.  If you are looking for great animation and effect animation techniques, this film is calling for you more than a worried parent.  But if you are looking for a good story and characters, rent The Land Before Time (because this is a replica of it almost).  A-",2000
10,"this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.",2005

8,"I honestly don't see why people are so upset whit this movie. Yes, there is talking dinosaurs, but how are you supposed to understand them otherwise. Mute dinosaurs walking around wouldn't be interesting at all and remember, this is a kid's movie. And yes, the animation might not be as good as in Jurassic Park, but this is a fully animated movie, JP used a mix of animatronics and CGI inside an otherwise live action movie, and in a interview I saw, Spielberg (or if it was a special effects guy, I don't remember) said that they would use the animatronics when ever possible and only cover up rigs and refine movement with the computer 'cause the CGI models looked like crap in comparison the robots. And yes, the story has been used before, but so has the story in most films we're watching today, only in varying degree and in different mixes and it's not like Disney is known for their originality story wise. As good as everyone of their Classics are based or inspired by other works.",2015
10,"I have seen this movie many times over the years with my older children and they all have loved it. I have just introduced it to my 2 yr old. He loves it too!! After only a few days he knows almost all the words. Its an entertaining movie, that has a great story line of friendship, love, and acceptance for children. It shows how being a friend to all no matter what species, and age wins in the end. It shows how being mean and tough doesn't get friends. And to those that are complaining about the accuracy for the time period, I am pretty sure that the dinosaurs didn't talk either. I do like this movie better then the Land Of Times movies for kids. ",2012
5,"Just like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"", ""Dinosaur"" is an exercise of style over substance. While the animation from this film is incredibly good (Even by modern standards) the plot lacks of any kind of interest, being shallow and unoriginal. And to get it worse, it is incredibly boring. The beginning of the film is quite impressive actually. Without any dialogue (Besides a brief opening narration), that first sequence is way more interesting than the rest of the movie, which basically is some sort of CGI version of ""The Land Before Time"", but lacking of all the charm and the endearing characters from that film. And that's why ""Dinosaur"" doesn't work: Besides of the good animation, the plot remains bland and dull, with many scenes that are pretty to look at, but are quite forgettable, at best. All the attempts to include some elements of comedy in the serious context of the story are ineffective, being most of them quite annoying. ""Dinosaur"" could be magnificent in what concerns to the visual aspect, but sadly, it fails at the most important thing: Being entertaining. It is way too silly and shallow too be interesting for the adults, but at the same time, it is way too boring and heavy-handed to be enjoyable for the kids. To be honest, I enjoyed more any episode from ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" than this.",2011

They are beautiful unforgettable dinosaurs that have their own unique personalities, which is one of the things that makes ""Dinosaur"" a terrific film. This film actually lets you interact with animals that existed 65 million years ago! Also, there are a lot of great climaxes and transitions from one scene to another. The ending of ""Dinosaur"" was also very marvelous as it lets you see the splendor of the circle of life. ""Dinosaur"" meets all my standards of a great film and I must say that it is a truly beautiful movie.",2005

He's the one man women probably wish understood them.At any rate,Gibson really turns on the Gibson charm here and there's not a better film in which to do that.Helen Hunt makes a great leading lady and is her usual charming self.Also,from the supporting cast,it's always great to see Alan Alda,one of the most underrated actors of our time.This film starts with a very unique,funny idea,and it does not disappoint in terms of how good it can be executed.Well casted,well directed and very funny film.",2002
7,"This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds(possibly thousands) of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking. OK for a romantic comedy. 7/10",2004
8,"Mel Gibson is known as sort of a macho action hero, and stereotyped into his Mad Max/Martin Riggs persona.  But I've noticed (except for ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"") he injects comic relief into almost anything he does.  So doing a straight comedy doesn't seem like much of a stretch, and as you watch in a movie like this Gibson's timing and delivery is impeccable.  On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags.",2001

8,"Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call `What Women Want,' directed by Nancy Meyers, `just' a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well. Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.'  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. 	The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice. 	Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength-- and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film. And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",2001
3,"Yeah-yeah. I know that laughs and ""comedy"" were the intended goal of this film here, but, all the same, aren't us men supposed to be the ""shallow"" gender of the 2 sexes? I mean, aren't we? ",2014
10,"This was the most fun I've had movie-watching in at least a year. It had me laughing, talking to the characters (mainly ""Oh, no!"" and ""Watch out!""), and eager to see what would happen next. I guess it's true that women are difficult for men to understand because what we're are thinking often contradicts what we're saying. What DO women want? The casting was wonderful, the acting was superb, and the direction was perfect. I heard that Tim Allan had been considered for the lead role. He would've been a great choice, but so was Mel Gibson. Bravo to one and all! Now how about doing a similar movie with a woman hearing men's thoughts, hmmmm? Just as Shirley Temple helped distract grateful Americans from the Great Depression, we need more comedies like this to distract us from equally-distressing things.",2014
7,"Look at another review for plot outline...you won't find one here, just my opinion :) Weird movie. But good, don't get me wrong, I enjoy it immensely and have it in my collection, mainly due to the fact that Mel Gibson is a male actor I made into a surrogate Dad when I was younger, so I always enjoy watching him (much better actor than he is a director, but that's arguable i guess, anyway he's too religiously weird for me to like his ""serious"" directorial efforts.",2007

OK, the character is _meant_ to be obnoxious, in order to give the film its comedic spin, but boy does Mel smarm and squirm his way through the role. As most other comments have said, the women characters, particularly Tomei, are woefully underdeveloped and underused, leaving the film to stand and fall on Gibson's performance.",2001
4,"21st century variant on the old battle-of-the-sexes theme, naturally spiked with an extraordinary gimmick to put the material over with today's seen-it-all audiences. Mel Gibson plays a womanizing ad-exec in Chicago who--through electrocution!--is suddenly able to read the minds of all females. At first, he uses this newfound gift for personal gain, but soon finds himself becoming a more caring and sensitive man who learns to listen before he speaks. Fast-paced but dim, fatuous comic fantasy of male and female relations in modern times. It purports to be speaking the Truth about the sexes, but in the interim tosses off a lot of snappy lines and superficial answers. Most of the female performers are directed to be hammy and irritating, and nearly everyone in the cast overacts. Gibson manages to retain his appeal, though even he can't save the film from a sour finish. ** from ****",2006

6,"In the 1960's, popular writer and psychiatrist, Eric Berne wrote a book upon which this film should have been its premise. The book was called the 'games people play.' This interesting, quirky, comedy movie is called "" What women want. "" It tells the story of a top Manhattan, executive, Nick Marshall, (Mel Gibson) in the advertising business who experiences a shocking electrical accident which leaves him with the ability to read women's minds. Much like another movie, 'The Misadventures of Merlin Jones.' Although females at his place of employment consider him to be a snobbish, egocentric, male chauvinist and brutish womanizer, he sees himself the opposite. Slated for a promotion, he is dismayed when he is not. Instead another executive, a female, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) is chosen. Believing he is cursed, he seeks a doctor who convinces him it's not a curse, but a blessing. Although, there is much to learn, Marshall soon adapts and uses his power to sabotage Darcy and her efforts. Alan Alda plays Dan Wanamaker, Gibson's boss, with Marisa Tomei, Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine in supporting roles, this movie sails well, until the principals meet to resolve their predicament, which in this reviewer's opinion, leaves much to be desired. Nevertheless, Gibson does a good job and is able to produce many a smile with his feminine antics. ****",2010
5,"Every once and a while there comes a movie of which you really regret the fact that it's premise is just fiction Life would so much easier if this was true. Dig this: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and when he comes to his senses again, he can actually READ women's minds!! What a treat that must be! Last time I suffered slight electrocution I was shivering for 3 days and Gibson gets to understand women??? Anywayabout the film. It all may look fresh and light-headed but in fact it's pretty routine and annoyingly superficial! We learn that the stuff women think about is actually ordinary and rather obvious (they don't want to get hurt emotionally, they want to prove that there's more to them than just a pretty face etc etc) The screenplay contains a few major clichés, like tremendous emotional speeches and Gibson who automatically gets mistaken for a gay man. Or that dreadful moral about waiting for your `first time' till you're ready for it yourself?? Yuck! As far as I'm concerned, they could have done much better things with this basic idea. There are a few positive aspects to discover as well, of course. The acting for example. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are a terrific on-screen couple and I really wish they had been given a better script to work with. Some good acting by familiar faces in smaller roles as well, such as Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, Marisa Tomei and even Bette Midler. `What Women Want' has got a high level of feel-good moments and feminisation message, but it's overall pretty neutral. Good, smooth soundtrack thoughLot's of Frank Sinatra oldies!",2004
10,"Never get tired of watching this movie. It has such comic appeal as well as great writing and acting. I think it gets across a really good message. I loved Mel Gibsons performance and his dance scene to Frank Sinatra's "" I Won't Dance"" is amazing. I never knew he was that talented! All in all, WWW hits on all cylinders and holds up to repeat viewings as I have caught it many times on cable and no mater where it is in the movie I enjoy it. I know many people have an opinion about Mel as a person but in his acting roles he shines! From MAd Max to We Were Soldiers to What Woman Want, Gibson plays his roles as the character written for the movie and he does it brilliantly. I only wish he had had a chance to play Batman! 9/10",2008

A great plot, a social statement, and a truly inspiring love story, this movie has it all, including some very very funny parts. This is not a no-brainer slap stick comedy but one that makes you think about our interaction with other people and how it effects them and you.

1,"I'll admit that Girlfriends didn't look so bad for the first 5 episodes. Im not sure why I watched this junk for at least 3 seasons but I guess I was just being optimistic that this show might have gotten better as it progressed but it didn't. There are times when this show blatantly rips off elements of Sex and The City. In this review I'll state everything that made me despise this show. The characters are pretty obnoxious and as the show progresses its hard to like them because they do some pretty stupid things to jeopardize their lives. Joan Clayton(Tracee Ellis Ross) cant keep a steady relationship with a man to save her life. Maya Wilkes(Golden Brooks) doesn't know if she wants to be with Darnell or not and she drives him as well as the viewers of this show nuts with her high strung antics. Lynn Seacy(Persia White) is the most likable character in this show but she is not without her flaws. She does not know if she wants to be with men or women(and she drives them both insane), She is very scatterbrained and when people depend on her she is likely to fail them. Plus I found it very typical that the most likable character of all of them is the one of mixed heritage. Toni Childs(Jill Marie Jones) is the most reprehensible of all characters. As a matter of fact she is probably the most insufferable character in sitcom history. She is a high class gold-digger that puts poor Todd Garrett(Jason Pace) through hell. So much so that when he took her to court that I was ecstatic but unfortunately the idiot had to feel sympathy for this loathsome tramp and dropped the case. William Dent(Reginald C Hayes) would be a likable character but his moronic horn dog ways makes it virtually impossible to like him. He ruins what could have been a decent relationship with his boss(played by Anne Marie Johnson) to be a pig and is constantly running back to that gold-digging self-centered trollop Monica(Keesha Sharpe), even though her love for him was only on a financial level. Pluss episode after episode is wasted on him chasing after Donna Williams(Jill Scott) and we all know that wouldn't have worked out at all. Darnell Wilkes(Khalil Khan) seems somewhat smart till you realize that only a fool would put up with Maya for so long. There are plenty of episodes that make me disgusted with this show but there is one episode that is stuck in my mind eternally. The episode where William forgets to pose as Santa Claus(or Satan's Claws) for Jabari and the the girls were mad at him for that made me sick to my stomach. First of all we all know that Santa Claus is an imaginary character so you're going to get angry at William because he doesn't cater fairy tales to a little boy that needs to be fed truth in order to grow up to be a mentally stable adult? How insane is that? And we wonder why these kids grow up to be so self- destructive. If they are fed these poisonous fairy tales all their lives how can they deal with reality? Any Black parent that feeds their kids these harmful tall tales needs to be locked up for the rest of their natural lives. ",2009
6,"I used to love Girlfriends until 2 things happened - 1) I got a DVR & started watching lots of episodes in a short time frame & 2) I started watching Sex & City for the first time w/ DVR. The more I watched Girlfriends the less I like the characters. They treated each other (& the people around them)horribly & the characters have not developed since the first season, & they were all incredibly self-absorbed. By contrast, the Sex & the City girls had all gone through incredible introspection & ended up moving & growing by their final season. W/ respect to treating each other mean - I could not even conceive of being friends w/ Toni after she tried to sleep w/ my man & Joan was so selfish that she turned Maya's & Toni's weddings into mini-dramas about even crying that she couldn't wait for the nightmare of Toni's wedding to be over. By contrast, Charlotte had a hard time w/ Miranda's pregnancy but she was still incredibly supportive.

Too many things you see in the movie are simply beyond belief. But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell.",2004

The first clip I saw was the scene in the bar where John Travolta's character 'Terl' says his infamously cheesy ""While you were still learning how to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer galaxies"" line. The clip was on the YouTube video 100 top cheesiest quotes and at first I didn't recognise the fact that it was John Travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line and instead thought it was a secondary character or a comic relief, so I dug further in and decided to have a stab at watching this, hoping to God that it was what I had suspected. It was not, and in fact, it was much worse than that.",2012

Somewhere along the line, I most definitely will have to pat the air force empathetically on the shoulder. Man, must they feel like idiots!

1,"If ever there was a movie to unseat ""Volcano"" at the top of my list of worst sci-fi movies of all time, ""Battlefield"" is the one - and I grew up on old B-movies like ""Wasp Woman"". While the premise is appealing entertainment, there isn't one redeeming quality about this production. Travolta was at his worst (I haven't seen all his work, but enough), but what sticks in my craw is how the writers love to ignore common sense. I was willing to accept the film for it's b-movie status until the (essentially) Stone Age people got into still-operational fighter jets and went into battle. I belched a guffaw just as I did when Anne Heche was dangling a few feet above two-thousand degree lava (in the aforementioned ""Volcano"") without so much as a hair being burnt, yet there's a pressurized fire-hose above her that was on fire. I can't believe the audacity or stupidity in Hollywood. The target audience was probably 8-year-olds. Maybe it was written by 8-year-olds.....",2011

After returning the video I honestly asked the clerk that even when I'm very drunk to stop me from renting this movie ever again. Hopefully he'll remember that. Although the movie starts funny as we can see Travolta and Whitaker argue in their silly suits about slaves, this quickly turns to boredom. The rest of the movie is the standard very bad, short on budget Si-fi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry (ok) and teaches it to his barbarian mates (huh?) who immediately appreciate the essence of it all (they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is). But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces. Check out the fact that the main character discovers the national library and finds a crisp fresh version of the constitutional law (it has been in that very same destroyed library for almost 1000 years and doesn't show any signs of decay ?) At has been a long time since I cried....",2001
2,This movie should have been a 'Project Redlight'. John Travolta is out of his head and hopelessly devoted to L. Ron Hubbard. That he was able to con 10 other people into investing $80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake. ,2005

To give you an idea of how boring this movie is, imagine a movie about Bruce Lee, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris filing their income taxes.

It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen . Maybe Travolta should have stuck to his guns and played Jonnie . He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper)  and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos , sounds just like psychos , I bet they `re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ? And why do they think "" Rat brains "" is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the "" man animals "" to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term "" Man animals "" irritating ? Surely it should be "" Manimals "" ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and Harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they`ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way: Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week.

In this film of heart break, betrayal, true friendship, and love, Cusak adapts Hornby's book perfectly, melding self doubt, fear of death, and a search for truth with modern cinema and pop music.  Rob, Dick, and Barry are all struggling men in their late twenties (thirties in the book) trying to find a way to identify themselves, and live at peace.  Rob has the most conflict as he flounders through one relationship to another, never getting comfortable, and always finding a way to mess it up.  It's a brilliant tale of coming to terms with reality, and having a bit of fun along the way.  The casting was pheonimal, scenes perfectly picked, and music parallelling that of the mood set in the book. It's just a shame so much had to be cut.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with a calloused ear and a desire to finally relate with a character.",2002

Apparently it was supposed to be a dramatic, romantic comedy, but I can't think of a single moment during the movie at which I felt any emotion other than an outpouring of suicidal rage.  There was no comedy whatsoever (unless gratuitous use of ""F***"" counts as comedy), no romance whatsoever (unless talking about people you had sex with counts as romance), and no drama whatsoever (unless you count the precious seconds until the movie is over).  Avoid this movie like the plague.

Also so nice to see Natalie Wood's daughter Natasha in a bit part which she played beautifully. Not really made before the days of cell phones per se, but no cell phones or anything electronic to distract people in this movie which gives a feeling of simple comfort to it.

Sure there are many ""cliche'"" scenes and some ""bad acting,"" but over all, for me at least, it was a very enjoyable escape into a world of unending possibilities. There were many memorable characters. Of course Jessica Alba as Max is a great reason to watch this series, but so is Jensan Ackles. I grew to actually like Alec. Who can forget the lovable mutant Joshua, the romantic struggle between Max and Logan, and the excitable action sequences? I'm just saying, many people are focusing on the negative aspects of this show. If you look for things to complain about, you'll find them.

There is action, there are conspirators and there is tense love between main actors. I regret the most that there is no real ending in love between Max and Logan. I know a lot of time passed since last season and that actors aged (not that it matters, most of them like Alba, Weatherly and Ackles look mainly the same), but it would be really cool to have a better ending, at least in a movie, which is maybe even better idea then another seasons.

Spades Kuzco provides the appropriate amount of trademark sarcasm and wit, along with the rest of the characters appeal to make a movie that hasn't gotten old yet.

As was said in the behind the scenes on the DVD, most jokes are only funny the first time they are told, but many of the key scenes in this movie are funny every time ie: Waterfall scene, trotting out the ladies, and the diner scene. My impression is that there are many who wished that the ""Empire of the Sun"" version were made instead, desiring a more ""deep and meaningful or artistic"" movie, but for many, having only seen a few of what appear to be foreboding and dark themed cels, we are glad that it evolved into ENG instead. It is disappointing that Disney feels that it should shun this movie, in word and deed.

This movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.

The plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to ""subtly"" explain it. The creatures in this movie are also very interesting.  You don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through. Overall, a very entertaining movie.",2000
8,"I must say that I didn't expect much sitting down to watch ""Pitch Black,"" but I got a lot back, in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the type of flick where you can just lean back, relax, and have a great time just being entertained. This isn't a deep film by any means. Everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as ""Alien,"" ""Predator"" or such. But when I watch a rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. ",2003
10,"From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked.  I had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead I found a highly entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thought provoking action film.  The movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other..) as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.",2000
8,"Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said ""oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it."" Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.",2006
10,"""Pitch Black"" was a complete shock to me when I first saw it back in 2000. In the previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. But to plainly put it: This movie freaked me out... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the dark till I watched this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.",2005
10,"As a zombie fan, I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall, I recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. You won't be disappointed.",2004
10,"This movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns.  Among the passengers is convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings, an eclipse of all three suns happens.  Shortly afterwards, scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one.  During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs have been surgically shined, giving him night vision.  The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety.",2004
8,"When the transport ship ""Hunter-Gratzner"" is hit by a meteor shower, the pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) is awaken from the cryogenic sleep and tries to control the vessel with forty passengers. She is forced to release a module and only Carolyn; the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the religious Abu ""Imam"" al-Walid Lewis (Keith David); the dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz- Gerald); Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black); the runaway teenager Jack (Rhiana Griffith); John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore); Suleiman (Les Chantery); Hassan (Sam Sari); Ali (Firass Dirani); and the dangerous criminal Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) survive. Riddick escapes and Johns scares the survivors telling how dangerous he is. The group is stranded in the desert and find that place is heated by three suns and they team-up to seek for water and supplies. Soon they discover that there are under siege of flesh eating aliens that attack in the darkness; further, the planet will be pitch black with a total eclipse. They conclude that it is not with Riddick that they have to be worried about.",2016
7,"From the opening crash scene - a classic, even if it does mess around with the laws of inertia - to the closing scene, this is pulse pounding sci-fi horror with a bravura performance from Vin Diesel. The CGI and effects serve the plot, and not the other way around.",2009
10,"As a dyed in the wool sci fi fan it has been years since I've seen anything come out of the Hollywood machine that was so smart and spine tingly at the same time (Carpenter's The Thing comes to mind). The CGI is great - mostly seamless, Diesel is a real sexy anti-hero and the dialogue really keeps things moving. Vin Diesel is a rare one that can pull off the stunts of an action sci fi thriller and not come across as a large block of wood with a toothy smile. I went after this movie when it came out following the career of Claudia Black from Farscape and found a new favorite in Diesel - but still waiting to see Black in a more substantial role. Now all that being said no film is without flaws and if you have watched enough sci fi or horror then the 'plot twist' at the end was lined up for us from the beginning but I for one didn't care in that I fell hook line and sinker for Riddick and wanted to find out what he would and wouldn't do and it was such a delicious way to get there. I'm greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick and if you have the where with all to follow a character and not just a blockbuster then go check out Dark Fury too. It is a great segway and though brief is a good character study.",2004
9,Not in order The crash landing...I see where Star Wars Ep.3 garnered inspiration from. The blood thirsty creatures. Cleverly displayed dark and fleeting; there's 3 scenes I saw them in detail. I still debate which species is worse the 1979 Alien or these guys...still can't decide. Anywhoo I love their deceptively sweet whale-esquire sounds and how relentless and by and large unstoppable.,2009
7,"Let's face it. David Twohy has written some good screen plays, and he has also put out some real stinkers. I didn't know quite what to expect with this work, but what I didn't expect was this gritty, fresh science fiction work. I don't know that this will make ""cult classic"" status, but in my opinion, it should.",2007
10,I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.,2004
9,"Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. ",2015
1,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year and this is not exactly the best year for movies. The story line was interesting but the characters were one dimensional and boring. The ways the characters reacted to their spaceship crashing on an unknown planet was like they just woke up and were like, hey were on a strange freaky planet we're not suppose to be on, and oh yeah theres some booze. Like they didn't really care, like its something that occurs to them every day. That certainly was really unrealistic. I think anyone would be in shock. And they just happen to have a guy who can see very well in the dark. How convienent! Yeah I know a whole bunch of those people. And I know someone who can breathe underwater to save me just in case I'm drowning. Another part of the movie that displayed how poor the directing was handled was in one scene they are walking towards this abandoned station, theres a few buildings there and a spaceship, then they're coming back to their own spaceship and suddenly out of nowhere they have this space car that their driving around. What is this some kind of magical movie? Where we're supppose to fill in all the holes in the plot ourselves? The sad thing is that there are people who actual liked this movie. What kind of world are we living in?",2000

1,"Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell are both talented performers, however, this movie could not be saved by them or their talent. The movie was B movie quality at best. The plot dragged, Diesel came off as one dimensional and Radha came off as whiny. I didn't want to root for either character and I didn't care what happened to either of them. As the movie progressed I became angry at the performers and the filmmakers; I felt like they were subjecting me to some form of sick torture and I never so desperately wanted to walk out of a movie before in my entire life.",2003
9,"Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick is very convincing in this film, which starts a series of two, and hopefully there will be trequel to this. The movie is very well done, with excellent sceneries, great tension, smart plot and excellent suspense all the way through. Several people survive on a planet and start a bloody fight against horrible man-eating flying creatures, merciless and cruel. Nothing new? Well, Riddick makes it very fresh and upbeat. He is cool, strong, cynical and very clever. He is not daunted or haunted, he acts in cold blood and his actions seem cruel at first, but then it is him who saves at least three people and helps them escape the bad place that they had landed on. Vin Diesel proves that he is a good drama actor and not simply a strong guy with muscles. He does play and does that admirably well. Good work, smart and clever.",2007
1,"A very predictable film that should appeal to pre-adolescent boys or someone starved for entertainment because of the gore factor and cleavage shots. About 30 minutes into this piece of c**p I was cheering for the monsters. Poorly written, acted and directed. I could not believe the moron at the video store compared it to Alien. Alien is a sci-fi classic. This steaming pile is a B movie at best that Alan Smithee would be mortified to be associated with. If you are older than 12 or have an IQ above 85 don't waste your time or money. I did not think it was possible to make a movie worse than Sphere yet they were able to top themselves with this one.",2000

10,"what can i say about this show that hasn't been already said? it is perfect. entertainment, fun, psychology, beautiful surroundings...there is one thing however that often puzzles me. i recently read an interview with jeff probst (the host of the show) and he said that contestants are not allowed any cosmetics etc. on the show. well, how come girls always have they eyebrows perfectly shaped, no sign of hair on their legs or intimate areas and head locks look washed and clean? it's been puzzling me for a while.castaways don't look the part. also why so many beautiful people? i understand the show must sell and probably whoever is responsible for casting must comply with that rule but at the same time the show seems less real because of that.i would really like to see normal people with cellulite and other flaws some time.other than that i wholeheartedly recommend it. hope the show will go on for as long as i'll be able to watch it.",2010
10,"I'm extremely critical when it comes to television and there aren't many shows around that I DON'T pan. Survivor happens to be one of them. I can't get enough of this show! For me, it's really more of a game show with a mix of reality, drama and characterisation thrown in. The best part is that fact that these are real everyday people and not actors, who are thrown into a fantasy situation and left to their own devices (most of the time). I also enjoy the way certain characters grow on you and others are repulsed as each season draws closer and closer to the end. For some strange reason I particularly find the contestants more attractive when they're in their natural state and in their element than when they're back in the studio, all ""glammed up"" and civilised. I wonder if I'm alone in this...",2006
10,"Wow myself and this show go way back when Richard Hatch won. I am one of few people that can honestly claim to be an "" Ultimate Fan "". Im such a fan that I even wrote about survivor in high school English for a paper / also a poem about survivor . The game has to do with your physical , mental , emotional and social abilities. Survivor is strategic - as there slogan goes you have to "" outwitt outplay and outlast "" . Life is like that to .",2013

I read in one of the above comments that Survivor's odd numbered seasons are usually not that good, i wanna say that i don't agree at all! Coz, Survivor 17: Gabon, was simply awesome... and i'm just starting season 19, i.e. Samoan, and its looking cool as well. The best thing in Survivor is the picturisation, the natural scenery, the diverse cast, and last but not the least Emmy Award winner and this year's nominee for best host : Jeff Barrot...",2009
10,"Lots of people say that this show is getting really old. I have to disagree. I just love the concept of the show. Vote people out until there's only one person standing. I love it! I want to go on it, but I don't think it'll be around anymore by the time I turn 21. Still, it's a great show. Great competition, likable people (most of the time), and a 1 million dollar prize. This last season (Fiji) was really boring, but I know the show can still stay fresh. It's always really fun to watch, and I always get upset if I miss an episode.",2007
8,"This is what started the trend of reality TV shows. And that it was an original as you didn't know what to expect at all. As sixteen, later eighteen or twenty castaways are stranded on an deserted island. And these strangers must learn to work together and put their brains and brawns to the test. Or be voted out if they lose. Borneo was the original one. But the best ones were Australia, Pearl Island, All-Stars, Paulu, and Guatemala. Worst ones were Vanuatu, Fiji, and Thailand, due to less likable cast mates. Host Jeff Probst(Access Hollywood) is a master as host. Being both a friend, ""drill sergeant, moderator, big brother"" all rolled up into one. Nineteen seasons later, with two seasons a piece per year since 2000. And still strong though not as water-cooler talk as it used to be. But still goes strong placing in the top ten of TV ratings about each and every year!",2009
1,This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.,2007
10,"As far as entertainment goes, at times it really doesn't get any better than Survivor. Especially the first season or two you watch. I've never been the type of person to change up my plans or not schedule any plans just because a show I liked was going to be on TV... that is until Survivor (the first season or two I watched that is). I would be so exited leading up to the show and be completely enthralled throughout. I remember cramming for my midterms/finals and even though I didn't have any extra time to spare I couldn't skip out on Survivor (a couple times). ",2016
10,"Survivor is a show that is impossible to judge as a whole. There are 10/10 seasons, and there are 1/10 season's. This comes with having 34 season's. The thing that's great about Survivor is that it can never die. Each season is different, so even though many seasons might not be great, many others will be incredible! Yes, Survivor's early seasons were some of its greatest, but many later seasons have been amazing. Think 27, 28, 31, 33. The evolution of the show is what makes it intriguing. New strategies being developed right in front of your eyes. No other TV concept can stay the same, yet still be constantly changing and refreshed.",2017
4,"You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).",2009
6,"This is one of those shows where I wish IMDb would categorize every single season of Survivor in the database. Seriously there are over 20 seasons of Survivor and when it's good, it's REALLY good with 10/10 material. *cough* Amazon *cough*",2015
10,Survivor was and I hope that it will continue to be the most addictive tv show ever. Season after season the competition improves and the new twists add originality and surprise. There´s no doubt about the fact that SURVIVOR will always be among one of my favourite programmes. Long live the king of reality TV!!!,2018
10,"As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood.",2000

10,"Crouching Tiger is Ang Lee's take on the Wu Xia tradition of film making. Wu Xia, for those not familiar with the style, evolved out of popular Chinese fiction. It contains formulaic elements such as honourable warriors, powerful swordswomen, powerful swords, and often magic and mythical beasts. Possibly, it has a parallel with sword and sorcery pulp literature  and even Western romances.",2004
9,"I just saw this film today.  I was totally captivated... when it was all over, and the credits began to run, it took me a couple of seconds to realize where I was.  I didn't want to get out of my seat.  And once I got out of the theatre, I couldn't even talk about it for an hour or so.  I kept running the details over and over in my head.  It's rare that a film has such an impact on me.  The cinematography was stunning.  The special effects were beautifully done.  The characters' moves were effortless.  The acting was wonderful.  I really think that Michelle Yeoh should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I thought that the effects and storyline complimented each other brilliantly.  There were so many different layers to the plot.  There were many things that couldn't be explained with dialogue that were expressed in the characters' faces.  This film had lighthearted moments, heartwrenching moments, romantic interludes, inspirational sentiments, wonderful plot twists, superb acting, beautifully done fight scenes, never before seen special effects...it had it all.  Some scenes may have been a little over the top, but it's *fantasy*... and yet, after a few brief moments, it somehow became completely believable. That's how much this film draws you in.  This is a one of a kind film; there is just no comparing it to any other.  It transports you to another place and time.   I highly recommend it.",2001

10,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, quite simply, a stunning film and a real breath of fresh air in a genre that was previously somewhat stagnant. Kung-fu films were on a very steady decline, with only Jet Li making a valid effort to change things around. It comes then as a great relief that Ang Lee decided to do what he did and put an entirely new slant on the genre.",2001

8,"Chinese martial arts films had found a market in the West during the Kung Fu boom initiated by Bruce Lee in the early 1970s But ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrifice ",2008

Yes, it is that bad. Two women sitting in front of me kept shooting dirty looks my way, but really how could anyone take this absurd movie seriously?

Really, I usually agree with most whether a movie is good or not but I can't see what anybody gets out of this.  It didn't even hold the attention of the kids who love martial arts flicks.  The fight sequences were so unrealistic and choreographed that they made a Jackie Chan movie look like a documentary.  As for the plot, a love affair that should not be, intermixed with a stolen relic.  Oh, that's a new one.  I've never seen anything like that before.

Now, some brilliant Chinese person got the idea to market one of these films over in America and people are falling all over themselves gushing about it since they don't know that it is the same old thing as always.

It`s a movie of almost legendary status but I was slightly disappointed with it for one reason that I`ll come to shortly . First of all may I just point out that there`s a lot of acclaim that is justified , it`s a beautifully made film down to its technical areas like the cinematography ( Check out the final stunning scene ) the editing , the soundtrack and the choregraphy . It also has a sense of humour best summed up in the scene at the tea house but this scene - Indeed the whole movie - is let down by something and that something is this : It`s obvious the fleet footed characters are being pulled up and down on a harness . No matter how much the production team try to disguise it it`s obvious this is how the technique is achieved and spoiled the film for me greatly",2004

And journey is the river that flows to its end, leaving legacy behind, and its story is one of honor, strength, passion, conflict, and depth. And tears of sadness flow endlessly over heroes that fight to the death, and inspiration is the ink that gives dreams hope of freedom. And the power of emotion are the strings pulling our heart, and we are swept away into an overwhelming tale of love, loss, and legend. And tension beats against a thousand drums as the fighting stance is taken, and the beauty of music stirs our soul like a gentle breeze across the desert.

10,"First, I don't think it matters that there are subtitles and the language is Chinese. The story is strong and moves along smoothly. The fighting scenes are worth watching alone. The actors are choreographed to dance and fight with you just wanting to see who defeats. The story is also told with great costumes, art direction, and scenery. The stars of this film are Asian actors and actresses who don't get enough work in this business. While the subtitles might throw you off, it's not hard to understand what's going on by studying their actions, movements, and facial expressions. If Ang Lee had the actors talk in English throughout the film, I don't think it would have lost much value to me since I'm not Asian or Chinese or the audience. I believe that this is one of the best foreign language films of the last decade and it was awarded an Oscar for Foreign Language Film. Although I don't think Ang Lee cared about awards in making this film, this film has female characters who are both strong and equal to the male characters in the film. The females sometimes steal the scenes from the men. It's nice to see women portrayed as strong, equals than emotional inferior characters. They are equally adept at the fighting scenes and they give their all to those scenes. When you think of Ang Lee's other films, nothing could really master the beauty and uniqueness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",2006
10,"on how I view other movies. This movie was so fresh and exciting that it made me look at the Asian cinema scene a little closer. The story alone is great. It is simple and very different from what I am used to here in the States. Visually it was one of the best movies I have ever scene. From the effects matching the tone of the movie, to the locations and the colors used in those locales. The fight scenes were very cool. I love good fight scenes and I love swords. This movie pulls off both very nicely. Since I have watched this movie, I have watched many other Asian films and I find them refreshing. The movies are more story driven with a heavy emphasis on tones. I might watch this movie this weekend now that I am thinking of it. Really cool movie especially on a rainy night.",2004
10,"Nothing I can say about this film will do it justice. Forget that it's in Mandarin, you will anyway after a few minutes of watching. Much has been made of the fact that the lead actors were not native speakers of Mandarin, but the fact that they learned their dialog and were able to emote within the tightly confining inflective structure of the language speaks to the amount of skill, effort, and dedication that went into making this masterpiece. And yes, the main characters can fly, so it isn't exactly cinema verite', but we accept far more from movies that do far less to convince us to do so. What CTHD is is a stunning, epic telling of a beautiful Chinese fable that rivals any in Western culture.",2001
9,"Despite being somewhat manipulative, despite being based on true events, despite essentially being a Julia Roberts' vehicle to the extreme, Steven Sodebergh hits a home run with his David and Goliath story. ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.",2005
10,"Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich is exactly the uplift picture you've always hoped for. strong acting, moving script, important issues, legitimate procedurals and best of all it is scrupulously faithful to its true story. Struggling outspoken single mom, Erin (the Oscar winning performance by Julie Roberts proving irrevocably that she is more than just tits and teeth), gets on with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney in a justifiably nominated supporting role)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history. it is not a simple magic act either. Erin's got her character flaws (many of which are visited on supportive biker boyfriend George, played by Aaron Eckhart) and the lawsuit is immensely complicated, though Screenwriter Susannah Grant's nominated script keeps it all in focus and understandable. It's the kind of story we can all learn a lot from. Erin works her tail off,  polishes her own too harsh rough edges and ultimately wins a richly deserved reward (just the film itself was so amply rewarded.)It's a story that inspires americans to believe in the system and fight against corporate injustice on their own personal level.

While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine.",2008
9,Hallelujah for Julia Roberts. She was BORN to play this role! Erin Brockovich is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time! And I am VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT!,2000
10,"After all of the hype surrounding this film I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not! This film deserved to win Roberts the Oscar, her performance was superb. She plays the seemingly white trash Erin who may not have the qualifications but does not lack the intelligence. Through a simple research job she discovers that a large corporation has been poisoning the water supply of a town. She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement. It is not plain sailing for Erin as she has to overcome stereotypes and prejudice but she wins through in the end through her hard work and determination. Finney provides sterling support and his exchanges with Roberts provide some classic moments. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!",2001
8,"Based on a true story of tenacity and humble beginnings, this film follows Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in her stiletto-clad stumble through the challenges of scraping by to pay bills, raising her children and catering to the whims of whiny boyfriends. It is clear from the beginning what a haphazard balancing act Brockovich's life is, opening on her painfully awkward attempts to make a good impression through an unsuccessful job interview, where we learn that she is an unemployed single mother of three. Wallowing in her defeat only long enough to smoke a single cigarette, she makes her way back to her old orange car, which has since acquired a parking ticket, and almost predictably is T-boned at an intersection minutes after leaving.",2015

1,"One should head the warning that the movie is *based* on true-life events. ""Erin Brockovich"" is simply a ""lawsuits are really your friend"" feel-good Hollywood fluff movie that has little basis in fact. In real-life, an attorney that was retained by Hinkley residents to sue Brockovich and Masry after they took the money and ran, was quoted as saying ""I read the script; the only true part was Erin Brockovich's name.""",2001
10,"A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of people in `Erin Brockovich,' a movie based on actual events, directed by Steven Soderbergh. When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley, California, she uncovers information that PG&E may have been responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake, but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a mailman's trousers. 	Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it like it is and won't take `no' for an answer.  She captures ever grain of realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked the odds against her. She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor that he succeeds so well in doing so. 	The solid supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best movies of the year, `Erin Brockovich' is a well made, absorbing and entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",2000
10,"When I first saw this film I was jealous of Julia Roberts, she is soooo good! Second time I saw the film I was in complete admiration. Then I watched it again on video with my now husband. It was a special night. Now I've seen the film seven times since it came out. Why? Because it's poignant, funny, touching, moving and a true story. Julia Roberts hits every note and makes her character accessible to all. I truly feel I understand who Erin Brokovich is and what a daring, amazing person she is. I can't say enough about this movie except that it has made me appreciate living female heroes, movie-making and Julia Roberts all the more. Highly recommend watching!",2016
7,"First, I should explain that I have one of the lowest opinions of Julia Roberts imaginable.

1,"This film is simply trash, much like the woman it is about.  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a horrible movie.  Whoever thought that a woman with a bad taste in clothing, a vulgar mouth that spews obsceneties every time it opens, and continuous self-absorption could be the basis for a quality movie?  This movie tries to illustrate Erin Brockovich as a kind person with a good heart and will stop at nothing to help people and to make things right.  What a load of SH**!  Steven Soderbergh tries to fool us into believing that Brockovich is a good-natured woman trying to help the disease-striken residents within the area of PG&E.  Any wise viewer would look past this and see the truth, which is that Erin Brockovich is nothing but a bitch with a dirty mouth, a fraud, a dumbass, and not to mention a bad mother, which is well displayed when she leaves her children with a man she doesn't even know (George, who she treats like crap, even when they're together).  Another thing I couldn't stand about Erin was her selfishness and ungreatful, rude attitude that she displayed for her boss.  It seemed that every half hour she was asking for a raise, didn't seem to care when Masery was facing financial problems as a result of the lawsuit, and showed no respect for him at any point in the movie.  I guess she thought that she was the only one working her ass off in this whole thing.",2002
3,"Erin Brockovich - single mom, sexy, unscrupulous - the classic 90s hero (let's face it, this movie is definitely in the 90s genre of feminist films).  What is this film really about?  On the surface, it's about a courageous woman who stands up to a large corporation in defense of some three hundred clients who she cares for very much.  How touching.  But what is it really about?  This conventional film was trying to show that justice can and should be brought about in unconventional ways.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  Of course not.  That's what heroism is about - doing that which is extraordinary to achieve good ends.  But what exactly was the extraordinary thing that she did?  Was it the fact that she used her body as an object?  Or was it that she sacrificed precious time with her already-neglected children?  Or was it her rude and often dehumanizing way of interacting with other people?  What kind of hero is this? ",2000

The three leads are strong, if not great (especially Mr. Finney) >another 3 stars.  So what is wrong?  The film ultimately leaves a bad, bad aftertaste.  Even though this is a 'true' story, the way that Erin behaves in the movie is reprehensible ... she treats all of those around her like utter crap and puts words in their mouths (notice that NO ONE in the film says that they think she is stupid, yet notice how she accuses all of them of doing just that).  I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?  Because WE have three kids, couldn't keep a spouse around, and therefore we DESERVE to be able to do all this?  No friggin' way.  Julia, go back to NOTTING HILL.",2000
1,"One of the most awful movies I have ever seen, and certainly one of the most vulgar.

6,"This is the type of movie that puts me off Steven Soderbergh. I started to find interest in the guy earlier this year when Side Effects surprised me but it's half-assed efforts like this that just make me feel like his hearts not in it. Which is a real travesty on my part because the guy does his cinematography and editing as well as directing. Erin Brockovich is a bland slow film. It works on a simple and boring juxtaposition of a sexy young Mom doing legal work she's not trained to do. It's satisfying as she's driven by a need for justice but it's not as interesting as it thinks it is. Roberts is okay, good for her but not awards worthy. It feels like Oscar bait really, hitting all the checklist, but in mild quantities. There's just not enough meat on this film. Soderbergh keeps giving a little and thinks its enough. Perhaps I should rewatch Traffic, I know that's a complex film.",2013

Today we'll be looking at a very great family adventure, also one of the best Christmas films, THE GRINCH. This film reaches the pinnacle of family films and Jim Carrey makes a great choice by signing on to play the lead character. Though this film has a very poor score on this web site, I am here to tell you that this may be one of the most under rated film entry's of all time. This film is called ""terrible"", ""disgusting"" and ""not even funny!"" Now to that I have one word to say but that word is known as a swear word so I won't say it for such reasons as: I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE MORE REVIEWS. Anyway this film is a great motion picture and Ron Howard proves he still has a lot more life in him then some question. And so finishes my review on a great and funny film, The Grinch (2000)",2013
10,"If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation...oh well..but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you will love it..Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show. Try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ...",2004

Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period.",2004

1,"How?! This film is awful! A wonderful kids book should not be turned into a full feature length film! Dr Seuss must be rolling in his grave. The film is filled with bad jokes, Jim Carrey being annoying with one of the original messages getting completely jumbled up. The writers felt that it was necessary to put in A BUNCH of adult jokes that are sexual, gross and painful to watch when you realise that this is based on a kids book! While the Grinch himself looks fairly good, the Who's look like demons! They even act like demons! They are nothing like Suess envisioned them to be. They don't even act like the Who's from the original book! The settings (while fairly large) have bleak colours (colors if you're American) and some appear as fairly ugly. It rarely follows the book and when it does, you finally get a sense of relief. Then a gross joke is shoved in your face and you begin to despise this film even more. I don't understand how most people like this film. Jim ruins some of the scenes and it is just an awful film.",2013

8,"So whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes......This movie has really grown on me. I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. I saw the movies and owned the books as a kid and was given the books as a present in my 30's by my friend Amy Fidler. I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly, it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast/character depth and development. I have to admit, there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill. Bought it on the Playstation Network, can't wait to own it on Blu-ray. Narrater rocked it too.",2010
5,"This film had many things going for it: great original story, great cast, great potential for set and costume design, and great potential for makeup and special effects. Too bad Ron Howard didn't have the cohones or good sense to rein in Jim Carey's WAY OVER THE TOP performance or to get a better script. And this must be Ron's version of what a Tim Burton film should be, because much of the design is just plain creepy. While what had been a charming and heartfelt Christmas story here has turned into a frenetic, obnoxious parody of a holiday film now not fit for children. The original cartoon version is a MUCH BETTER version for children. Theodor Geisel (Dr. Suess) must be spinning in his grave somewhere and I can't imagine Mrs. Geisel (who approved this project on behalf of the Suess/Geisel estate) was thrilled with this film. So shame on you, Ron!",2007
1,"This movie was a disgusting, offensive, frivilous prostitution. Mean-spirited, superficial, and completely lacking any resemblence to the original story.  Has anyone ever READ the original story?  The point of Seuss' ""Grinch"" is not that the Whos are selfish weenies who learn how to be grateful after the Grinch steals all their Christmas.  THE POINT OF SUESS' GRINCH IS THAT THE WHOS ALREADY KNOW THAT MATERIAL GOODS ARE NOT THE POINT OF CHRISTMAS, AND THEY HAVE THE GIFTS AND GADGETS AS AN EXPRESSION OF WHO THEY ARE, ALREADY, INSIDE.  Jim Carrey is at his annoyingest; Ron Howard shows glaring deficiency in basic storytelling; and the general plot is gaudy and ridiculous, not to mention risque and offensive -- wife-swapping at the party?  The Who children brutally mocking and ostracizing the young Grinch?  The buxom Whoville sex-pot?  A ROMANCE STORY?  Give me a green latex make-up-covered break.  The sets, make-up, and camera work were obviously meant to be stunning and grand.  Instead they came across as exaggerated and trite.  The Grinch's bat-cave-like home?  The nauseating use of tilted camera shots?  And oh, wow, what great latex noses. Brilliant.",2002
1,"The live action Grinch is so over the top it makes the eruption of Vasuvius which burried Pompeii look like a tea candle. It has so much unnecessary slapstick ""humor"" that the 3 Stooges seem like the height of sophisticated humor. It is like getting hit in the face with a 100 lb sledge hammer. The delightful story we are used to is gone except for a few minutes near the end. The Whos are made out as stupid nit wits who are more interested in how much they can spend on gifts and what they will get in return that I really didn't care if the Grinch did steal Christmas. The only decent, feeling Who is the little girl, Cindy Lou. The young actress playing her is wonderful. The only other decent character is Max, the dog, and he steals the show. Jim Carry is NOT the Grinch. He is simply Jim Carry in a green fur suit with lots of make up. He does not know when to pull back and let the story work. He always goes way over the line. But this is also the fault of director Ron Howard. He could and should have made Carry pull back.",2000
1,"There's nothing more distasteful than a movie that helps perpetuate the very evils it supposedly tries to protest.  With this live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for instance, we have a movie that, like the original cartoon, tries to launch a thinly veiled attack on the American consumer culture.  But this movie is a product of the very same ridiculous excess that Seuss tried to discourage.  It is one of the most expensive movies of all time, to the extent that it may just barely turn a profit if it makes more money than any other movie this year, but a huge portion of its budget is completely wasted.  Why hire such expensive actors if you're going to hide them behind those awful rat-nose prosthetics?  Why hire the $20 million Jim Carrey and then render him unrecognizable with 40 pounds of latex (and do half his performance with CGI anyway)?  Why even make the movie in the first place with a script this grating and unbearable?",2000
1,"Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W. Bush is from rational, lucid thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.",2005

This comedy pushes the envelope in every aspect, and smiles proudly.  Tom Green, who gets a pretty small role, is the scene-stealer. Fans of him will be very impressed.  One moment that had me almost on the floor was the French toast scene with SNL regular Horatio Sanz.  I don't want to give away any of the comedy, because that would be a sin.  Just take my word:  You will love this movie!  You will not stop laughing!  This is one trip worth taking!",2001

Those films  included raunchy jokes, crude humour, nudity and they had the audacity to poke fun at everyone, call them the Quentin Tarantino of comedies.  Before American Pie, you had some ALMOST good films with Can't Hardly Wait and 10 Things I Hate About You.  They were good but not quite good enough to be mentioned in the same breath as Animal House and Porky's and such.  Then American Pie comes along and shows everyone that it is okay to have boobs again and to use the f-word liberally with lines like "" Sherman, what the f*** are you doing here?"" and "" Oz, F***face, I don't think he's coming back!""  This was a film that didn't try to imitate closely the way teens and young adults talk, it DID imitate the way teens and young adults talk.  Road Trip continues that trend.  Hollywood has to realize when it gives the green light to scripts that we are not as stupid as they think we are, in most cases.  And what I mean by that is simply, sure, it can make money off almost any excuse for a teen film like Drive Me Crazy and Here On Earth and such, but if you want to hit the jackpot, if you want young people to feel the need to see the film more than once and recommend it to their friends, you have to have a smart ear, likable characters to laugh at and more than just a simple boy meets girl story.

To be honest, it wasn't all bad, just the parts that Tom Green had anything at all to do with.  Mr. Green is as funny as Will Ferrell doing his taxes while watching ""Ishtar"" in a burning orphanage on the Titanic.  He is to comedy what Stephen Hawking is to comedy.  His brand of ""humor"" is for those people that use phrases like ""book-lurnin'"" and found ""Animal House"" and ""Police Academy"" far too cerebral and uppity.  His success can only be explained by way of speculation that he has made some sort of deal with Satan, undoubtedly that Tom will be given fame and riches, on the condition that he never set foot in Hell as I'm sure even Satan's standards for humor are higher than this.

Let the damned negative deteriorate, or incinerate it even! If this movie had no vulgarity, profanity, and crude sexual implications to support it, it would not have been a movie at all, which shows just how hollow the story and production really are. Now, I don't mind a film that would have any of these characteristics if it helps to supplement the realism of the story, but if those three things are all that the movie has to rely on, or if any of them are overused, the film will end up becoming ""crap-o-vision"", and this film qualifies as crap because it doesn't really have a story with any kind of depth, only a way to satisfy perversion. This film is not art, it is a repulsive waste.  If this film, and ""Scary Movie"" are any indications of the kind of direction the American cinema is headed towards, then we are producing ourselves to self-destruction.

But I definately wish they would come out with a sequal to this movie. I own this movie and actually watch it like once a week. I even bought the sound track. Also, I thought it was cool that the group of Road Trippers ventured off into the deep south and visited a black college campus. That was probably one of the funniest scenes in it. The guys may not look like Justin Timberlake but by the end of the movie women will definately come to lust over these characters.",2002

I noticed only one truly poetic touch. Amy Smart goes topless for a few seconds. Well, alright, as an actress she has only modest talent, but as far as this witless trip story goes that scene is a sine qua non. With it, you have a few seconds in which a very beautiful blond California surfer girl is without a top. Without it, you have a witless trip story.",2012

10,"Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office  (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim.  Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies.  It's no wonder, either, as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.",2001
10,"Traffic is an incredible movie. The director, Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape, out of sight, erin brockovich, etc...) has created a film that combines elements of Hollywood and independent filmmaking. On one hand, he has created an epic that has a very wide scope and has used some famous Hollywood actors. On the other hand, as the cameraman for the film, he has shot it with a handheld camera and and makes the film visually very different from traditional films. He presents the drug war in the United States from three perspectives. The first is of a police officer (superbly played by Benicio del Toro)in Tijuana struggling with the difficult situations that such a job creates in the center of drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the wife of the leader of a drug cartel in San Diego who gets arrested. Once naive about his business, she takes charge of the operations. The third story deals with the appointment of conservative Ohio Supreme Court justice Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas, to the post of drug czar. This occurs while his daughter Caroline, portrayed emotionally by Erika Christensen starts descending into a world of drugs thanks to her boyfriend Seth Abrahams. (Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show"" plays Seth) These three stories are distinguishable visually. The Tijuana story is shot with different tones of yellow, giving everything that goes on in the story a feel similar to that of a hot desert. The San Diego story has warm soft colors, representing Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta Jones' character) once peaceful social soccer mom life. Finally, Cincinatti and Washington, D.C., the cities where the story of the drug czar takes place is shot in a cold blue, giving it an emotionless feel. Despite the importance of the visuals, what makes this film that much better is the fact that Soderbergh does not moralize. There is not an anti-drug stance but there is also not a strong advocacy of legalization. Traffic shows a problem with no current solution. The viewer has to decide for himself. 10/10",2001
10,"The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll, demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. He's been America's most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade, and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost, it's a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s, when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than he's ever done before, bouncing several characters and plot-lines against and off each other, so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking, this is not an ""issues"" movie per se. Instead, it's a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. What's most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich, there's a graceful absence of self-importance and bombast in the presentation. However, this doesn't mean the film lacks a strong point of view.",2000
9,"A dazzlingly complex film, `Traffic' takes a hard, unflinching look at the so-called `war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture -- the users, the dealers, the police, and the politicians -- and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand.  In terms of story, direction, and characters, `Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years, period.",2001
9,"No compromises here.  Traffic takes a long, hard look at the narcotics industry in North America and manages to entertain at the same time. The triple plot allows you to see the whole industry with multiple perspectives. The movie is visually stunning, loved the different filters for the three locations.",2001
9,"Yep, I'm on a full Sodebergh binge. I've been crazy about him ever since ""King of The Hill"" and he, very rarely, lets me down. I couldn't say that about many people including siblings and lovers. ""Traffic"" is not a departure for Sodebergh, all of his films are. He is an artist with a golden touch. He can travel through opposing universes with amazing ease. In ""Traffic"" the universe is uncomfortable, muddy, almost ugly and yet, it fascinates and attracts with the power of a magic magnet. Benicio del Toro and Erika Christensen are the two inhabitants of this peculiar universe that get under your skin and carry with you as if they were part of a personal experience. No, not if. They do, they are, they become part of a personal experience. The film allows you that. It makes you learn without preaching. How many films today manage that?",2005
8,"Director Steven Soderbergh's latest film, ""Traffic,"" covers the US/Mexican War on Drugs-specifically, cocaine-from several different angles.  Three separate but interconnected storylines show dealers, users, cops, smugglers, lawyers, government officials-everyone but the South American growers.",2001

5,"The story of a conservative judge appointed to head US drug policy, intertwined with sub-plots involving his own daughter's drug-taking and the criminals actually producing narcotics at the other end, with a sub-plot of an initially innocent woman gradually taking over her husband's drug business. Most people seem to think this film is great. The reason I don't is because I've just seen the European version of Traffic, a TV movie made a year earlier, and it is SO much better. It's impossible not to make comparisons. Michael Douglas is excellent as always in the lead character and so was Peter Reigert (wasted in a small role) but that's about it. If only Catherine Zeta-Jones' talent could match her ambition. Her Welsh/South American accent is laughable. The worst aspect of this film is the superficial ""Disneyesque"" way it deals with Douglas' daughter's drug-taking. It's a joke. We don't see anything ""nasty"" and at the end she simply comes back to Daddy and gives up drugs. The Euro version really does show the filth and the squalor and the utter despair of a junkie as the young Oxford student drops out and descends into a life of thievery and prostitution to feed her habit. SO much more convincing. I'm annoyed by this movie because it was made later than the European version and had a much higher budget so it should have been better, and it simply isn't.",2005
9,"Not your usual thoughtless rubbish. Excellent storyline which I won't spoil. Brilliant cast, particularly like the cop duo of Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, boy does he have an eye for a good script. He also has an eye for a good woman...Catherine Zeta Jones is rather good in it also. Benicio Del Toro got all the praise he deserved for this film. It is what I like to call a ""well screwed together"" film. By that I mean all the storyline points have maximum effect due to the quality of acting, music and cinematography. Great use of Brian Eno's music, and effective use of colour filtering to convey mood. Just watch it and be absorbed.",2004
6,"This is an ugly story but still fascinating to watch, at least once. I'm not sure about more than twice, at least from my experience. It's too much of a downer to enjoy regularly but I do recommend a minimum of one viewing for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.",2006
1,"This movie further sustains the fact that no matter what role Douglas plays(with the exception of Falling Down), Douglas acts exactly the same. Its just like the same person with a different name and occupation. His facial expressions for every situation is the same, his actions and reaction for every role, every emotion, every situation that his character faces in every movie is the same. He is Steven Seagull without a pony-tail.",2001
7,"This movie is a summarical knockoff of the English version ""Traffik""; a miniseries from the mid 80s. The miniseries is MUCH better, although a little dated. Traffic omits really cool segments of the drug trade that ""Traffik""(English version) covers. If you ""really"" liked Traffic, then you will like ""Traffik"" even more. ",2012
1,"This had to be one of the worst movies that it has been my misfortune to spend money to see. The plot was poor and it was Booooooorrrrrrrriiiinnnnnggggg. My wife actually fell asleep several times during it. If I had been on the aisle, I would have walked out of it and asked for my money back. As usual, the Academy can be counted upon to put a piece of ""artsy-fartsy "" fluff to give the ""Best Picture"" nomination to instead of something that was worth the money. It is in the same class as the super-boring Schiendler's List with all sorts of color visual effects. A potentially good story and a talented cast wasted.",2001
1,"Now what have we gained from watching this film?  Nothing new.  In fact every aspect of this film is just a fabrication from someone or something else.  The writing was mediocre at best. The camera work, oooh it is jiggling how edgy. Please!  The acting was ok but nothing spectacular but that is a function of the writing.  This film tried so hard (too hard) to say something about a lot issues (via the perspectives of different sides involved in the 'drug war') but ended up saying nothing at all, well at least nothing new it was cliche after cliche.  I would rather watch Stargate then this abomination again, well maybe not but at least Stargate clocked in under two hours.  But hey this is just my opinion.",2001
1,"I have several issues with Traffic. 1) The idea that Catherine Zeta-Jones' character could get away with murder is not believable. There are several things that make this impossible. First, the killer she hired she was talking to her on the phone seconds before the car blew up. Clearly, there will be an investigation on the Federal Agent's death which would reveal that the last person the killer talked to was Catherine Zeta-Jones. 2) When the snitch actually does get killed, his security was a joke. You tell me you are going to let some guy serve him breakfast, who you don't even know who he is. People clearly wanted the snitch dead. Also, why is Don Cheadle's character protecting him? Isn't that the US Marshal's job? The snitch shot at Don Cheadle and Don Cheadle shot the snitch. So clearly they aren't going to make Don Cheadle the snitches protection. ",2011

1,"This hyped movie was a real dud. As an action movie it is dull, making drug dealing seem about as exciting as the paper clip industry. Several of the characters are unconvincing in their motivation (like the preppie honor student who becomes a crack whore). I agree with its advocacy of better rehab and treatment programs, but PBS Frontline does a more engaging job of presenting that POV. Stylistically it was stupid: How come Mexico is always yellow and brown, and Cincinnati blue? Very overrated!",2001
1,"This movie has a lot going on in it. Unfortunately it is difficult to relate to any of the many characters.

We need to rethink our system of award shows. Its just not working. And neither does this movie.",2001
10,"Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I've seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe ""Oh Brother,"" but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out.",2001
10,"The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on ""The Odyssey,"" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read ""The Odyssey"" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.",2001
10,"Having seen most of the Coen Brothers previous films I expected something different and slighty off centre.

It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.",2001

10,"Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing ""their thing"" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!",2001
10,"I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.",2001

Three depression era convicts(George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives.

10,"About the discussion on the South, the rednecks and the hillbillies... Well, I am from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole to be exact. Is this southern enough? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor lived the classic period of Homer, but he speaks to us today. So does Shakespeare and Dante. And stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like ""O Brother"". Besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too! And our own depression era (ever heard of Argentina during year 2001?), our politicians and racism, our gentle souls just like Delmar and Tommy... I simply loved this movie, folks. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And please forgive my errors in English, I tried my best)",2006

The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.",2006
10,"Another outstanding movie by the Coen Bros. While their style remains similar, there appeal can be hit and miss. This movie is right on target. This is a rare film that combines excellent casting, superb cinematography and well acted roles. And the best part about this movie is how much more your liking and respect for it grows the more you watch. Never before have I found myself so engrossed in a dialogue driven movie. Every viewing brings new laughs and exposes new subtleties that I was sure I caught. George Clooney firmly establishes himself capable of acting in a comedic role. Fans of Dennis Miller will certain appreciate the ""intelligent humor"" this movie provides and Coen Brother fans should have a new personal favorite. And a small suggestion from this end. If you didn't find it funny the first time, turn on the captions and grab a dictionary. You'll be rolling by the time the boys are ""in a tight spot!""",2005

Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****",2006
10,"Headline says it all really. I was a bit sceptical about going to see the film. Firstly the location was an 'Arty' cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an 'arty-farty' concept film, not made for the pleasure of the mass public, and a film to establish Clooney as more than a hearthrob. However, I read the review of the film, and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour, as it came thick and fast. I think that comment was meant for the Dutch, originating from the UK I had no trouble with following the film.",2001

No doubt the aforementioned hacks will all scream `Philistine' if and when they bother to read this particular review, but I for one found this film dull and tedious in the extreme. I found myself waiting for something momentous to happen but nothing really did. The whole thing just plodded along at snail's pace  uninspiring plot lines leading toward an equally uninspiring ending. By far the worst movie that George Clooney has ever been involved in. His character was obviously intended to be the brains of the trio alongside those two other dimwits, but the whole sorry bunch were just annoying and tiresome, GC included (and that accent - oh dear me). I usually enjoy movies set in the depression era and I sat down in eager anticipation to watch this one. The 30s backdrop and the atmosphere conjured up by the bluegrass soundtrack were perhaps the film's only saving graces. But the plot (such as it was) and the characters were just awful. I watched this movie with my wife and an American friend from the `deep south' and they too were bored out of their minds by it. Not worthy of all the hype, no way!!!",2001

It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way.

9,"I've always been intrigued with Daniel Defoe's ""Robinson Crusoe"", particularly the importance of the items that Crusoe salvaged from the shipwreck, items that Crusoe could not have made himself and which make his survival and the relative elegance of the life he built for himself quite plausible. The real-life inspiration for Crusoe was one Alexander Selkirk who, in 1704, choose to remain on one of the Juan Fernandez islands - four hundred miles from the Chilean coast - rather than continue on a voyage with a captain and on a ship he did not trust. Selkirk was left with bedding, a firelock rifle, some powder, bullets, tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, his mathematical instruments, and some books. Selkirk's four years on his own were a bit more austere than Crusoe's fictional life, in large measure because of his relatively meager stock of good quality tools. Selkirk also lost a lot of his social skills.",2005

Although I won't reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself. The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time.  I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through.  I say that every element of the film was perfect.  And for those of you who hate Wilson, you have to understand about how human he really was to Chuck. I was amazed on how well this movie was made and think that everybody should have an experience that should cause you to take stock of your life.

Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing.

10,This is one of the few films that really got me emotionally involved.I am not the type of person to cry when watching a movie but I found myself sensitively affected at the end of this movie.Courtesy of 'Robert Zemeckis' who really has a talent of emotionally drawing in the audience with his style of directing.One other thing that increased the success of the message behind this movie is the music score composed by 'Alan Silvestri' which is so sad at the times it does occur.,2014
9,"Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and, more importantly, a very special volleyball, a.k.a. my beloved Wilson. I love this movie because it's dramatic and inspiring but also because it's not utterly swamped down with swells of dramatic music. In fact, the whole time Hanks's character is on the island, there is no music, and this actually has a profound and unique effect. Don't get me wrong, I love a good soundtrack, but sometimes I think that there is definite overkill with music in scenes that don't necessarily need it.",2013
10,"If you are looking for a life-lesson, this movie stubbornly refuses to teach you anything.",2012
10,"Cast Away was Tom Hanks' second film with director Robert Zemeckis. The last time they collaborated was on the 1994 multi-Oscar winner Forrest Gump. I must admit I was never exactly a huge fan of Forrest Gump, despite being a great admirer of Zemeckis' work. It was a film that painted a rather naive portrait of America and its relationship with the common man. And the special effects (however impressive they might have been) were only a nifty selling-point to wow the Academy award winning crowd. One of the most commercially calculated and overrated films ever made.",2007
10,"I have seen this film 5 times. Recently got the Blue Ray version. I am not going to go into the narrative much. Others have done that already.

Tom Hanks, I praise you as the Jimmy Stewart of our time. C No land.",2013
10,"The film Cast Away centralizes its focus on a FedEx employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), who is the sole survivor of an airplane crash only to be stranded on an island that is drastically off-course. Throughout Chuck's extended stay on the deserted island he battles isolation, depravity, and the will to survive. After Chuck realizes he may never be found he battles the island both emotionally and physically in hopes of one day seeing his lover Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) again. Even though Chuck is faced with disparaging odds, he manages to accomplish great feats while maintaining his sense of humor and his drive to survive. ",2017
8,"The movie tells the story of a Fed-Ex worker, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whom find himself, away from his normal life with his love one, Kelly (Helen Hunt) when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island. Chuck has no choice, but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment, and find the courage to escape his island dwelling, when he's able to. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the structure of this film is divided into three parts: Chuck's life as a FedEx employee, the struggle to survive on the island, and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change. Each one has this 'show, don't tell', modality of storytelling. The movie doesn't have that much dialogue, which in my opinion works. This allows the beautiful, yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film's story. The way, the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work, show how Chuck Noland's lives life under the punctuality of a running clock. The way, Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen, show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is, where time doesn't really matter anymore. I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning, to slow, near one location standstill. The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch. Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin. It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island, and return back to normal home. Again, this could symbolizes, how much driven, he is at his job. It's really up to debate, what this item was really about or what's in it. Glad, they didn't use the deleted scene from the script that actually has Chuck open the box. It would had kill the movie for me. Another symbol is that of Wilson, the volleyball. The character was created by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. while researching island survival techniques in a beach in Mexico, in which this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. While, talking to a volleyball might seem weird on paper, it makes a lot of sense, as it show, how much people are willing to go for a sense of normal connection, when isolate from others. From a theatrical POV, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation. The movie really does makes a good job to it seem like Wilson, could be a person. In my opinion, he's the most famous inanimate object, put on film. It was heart-breaking, what happen to him, toward the end. Only Tom Hanks can make us feel something for a volleyball, and make it seem believably. In any lessor actor, this might come across as silly or boring. This movie is very engaging, because of him. Tom Hanks is a master of showing great range of emotion with his facial features and the way, he moves his body. You can tell, how much trauma, he went through, the way, he looks at things, or how he reacts. Not only that, Hanks went through, great stress to get his body ready for the role. Hanks gained 50 pounds during pre-production to make him look like a pudgy, middle-aged man. After a majority of the film was shot, production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his beard. He look like he had been living on the island for years. This was a very extreme weight lost, that might cause a lot of Tom Hank's health problems in later years. Hanks even was nominated for Best Actor that year for a Oscar. While, Helen Hunt isn't in the film, much. She did a great job as a supporting role. You really can tell, the struggle, she has, with trying to love Chuck, while also trying to move on. The film gives fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone. It's somewhat educational. I like how the movie begins and ends at crossroads. Two possible paths to an unknown future. It's all very symbolic. This movie has a lot of replay value. There are tons of little clever things that change into the timelines of the movie, you can only pick up on, if you watch it, a few times, such as how Chuck wears his shoes, during airplane flights, the irony of the dentist that cause him so much pain or the name of the ranch where the angel wing package came from. Then, there are those slight things, that foreshadow a lot of what will happen, later on the film such as seeing Chuck's sailing certification or the off comment mention of a tooth ache or the song 'Return to Sender' playing the background. While, the movie doesn't have that much music. Alan Silvestri's minimal score was beautiful to listen to, and good enough to win a Grammy Award in 2002. I like how he use nature sound effects to reinforce the feeling of isolation with his music. The weird product placement didn't really hurt the film. This film features a Fed-Ex cargo plane crashing in the Pacific Ocean, but it didn't hurt the company, as the film's success ensured help increased brand awareness. One thing that kinda did, hurt the film, is the trailer that really did spoiled too much. Seriously. Don't watch the trailer until you've seen the film. I like how the film, later helped developed the show, Lost. Overall: A great movie that showcase the triumph of the human spirit under harsh conditions. It's brutal, haunting and painful, yet compelling, enigmatic, & uplifting. This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.",2015
9,"Cast Away is a fantastic movie with an extremely well written and well developed storyline and a very talented cast (mainly just one cast member).I was very impressed with atom Hanks in this film,he proved that he can be a good actor even without have other actors around him,for the majority of this film he is the only person on screen,as we watch him stranded on an island as he loses his mind,Hanks stays dramatic and convincing all the way through.I was so impressed that the films script actually got me to feel for a football,Tom Hanks character starts communicating with a ball he calls Wilson because of it's brand,and after a while this character becomes ""his friend "" and it is only this man really has,and because of that I actually felt emotion for this lifeless ball,I was so impressed with the writers,Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for managing to do this.Cast Away is an outstanding drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers.",2014

Without basic modern comforts and fighting solitude daily, Noland must live in hope that one day he might be saved before he loses his mind or the will to live.",2009
9,"My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed. Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film, we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island. However, even with that said, the previews didn't really spoil the movie. Though it would have made the message(s) that much more powerful if they didn't give that much of it away. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland; A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place. Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend / fiancé, Kelly, who is very understanding of Chuck Noland's plight. One day, just before Christmas, Chuck is called away to Malaysia. This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane (most realistically) crashes into the ocean. As the only survivor, he washes up on shore of a small, isolated island in the south Pacific. This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character. On the surface, Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to; He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level, and a girlfriend he is completely in love with. His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash. Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival. There are no cuts to the rescue efforts, no ""meanwhile, back in Memphis"" scenes. It's all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film. There are four basic needs of survival. Most people know about the first three: Food, Water and Shelter. Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need, which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls ""Wilson"". The acquisition of food, water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs. We suffer with him as he does his own dental work. This goes on for four years... Finally, one day a piece of metal (from the plane?) washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape. He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island. He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued. Along the way, he losses his only friend of the last four years, Wilson, in a strange but very emotional scene. Shortly thereafter, on the brink of death from dehydration, he is rescued. In any other movie, this would be the happy ending. But this is not any other movie. Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life. And now he must find a way to move on with his. When he first arrived on the island, he only needed to find ways to physically survive, but now rescued, he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him. The final scene, just before the credits roll, reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie. This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering, pain, or tragedy that someone may go through, their life will always be worth living. And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience. This is a moral and spiritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another.",2008

8,"Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).",2000
10,"To work, comedy has to be unexpected. And that is just what makes ""The Replacements"" work so well. Oh, not that the storyline is unexpected, for from it. But the actual comedy embedded in that plot is often delightfully quirky and quite unusual in this extremely good-natured and entertaining film. The very first scene, for example, takes place in a completely unexpected setting and proceeds in a really odd-ball way.",2000

With all the extremely dramatic, be it important, films being made lately (Life is Beautiful,etc), it's nice to watch a film that is just entertaining.  The supporting cast was amazing, as an ensemble they worked together as a team should.  And Keanu Reeves gave a wonderful performance - he is often under appreciated as an actor because he is attractive - but he gave a solid performance.  Gene Hackman was good - that goes without saying, but I think this is the first time I've ever seen him portray a character I actually liked.",2001

BOY was I suprised! This was a really funny, really sweet movie that made me laugh and laugh. Keanu's acting was better than I've ever seen, the supporting cast did a GREAT job. I go to a LOT of movies, and it has been a long while since I've seen a movie that i enjoyed this much, so I really encourage you to give it a try.",2000

I went to see a sneak preview, so it didn't really matter to me if it was going to be good, because I didn't have to pay for it. Well, I would pay to see it again!! Not only is this movie beyond funny, real funny, the story is terrific, acting wonderfully strong , the dialogue so real, and it leaves you wanting more. Gene Hackman can do anything, so him playing a coach, and choosing him for the role was right on the mark. Keanu Reeves, what can I say. He's so easy on the eyes. ALL you want to do is watch him play the role as quarterback, (as if he was one), and enjoy looking at him being ""FALCO"". The chemistry between him and Annabell is so cute & mushy. It's a movie for anyone who wants to laugh, is rooting for the under dog, likes football or not, or who just wants to go to a movie and be completely entertained!! W.B. has truly captured what it is we all go to the movie for.

You want fun, mindless entertainment, check this out. Props to Keanu Reeves for learning to throw like a genuine quarterback.",2000
9,"""The Replacements"" is more than an ""it does for football what ""Major League"" did for baseball"" kind of movie.  ""Replacements"" is funnier than that film, for one thing. It's more in the league of ""Slapshot"" with Gene Hackman providing the weight that Paul Newman brought to that film. Also, like the hockey scenes in ""Slapshot,"" the actual football sequences are really bone crunching. While there is a lot to look at in ""Replacements,"" like Keanu Reeves (who is also really good in this role, playing it for drama amid all the wackiness) getting the hell beat out of him, or like the replacement cheerleaders carted in from local strip clubs to really get the fans pumped for the game (is this what the XFL is going to be like?), this movie works as more than all that stuff.  More than the sum of it's parts, as they say. ""Replacements"" has a good heart. Bottom line, I'm going to see it again.",2000

The last movie that was close to this was ""Major League"" which this was very similar to, but there were some aspects that made this better. It was the most unique roll I have ever seen Gene Hackman in and it was a very refreshing one at that. Even the music set the tone perfectly. You will love the closing, naturally I do not want to give it away but the music in the closing scene of the movie was just perfect in setting the mood and emotion. I could watch it over and over.",2001

However, never have I wasted the money to see any of these horrible movies in a movie theatre-until now. There was nothing positive about this movie. It wasn't funny. The plot flopped in the first 20 minutes. The acting was mediocre. Originality and a decent dialogue seemed to be missing. And worst of all it seemed to never end.

3,"This film is actually quite amazing in two ways.  First, there is the use of the cliche.  I wracked my brain trying to think of some sports movie cliche that they missed using, but could not think of a one.

8,"In the tradition of SLAPSHOT and THE LONGEST YARD, THE REPLACEMENTS was a charming and laugh-out loud sports film about a group of scabs for an on strike, fictional pro football team brought together by a long out of work coach (Gene Hackman) and long ago disgraced quarterback (Keanu Reeves) coaxed into a comeback. There's nothing new or original here and the film is, for the most part, pretty predictable, but what makes the film special is the presence of Gene Hackman and the stylish professionalism he brings to the role of Jimmy McGinty. Hackman underplays the role so beautifully and allows the over the top performances by Jon Favreau and Orlando Jones among others, to shine in the appropriate moments without ever allowing himself to be pushed in the background. Hackman is so adept at doing this that you don't even see him doing it. The casting of Hackman as Jimmy McGinty was a stroke of genius because it brought an element of class and charm that would have otherwise have been missing and made this just another slapstick sports comedy, but Hackman's presence and charisma takes the film to a more quality level.",2005
2,"The Replacements (2000): Dir: Howard Deutch / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Jon Favreau: Same old junk with a different paint job. It suggests ignorance on behalf of those whom the team will eventually prove wrong. Gene Hackman plays a football coach who decides to assemble a team of players who have dropped out of sight. There is a football strike and he views this as an opportunity for others to shed their light. Among these are a maniac cop, a convict, a gambler who can kick, two big black bar bouncers, a sumo wrestler, etc. Keanu Reeves is sought after as a quarterback. He served a nasty defeat but Hackman still sees potential. Recycled and dreary with director Howard Deutch doing his best but after making The Odd Couple 2 he needs all the help he can muster. He also directed Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful (which doesn't describe this film). Hackman is wasted as the coach who will whip these players into shape. Orlando Jones is far too talented to be stuck in a film that requires no thought. Brooke Langton's role is obvious in that she is basically a romantic prop. While Varsity Blues made this same sort of film entertaining and funny, here is a film so deserving to be toss onto a football field so that it might be stumped on by every single player. The screenplay is in bad need of replacing. Score: 2 / 10",2015

7,"I don't know much about American Football, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this film. Whilst it is primarily a sporting comedy - and there's a lot of laughs - it also has some serious point and Gene Hackman's presence adds gravitas. Apparently Reeves took a substantial play cut to get Hackman in the film and there's good chemistry (father/son) between the two. Reeves plays the film for drama and character and does a good job, bringing his famed physicality and dedication to character with incredibly dry humour (lovely comedy timing when he gets grass in his grill). The majority of the laughs come from the antics of the rest of the team, especially Rhys Ifans as the ""wiry"" Welsh chain smoking kicker, and Jon Favreau the SWAT team psychopath! Great physical comedy and for an adult film with a high-school peer pressure feel, it's suitable for young adults with not too much bad language and the love interest doesn't resort to explicit bedroom antics despite having a Hollywood leading man. Reeves was well cast - quiet, a commanding presence and perfectly happy throwing himself around. Gene Hackman of course was brilliant, dry and witty and the perfect coach to a bunch of wannabe, has been, washed up ""scab"" football players called in during a players strike. Brooke Langton (head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell) was really convincing and sweet. All great performances and despite it being predictable and a little cheesy it's great feel-good watching.

Bought the DVD, and just can't stop re-watching it rather often. and I wonder why...it's not only the soundtrack. not only the clichés. not only the oh-so-predictable plot. actually, if one has seen a few sports movies , already knows the whole plot/action/scenes in advance... maybe it's the simple and enjoyable fun... OK, not the most intelligent type of humor, but at least it's got its moments... and the whole cast is just too fit for the movie. ",2006

I bought an American DVD copy and think it's the most entertaining comedy I have seen in years.

Not being  biased in anyway, I think rising Welsh star Rhys Ifans puts in an excellent performance as Gruff and I loved the humour about the character he plays being Welsh. It's about time the U.S adknowledged the fact that the U.K makes up 4 countries and is not just England!!! The rest of the cast is excellent too, the performance of the movie has to go to John Favreau who totally steals the show as the crazy SWAT team leader who floors anyone that's in his way.

Of course all of those special abilities are visible in the film's spectacular special effects. But the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun. There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers.

Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit ""safe,"" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you're an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it!

There is not a better Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, and I cannot imagine Dougray Scott , who was the first choice to play Logan, in Hugh's place. Patrick Stewart and James Marsden have both a big resemblance with the characters they play as well.",2006
10,"This film was awesome! It's the first installment in a series of adaptations from the classic comics to bring the beloved comic heroes to life and the director achieves this with such cinematic kudos! The film begins with the character Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) struggling to come to terms with what he truly is, but not for long we start getting introduced to the other characters as well, at least the ones who haven't checked themselves into the Xavier school for the gifted yet. We are introduced to a young Rogue (played by Anna Paquin) who is so frightened by her special powers and what it does to the people around her that she runs away from home. Sooner than later, she meets up with Wolverine (actually she hides in the back of his truck) and he inadvertently allows her to tag along with him. The chemistry between the two is blazing but weird since Anna is so young and Hugh is very much older. Along the way, they are attacked by Sabretooth and now know that it is imperative that they find the Xavier school which they eventually do. While there the meet a slew of gifted X-men and team up with Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) to help stop the evil Magnetto (Played by Sir Ian Mckellen).",2006
8,"I've never heard of this comic before and I hate comics in general, but I enjoyed this movie. I think some people are losing it a little with their big wraps of ""X-Men"" though. It can surely only be described as a good fun movie that's not to be taken very seriously. Still Hugh Jackman was awesome and it managed to entertain me, and that's all I was after.",2000
1,"Was ""The Usual Suspects"" a fluke?  Bryan Singer turns in a decidedly B-movie job directing this flat, predictable comics adaptation.  It's almost too faithful to its original medium, with 2-d performances from all the principals except for Hugh Jackman (as the grouchy Wolverine, he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cut-outs).  Patrick Stewart is lifeless.  Ian McKellen, who was believably dark in Singer's ""Apt Pupil,"" here only looks very drowsy.  And the X-Men themselves look like the cast of ""Dawson's Creek"" in drag.",2000
10,"When this movie came out, comic book movies were down on their @$$es. The last big comic book movie until then was ""Batman and Robin"", so basically: the genre was dead and killed. It was no other movie than X-Men that re-ignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny, goofy and cheesy at all.",2014
8,"It's very rare for a movie to live up to the claims made about it by publicity and in articles prior to its release; even GOOD movies often fall short.  But by George X-MEN does deliver the goods right down the line. It's made in a straightforward, basically realistic style, with superpowers taken for granted and, thankfully, not >explained<. If this isn't our world, it's the one next door.  I loved the first Tim Burton BATMAN, but it takes place in its own dark universe; the Richard Donner SUPERMAN (and Donner was involved in X-MEN, too) has some problems, but its big, sweeping, almost pastoral approach was just right.  Singer does X-MEN differently, but just as legitimately.  It's one of the best super-hero movies ever made, and the best big-studio movie this year -- easily.",2000
1,"How is this a good movie?  Maybe if you were into the comic books, a movie of it would seem like a cool thing, and then you just don't want to admit that the movie is pretty bad.  It was not an engaging story at all after they left Poland in the beginning.  You kept expecting something that would to grab your attention, but it never came.  The ending was pretty lame, and it seemed like the last 3rd of the movie was just setting up for the sequel. I never really understood what the story was.  I was expecting much better things.  Too bad for Bryan Singer after doing two very good movies (or at least one very good, then one not-quite-as-good)",2000

10,"Unbelievably, I have recently learned that some people don't like this first movie very much. I don't know why, because I did not want to learn, I will just write what I think. X-Men is the best one in the series including X-Men Origins Wolverine by far, even if the second one is deeper and it comes from perfect direction mostly. The movie is very consistent, no uneven material it has at all, it is very stylish and very enjoyable also. The tone, the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book or/and the animation, it is like Bryan Singer creates his own X-Men world, but somehow, it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment. Visually, it looks like a thriller rather than a (colorful) fantastic super hero movie, but this works somehow. Personally, I did not complain about it. Instead, it makes the movie eccentric, idiosyncratic. I like the snowy shots and despite it is short, one of the best action scenes of the movie, the fight after the accident. As for Magneto, Ian McKellen was made for Magneto (and of course for Gandalf too) As I know, some people complained about Sabretooth, but may be even if he was not made for the character like McKellen, Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Halle Berry as Storm, Tyler Mane looks great as Sabretooth. I saw the original character, I watched the animation, but I don't know why they were not satisfied with Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, what was wrong? He is as harsh as the original character too. Halle Berry is so cute by the way. There are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to Magneto by the way, I liked it. The action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite. Just a note: there is a shot with a weird angle, it was amazing. Visually, X-Men is one of the most stark, plain movies ever made probably. The last parts are amazing too, we see some cool fight scenes, everyone encounters with each other. Every time it is so fun to watch thanks to Singer's stark, eccentric direction and the colorful characters. The Wolverine Sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie, but better than X-Men Origins Wolverine. On the Statue of Liberty, there is a spiral camera shot, loved! And X-Men has much more.",2010
1,"This movie tries to be an action movie and an intelligent movie but fails dismally on both counts. The so called intelligent parts to the paper thin plot were extremely weak and never really got past the ""we shouldn't pick on those who are different to us"" message. As for the action, it was drawn out, predictable, relied too much on special effects and lacked any sort of suspense. Also, for most action type movies to work we need to at least care a little bit about the ""good"" characters and hate the ""bad guys"". Quite frankly, I didn't care who won or lost thanks to the almost non-existent character development.",2002

I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. ",2004

8,"I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.",2006

9,"The final plot twist  in ""The Sixth Sense"" made me wonder whether its director could repeat such a stunt, in ""Unbreakable"". Force us to follow the path he wants us to take, by telling his story, slowly, subtly leading us. Make us start to believe we know what will happen next, make us love the characters, then make us *want* things to happen next. Yes, tonight when seeing ""Unbreakable"", all that happens, again. And then, exactly like in ""The Sixth Sense"", he pulls the carpet right from under us, in the final seconds of the movie takes away everything, every expectation, he first gave us. Many people will be so disappointed by this that they will end up hating the movie. So did I, for about five minutes. Now I know the movie will make me think, literally move my thoughts, for a long time after tonight. I want to see it again, right now. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Hollywood has a new master storyteller. His name is Manoj Night Shyamalan.",2001
9,"An hour and a half into this movie I wondered how Shyamalan would wrap the film up in a nice little package, without room for a sequel. I shouldn't of bothered. The film was superb and the ending was a bigger twist than The Sixth Sense. Anybody who doesn't get Unbreakable should stick to Disney films. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act. Most of the plaudits for Sixth Sense went to the kid and Twelve Monkeys to Pitt, although Jackson is superb as usual, Bruce Willis steals the movie with a subtleness most screen stars cannot portray. Unbreakable is a great way to start off what should be a fine year for movies.",2001

1,"I loved the Sixth Sense, and I was really looking forward to Unbreakable. Maybe that was why I hated it so much--my expectations were way too high. When the movie ended, I turned to the woman next to me and asked ""What the heck was that all about?""  Her response?  ""Beats me.""  The movie starts with an interesting premise:  a man lives through a train wreck.  He's the sole survivor, and he doesn't have a scratch on his body.  In pops Samuel Jackson, who tells our hero that he, in fact, IS a ""hero.""  He's like a comic book superhero, he's just never known it.  Yep, you read correctly. He's a superhero.  Then, our ""hero"" decides to dress in a trenchcoat and save a kidnapped girl.  Huh? He tromps around, gets the living crap beaten out of him, but still beats the villain because, as the title suggests, he is literally unbreakable.  The movie ends with another ""twist"" like the Sixth Sense, but this one is much less effective.  Many people enjoyed this movie.  I guess you either go with it or you don't once Bruce Willis realizes he's a modern day Superman.  I, for one, certainly DID NOT.",2001

The talk about heroes and comic books was ludicrous and infantile at best. Willis had some good moments but the depression thing is not suitable for him, he was lifeless and zombielike and both he and his wife appeared to suffer from a Major Depression while the son apparently freaked out and showed also some alarming psychiatric symptoms. I really cannot understand how a film was made out of all this rubbish. I'd also like to confess a terrible secret: I din't like 6th Sense either. This is a Money-back situation for me.",2004

1,"Great idea.They could have had a classic here where in which the subject of stronger than usual individuals in our everyday reality (the best athletes,soldiers etc.) could have been explored and mirrored with that of the comic book genre writing.Oh the possibilities for that one!But they messed it up!If they wanted a movie that had Willis with paranormal qualities,they should have done this with more action.If they really wanted to make a movie basically for the plot twist in the end,they should not have indicated too blatantly that Willis had paranormal powers.They should have kept us guessing to the end although tend to keep the audience leaning toward the opinion that he MAY have powers,so this way,we can be fooled along with Willis and come to realise he is not as super as Jackson claimed he was.We were all carried away by the insane Jackson.Now that would have been more like it.But no!They showed us those very clear cut scenes of Willis displaying more than your run of the mill Michael Jordan abilities,keenly stating that Willis did indeed have paranormal superhuman abiities.No question about that fact.This mistake really watered down the intended ""realisation"" plot twist in the end.Still entertaining though and the acting was superb.But it breaks my heart thinking of what this movie could have been like without that simple mistake.......",2000
1,"I'll say it right now, Unbreakable is my pick for worst movie ever made. Not necessarily in terms of quality, I'm sure some Sci-Fi channel movie would snatch that prize, but in terms of writing, acting, and most importantly, directing. I counted how many words Bruce Willis said throughout the entire movie, my final total was 6 (that is not technically true as I didn't really count, but I'm confident my estimate is within about 10 of the actual number). There is an unbelievable amount of epic staring at each other done by all of the characters involved. I really wanted to enjoy this movie when we popped it in, in fact it was my choice to rent it, but by the end everyone in my family was laughing quite hysterically (needless to say the movie was not supposed to be funny). I do not enjoy when a movie is filled with dumb characters, in fact I really hate it when it seems every character is mentally deficient. This is one of those movies. One scene in particular struck me as incredibly ridiculous. Bruce's son decides he's going to shoot Bruce to show everyone that Bruce is truly invulnerable. Bruce and his wife freak out (naturally) and try to get the son to put the gun away. In a moment of unintentional comedy, myself and two other members of my family all said out-loud, ""For God's sake, just shoot him."" The movie would have been over and this horrible scene would cease to poison our minds with contagious stupidity. The big twist at the end was not clever, and relatively easy to predict, meaning of course that it was disappointing and therefore fit great with the rest of the movie. If you are someone who can REALLY get involved in a movie and truly feel the character's pain. then perhaps you will love this movie, but my entire family just couldn't get over how ridiculous everything was and how everyone kept staring at each other in an unbelievably corny way. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are looking for a comedy, cause after all, I found this movie quite hilarious in a pathetic sort of way.",2008

1,"A germ of a good idea gets buried under a script that needs many rewrites and a director quite impressed with himself. If slow pace worked so well in Sixth Sense, why not make this one twice as slow? Won't that make it twice as good? No. When action does occur, it often occurs with no sense of internal logic. Such as when the son suddenly points a gun at his father to show that Pops is a superhero. This comes out of nowhere. Also, Willis's catatonic performance worked well in Sixth Sense because he had a stunningly good child actor to fill the gaps. Here Willis isn't surrounded by that talent level. Why does he do the things he does? Why is he numb to everything? I don't know, and halfway through this mess, I didn't care. Avoid at all costs.",2001
1,This movie was dull - The personalities were dull; the lighting was dull; the color was dull; the acting was dull and the story line was BORING. Please explain something to me....the main-woe-is-me character works in security.

I sat through this comic because I needed a ride home but believe me I'd never read it.,2000
10,"When this show first debuted right after THE SIMPSONS, I incorrectly thought it was just a live action knock-off of the Simpson family. While there are some similarities, the show managed to carve out a unique niche for itself due to the show's wonderful ability to tell two or three stories simultaneously and interweave them so well. Plus the humor involving this very dysfunctional family managed to be unique enough that I honestly can't say it was like any other show on television. Excellent writing, casting and enough bizarre plot twists to keep you interested, it's not surprising this show lasted seven seasons. In fact, considering how FOX moved the show around so much, it's a testament to the quality of the show that this didn't kill it--as so often happens when they move shows around without consideration for the audience. In the end, when it was canceled, the show was STILL well written and going strong--and could have perhaps gone on for another season or two.",2007

Cranston turns Hal into a boy at heart (as all fathers are) - only, like everything else with the show, extends it into a complete satire and goes completely wacky. This show, for lack of a better word, is crazy.",2005

The writing is amazing, the acting incredible and the characters have been mined from pure gold. I agree and disagree with the comparisons to the Simpsons. The shows are definitely on a par in terms of smarts and humor and the way the plots develop from seemingly random happenings are definitely similar. But to my mind the difference is in the way the jokes are presented: the Simpsons writers pummel you in the gut with punch after hilarious punch while the Malcolm writers hold your head and force you to watch while they cringe-fully punch each other.

10,This is one of my all time favorite TV shows.,2010
10,"(I decided to review this after i saw some overly anticipated reruns on Nick at Nite.) This show revolves around a rude, disorganized, and uncivil family. This show could have been a horrible sitcom in so many ways, but it was BRILLIANT. the story writers are either Einsteins or freaks of nature. Each plot in each episode has such a great finish or a plot twist that it leaves you satisfied like no other TV show can. There is no ickiness in this show, and frankly, the show has a sharp feel good feel rather than a polite, soft-edged dull TV show with no plot. Now let's focus on the acting. The performance of the actors are amazing. The real star of the show is, in my opinion, little Dewey. He doesn't have that cheesy feel even older actors have. (cough cough iCarly) All the characters in Malcolm in Middle are top notch actors. nothing less in the best. So overall, this is one of the best TV shows I saw in my life.",2009
10,My feeling are generally extreme but this is one best written and worked out TV shows I have watched. Each episode starts off with a quirky incident which are really witty and funny. It lasts for over a 2 to 3 minutes only. They being able to come up with something quirky in every episode for 7 seasons is definitely a achievement in itself. They were able to maintain consistency in the script and make us relate with each of the characters to such an extent that we attach ourselves to their fictional day to day schedule was a amazing achievement. I love this series and would never get bored even if I have to watch it altogether again at a stretch on any day!,2014

I don't just love the show because its funny also because i can relate to the family I'm the middle child, we r in trouble with money I'm one of the kids know one likes because I'm smart.

10,"I watched it for the first time when I was 14 years by the summer of 2007. I love the premise of a live action adult oriented sitcom that centers around an 11 year old gifted child with a very eccentric and dysfunctional family. An overbearing strict mother, a childish father, an absent older brother (in military school), a second older brother who is a moronic thug (with a passion for cooking), and a younger brother who maybe as smart as Malcolm and can outwit his older brothers and family. I love the production values of the series. The production setup. The choice of filming techniques. The cinematography. The incidental (and often humorous) music and choice of songs. The (very rare) widescreen format (sometimes seen in syndication on FX). The writing. The acting. The irreverent, immature, witty, clever, and outrageous humor. And I love the characters. The only show where you care about all the characters, you can't say which character is your favorite because you love them all. FOX had a true classic that should have waited until now to be released to televisions everywhere. Now I missed out watching it on it's original release dates. But soon someday, the series will return on DVD and Blu Ray. This is a masterpiece that SHOULD be remembered in every household just like The Simpsons and Married With Children. Everything in this show is completely perfect. I don't see a flaw in any frame (except the episode ""The Red Dress"").

The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand.

8,"The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.",2001

6,"Upper middle-class mockney Guy Ritchie virtually remakes his previous hit LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,but this time with a larger budget,the addition of a Hollywood big-name (Brad Pitt),and even more flamboyant surface style than before.But this does not disguise the excessively complicated plot,the rather glib characterisations (not enhanced by jokey,Runyonese monikers),and the undoubted emptiness that lies beneath Ritchie's directorial excesses which threatened to get out of hand on LOCK STOCK;it certainly goes several miles overboard in SNATCH,which is to the film's considerable detriment.It is quite obvious that Ritchie is impersonating such American filmmakers as Scorcese and Tarantino (who himself has always been somewhat derivative of other directors,and judging by his recent efforts seems to be running out of the ideas he once had),though the gangster epics made by the aforementioned had far more style,depth,wit and conviction about them.Ritchie's closeted,wealthy background means that his essay in low-life criminality comes across as a caricatured,stylised fantasy,which admittedly is slick and very fast-paced,but lacking in the slightest bit of profundity.He may think his various directorial flourishes which he frequently employs here (and to a somewhat lesser extent in LOCK STOCK) are clever and the epitome of innovation,but they are actually anything but;merely designed to cover the obviousness of the plot,they rapidly become wearisomely flashy,and so resistibly self regarding as to become monstrous and indeed wholly pointless and unnecessary;subtler and quieter directorial techniques would've been much more credible and effective.",2008

4,"""Snatch"" is a British English-language film from 2000, so it is already over 15 years old. The writer and director is Guy Ritchie and this film came out shortly before he married Madonna. The cast includes many known names, such as Oscar winners Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, action film superstar Jason Statham, the late Dennis Farina and former football player Vinnie Jones. This 105-minute is as fast as it gets for a film and this is certainly not to everybody's liking (including myself). I found the camera work (i.e. the constant switches and movements) fairly distracting. The characters are all very much in your face, so Ritchie and the actors definitely wanted to make sure you remember them. But how about writing them properly instead? Giving them interesting background stories and making them memorable this (much more subtle) way? Now that would be something wouldn't it? And that also certainly requires much more skill when it comes to writing screenplays compared to just letting everybody shout at each other for the entire film, even if the path Ritchie took at least resulted in a handful fairly memorable quotes.",2016
5,"I really looked forward to watching Snatch. Not only was it from the director of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', one of my favourite UK movies of all time, but it had Brad Pitt in, who since Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club is my numero uno cool actor.",2000
4,"That's the only way I can explain these rave reviews and 8.2 average. Because if you come into the movie actually looking for a great story with great acting and diverse, interesting characters, well, you won't get it.

So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.",2010

Benicio del Toro was a big disappointment as a leading cast for his mere cameo appearance, and a lousy one at that.",2002

At the opening he was just 300 years old starship captain stuck at the edge of the black hole. Later we find out that he is special, and soon after that that he is a member of an ancient race. Also at the opening main characters were equal, an later there is only Hercules, sorry Capt Hunt and every one else is nothing more then a sidekick.

The plots didn't make any sense, it was just gun fights for no apparent reason, and there isn't a bad guy out there who can aim worth anything. Thats it thats all there is to it in the end. I could end this comment right here however the site posting rules want me to print at least 10 lines of text. Well here you go I'm typing some more text and I should repeat that Andromeda was fun in the first couple of episodes, and there seemed to be some sort of interesting back story to the whole thing but beginning in the second season, it lost touch with all of that possible storyline and became a senseless gunfight occurring over and over again and again.",2006

A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable.

When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul's disappearance and interviews Bateman.

There's two problems with this , firstly that it holds up the main plot of a violent serial killer bumping people off and secondly it doesn't connect with people like me who didn't spend a massive fortune on expensive brand products in the 1980s ",2005

The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate ""mergers and acquisitions"" industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick.

Audience does not know what to expect. I would say the whole story is comparable to a movie like ""The Great Gatsby"" a pointless body of motion picture trying to lure audience with scenes of ultra rich extravaganza! Movie is mostly talking heads with limited action, 75%+ of the movie is plain exposition, explaining everything but something relevant to the movie, absolutely nothing to root for. OK, it is a motion picture about the daily life of a rich psycho who kills people... so what? What is the message? What is the resolve? Where is the structure? Screenplay never followed the approved Hollywood guidelines, one simple flat line from start to finish so I wonder how did it pass the studio executives into production. The exposition was so weak that the audience may not realize that the movie occurs in late 80s not early 2000s, apparently the director assumed that everybody read the book and now wishes to see it on big screen.

I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.

Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction.

Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.",2001

However, coming out of the movie, we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.",2000
10,"This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.",2001
8,"I respect and admire this movie, even though (and perhaps because) it is complex, occasionally irritating and often very hard to take.  Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.",2002
10,"Oh my, where shall I begin? Experimental film making bursts into mainstream in this dramatic tail of 4 people who find themselves spiraling down the abyss, after experiencing a rendez-vous with the inevitable consequences attributed to drug use and the ill effect it has on its addicts. This one has no happy ending. There's no sugar coating here. Albeit this film packs a harsh, blunt, and sometimes overwhelmingly genuine depiction of the havoc drug addiction can reap on its victims. Despite the disturbing message of the film, I never the less couldn't help but remain fascinated with it's experimental/avant-guard visual style: A smooth, elaborate and languid progression of cinematic eye candy orchestrated to almost resemble a shockumentary, complemented by an impressive and well composed soundtrack. Some of the visual techniques were similar to the ones Aronofsky used in his directorial debut ""Pi"", such as split-screen shots and the use of body cameras filmed at varying speeds. At times, the film seemed more like an acid trip than a feature film. A cry for help is clearly felt throughout the film, from its innocent and promising start, to its hauntingly chilling conclusion. The one scene that really blew me away was the scene where Marion (played by Jennifer Connelley) had just sold her body off for a bag of heroin...As she walks out the door of the apartment, along the corridor, into the elevator, down to the street: one can't help but feel the characters disgust with herself, filthy to the core, what it must feel like at...""ZERO"". The acting performances, especially by both Ellyn Burstyn and Marlon Wayans are simply breakthrough performances that earned critical acclaim across the board. Enough said. If this review alone does not compel you to experience the Film, I will just have to spell it out: PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS FILM - it may cause an uneasy stomach, but is well worth it - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! 11 out of 10.",2001
9,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",2001
7,"This will likely be the most modest review you'll read of this film in the first few pages of a sea of 10s. I nonetheless, am convinced a 7 is the highest the film deserves. Aronofsky creates a unique film about the horrors of four characters spiraling into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction. However, his reliance on creating an extreme, hyperbolic film undermines the movie's appeal. The film seems to be an example of pushing the boundaries simply for the sake of pushing boundaries, as no real message. It would be similar to calling a horror movie a 'classic' because the director showed a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a 'classic' because it has 1/2 hour of real sex. Nonsense. The best films are the ones that leave the gory or gruesome details to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message. I really got no message from the film which is heavily focused on torturing four miserable characters again and again....and again and again. What's the point? The four main actors in the film are phenomenal. Marlon Wayans surprisingly gives a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture comedies. He may have given the best or second best performance of the four. Jennifer Connelly gives a credible performance as a desperate and loyal girlfriend forced to do unthinkable sex acts.

1,"I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying ""hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too."" Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch ""panic in needle park"" or the german movie ""christiane f"" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this.",2002
1,It baffles me how Aronofsky has managed to fool audiences and critics to rave about not one but two nonsensical stories in the last few years. If you manage to keep your cool under the barrage of imagery thrown at you from frame one you should be able to spot plot holes in this film so large that they'll make Pi's nonsensical ending look like plausible narrative.,2002
10,I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind ,2009
5,It seems that most people either hate or love this movie. I do both.,2011
1,"This movie struck me as utterly phony, which was surprising as Aronfsky's prior film, ""Pi,"" was amazing. Never once, from the very beginning, did I believe I was watching anything but specific actors play-acting. Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York ""Jewish"" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous! I mean, are we going back to ""The Goldbergs"" and 1950?",2001
1,"Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap ""Pi"", Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to ""A Clockwork Orange"" are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.",2001
10,"One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was ""Just say no,"" and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their ""dreams"" ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.",2005
10,"There are few men working on television today that rival the wit, the insight, or the genius of Larry David. To compare ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" to ""Seinfeld"" is preposterous. With ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", Larry David has created one of the greatest comedic series one have ever seen on American television. Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.",2005
9,"Honestly, Why this has not been picked up by a mainstream network in the UK I don't know. OK the content to put it mildly is risqué and the profanity is a little excessive. But I thought a late slot on BBC2 would be ideal (I think it may be on one of the channel 4 cable channels).",2006
10,"This hilarious show is created and written by comedic genius Larry David (co creator of Seinfeld)who stars as a fictionalized version of himself and follows the daily life of the wealthy millionaire. The story often revolves around the socially awkward positions Larry gets himself into due to his problems, expectations and annoyances of other people and his difficulty letting these slide unexpressed.",2013
10,"Larry David features as himself in this curious, vicious and truly excellent comedy from The States.",2009
5,"This show has a seinfeldian feel to it, you can tell Larry David strongly influenced the George character in Seinfeld (it was based on him). This show is sort of like what Seinfeld would be, if you took out Jerry Seinfeld and made George a successful guy living in LA. Its funny but you need the straight guy like Jerry, the one who remains the neutral spectator that the audience can identify with.",2008
10,"Normally, I don't go for the type of sitcom made in the United States. As I'm English, the usual classics like ""Friends"" and ""Seinfield"" don't tend to match out against things like ""The Office"" and ""Peep Show"". Now, it's probably because I'm British that I've developed these comedy tastes, but I am in no way against the sort of stuff the USA turn out. ""Scrubs"", ""Home Improvement"" and ""South Park"" are some of my favourite shows of all time, all funny in their own ways. Recently I invested in series one of a very different show, something that I thought I'd buy after seeing a few clips on a TV special. ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is the king of sitcoms - and here's why.",2006
10,"Although I haven't had the opportunity to watch this series in its entirety I would like to comment on the quality of this man's comedic writing style (yes I read the script!). He is one of the best comedic writers of my lifetime that I have become familiar with. No need for me to kiss up anymore than that. I'm sure your fans are as vast as the sand particles on your private beach and you've earned em. I have to write Ten lines or it Won't accept My review. Umm.. Ya... About the Episode with the doll... I'm surprised how long it took me to read the Script. I'm 87% sure it had nothing to do with me... But on the crazy Outside 13% chance it may have... I've never felt more honored and Humbled at the same time. And if there is any truth to that rumor, I'm rightfully ashamed it took me so long to acknowledge it and respond.",2013
1,"Watching this, you can just tell that Larry David thinks he's the funniest person ever. He thinks he's so funny that every episode can be like a slow-paced version of Whose Line Is It Anyway, starring only himself. His performance is so fake and full of self-admiration that you can almost see him grinning proudly at the camera whenever he hears the sound of his own voice. But it's just not interesting to hear him go on and on in a stereotypical, slow and uninspired version of neurotic-Jewish-comedian style. It's especially annoying when he repeats the same thing over and over in an obvious attempt to appear humorously neurotic that quickly becomes boring (eg ""a guy in a suit stealing my newspaper? A GUY IN A SUIT STEALING MY NEWSPAPER? A guy in a suit... stealing my newspaper!?"" ... repeating a joke that's already obvious does not make it better).",2009
1,"This show contains all of the annoying traits of ""Seinfeld"" and none of the humour. I watched the pilot and most of the first episode. What I saw was people misinterpreting situations (example - the tenting of the pants), people over-reacting to situations (example - the Hitler comment), and people being rude to other people (example, Jeff's making a big fuss over having HBO pay for Larry's porn video in the hotel). This isn't comedy. This is just irritating. This is just grown people acting like children. This is the same reason that I could never understand why ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" was such a big hit. The only redeeming feature of the show is the complete lack of snotty kids who treat their parents with complete disrespect and contempt.",2009
10,"Larry David co-created one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, Seinfeld, with fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Following the end of Seinfeld, David was inactive for a brief period of time. That is until 2000, when Larry was back with his new show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which stars Larry as himself. Something about this show just works, their isn't a definite script of dialog, it is an outline with a lot of improvising. This show is honestly one of those shows that you have to catch on a weekly basis. For some reason the Larry David character has become just one of those characters that you have to tune in for each week to see what trouble he is getting himself into.",2009
10,"CYE is definitely not for everyone, you either get it or you don't. I personally think it is true comedic genius, just terrific writing and delivery. I have never laughed so hard at a small screen comedy as I have with this, even if it's just because HBO allows LD a wider latitude than broadcast networks could, or would. While CYE can be bizarre and ironic, you still feel like it could all really happen just the way it's written. I give it a 9 only because I can't give it a 9.9 (nothing is perfect so 10 is out). If you haven't seen it, you should, and I hope you laugh out loud as much as I do while watching it. If not, then just don't bother watching it anymore because you'll never like it more than you do with the first one you see. If you like it, then you're in for a treat, because there are no ""bad"" episodes; in a comforting way, they are all the same but still very different and hilarious.",2007
1,"I get the feeling that a lot of the people who have positive comments about ""Curb your Enthusiasm,"" heard good things about it and just went along with the crowd in thinking it was good. Folks, this is the worst show I have watched recently. Larry David is no actor and it seems like the scenes were all done with only one take. Some people like the improvised style but I have seen many directors do improv much better.",2006
9,HAHAHAH. CYE is one of the few American comedies i can bring myself to watch. It reminds me a fair bit or Seinfeld in the way it observes life's quirks and unwritten rules. Larry David uses awkward and realistic situations that puts human nature in the spotlight.,2006
10,"You know how you still quote and remember episodes of Seinfeld ten years later? This is that kind of show - I can think of so many hilarious episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm that I can't help sitting here smiling to myself. The one where Larry accidentally gets Jeff's 7 year old daughter drunk on wine, the episode where Larry won't take off his shoes at the porn party, or when he accidentally gets an erotic massage. This is one of the very few non-animated shows that makes me laugh out loud. Larry David is so neurotic but normal at the same time and Jeff's wife is such a funny secondary character. If you haven't watched this show, you're missing one of the few smart comedies on TV - get it on DVD and watch it from the beginning like a marathon.",2006
10,"Bring It On (2000) is a underrated teen cheerleading movie with Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an inner-city school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films, like were Major League (1989) and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true, the best, cheerleading comedy in the film series. ",2015
8,"This movie was extremely enjoyable and I recommend it. The characters are not annoying for the most part, and I especially enjoyed seeing new faces Elisa Dushku (Missy) and Jesse Bradford (Cliff).  They have screen presence and should be in front of the camera for many years to come, especially Elisa, who is really very beautiful.  When you look at her, there's so much there, unlike most actresses whose faces do not say anything.  You can tell there is alot going on in her mind just by her face. ",2000
8,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Bring It On"". The film's brisk pacing was  perfectly suited to its theme, thanks to director Peyton Reed, the writing smart, sharp, and consistently and authentically funny,(as well as, at times, genuinely thought-provoking)thanks to writer Jessica Bendinger, and the acting solid all around. I also liked ""Bring It On"" for what it didn't have-alot of tired, cliched boy-girl relationship stuff, and/or gratuitous sex/nudity. The opening dream/cheer sequence was a moment of sheer, brilliant comic/satiric movie magic, and later, when the professional choreographer shows up to help the Toros out, he almost steals the show. But what impressed me, perhaps, most of all about ""Bring It On"" was the wonderful chemistry between the two beautiful-and talented-young female leads, Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku.",2000
5,"This is a movie where more talent than necessary has been invested in a film basically aimed at entertainment-seeking adolescents, people interested in dance routines, and a few older men who enjoy watching young girls jump about. It follows the fortunes of an award-winning cheerleader team and the hapless football team they support.",2000
7,"Interestingly enough, one of the most tired and boring cliches in both film and high school has been the subject of two genuinely enjoyable, if fluffy, movies in less than a year. I speak of course, about cheerleaders and both 'Bring It On' and 'Sugar and Spice'. But while 'Sugar and Spice' was campy and surreal, 'Bring It On' is a self-consciously serious movie advancing the idea of the cheerleader as athlete. While this idea is an honest and accurate one, it's one that audiences will only take so far. Cheerleaders may indeed be finer athletes than those on the sports teams they cheer for- I'd believe it, although I've never been a cheerleader and only rarely watch them on ESPN. I do know, though, that 'sissy, girly' activities are very frequently more difficult than 'tough, manly' activities, but try telling the boys that- or a movie audience. No matter how many big-budget and/or 'true story' movies are made wherein football is a metaphor for life or boxing is an affirmation of the greatness of the human spirit, even the most fascinating stories about sports like gymnastics or figure skating are strictly television movie-of-the-week fodder. In this atmosphere, you cannot make a cheerleading movie serious. You have to make it a joke. The smart folks behind Bring It On, though, realized that if they could strike a certain balance they could fulfill expectations but also get their point across. So they filled their flick with cute, peppy girls like Kirsten Dunst- always a delight, and well-cast here as a golden girl with a conscience- and snappy, irreverent jokes. They have a PG-13 locker room scene and a bikini carwash. They also have broken bones and high stress- very real factors in the lives of competitive cheerleaders. The squad is co-ed, and we get to know two of these curious, maligned creatures commonly known as male cheerleaders. One of them *is* gay- and an extremely well-adjusted, likable and ""non-faggy"" one, at that. The other is straight, and as horny as any frat boy in Animal House. We also have a tough girl named Missy transferring from L.A., along with her cute brother Cliff and the news that the Toro squad's cheers are not ""100% original"", as they had believed. Unfortunately for Kirsten's character Torrance and her Rancho Carne Toros, their ex-captain stole all their prize-winning routines from an East Compton squad (which are perhaps overly rude, even given the circumstances), that will be going to Nationals for the first time. So what's a cheerleading squad to do, except experience various pratfalls on the way to coming up with their own routine and competing and learning something about valuing your own strengths? It's better than it sounds, surprisingly- and refreshingly- enough. As for macho posturing at sports movies, the fact that this was a sueprise hit and 'Sugar and Spice' was not might just be a sign that there are audiences too smart to believe that any movie about female athletes must automatically be completely silly. What a surprising- and refreshing- change.",2001
10,"This film does not aspire to be more than it is.  Accepted for what it is, BRING IT ON is a perfect 10.",2003
6,"This delightful comedy uses its ostensible theme of cheerleading rivalry to comment on its own genre, the teen movie.  Given a genuinely exciting reinvention by 'Clueless', and reaching a peak with the likes of 'American Pie' and '10 Things I hate about you', the genre is in danger, as all successful genres are, of exchanging its wit, visual exuberance, engaging playing and agreeable sentiment for cash-hungry formulae and all-round laziness.  ",2001
10,"I am not going to make any excuses. This was an excellent film for all ages. So many of the positive reviews I have seen prior to this one have had to make disclaimers (e.g. yes, it was childish...) but I will not do so. I am going to be confident in the intelligence of anyone reading this to understand that the quality of a film always has to be taken in the context it was meant to be viewed in. Bring It On is an excellent farce making fun of The Stereotypical Cheerleader. At the same time, the characters were very real, well played, and easy to empathize with. The movement (dance?) was lots of fun to watch. I also felt that the characters were much more realistic than many teenage characters are usually portrayed in film - more sarcastic and intelligently witty and sexual than usual. I think this is good, because many films give the impression that all teenagers are naive and childish, when in fact this is not necessarily the case. I must admit though that I couldn't help thinking that certain things had to happen the way they did for the sake of Political Correctness, and that is disappointing, but from the filmmakers perspective understandable. It was good to see a little bit of gay-friendliness in the film, which is rare to find in any films.",2000
6,"Torrance Shipman(Kirsten Dunst)becomes the new captain of the high school cheer leading team that takes pride in winning competition championships year after year. She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named Missy(Eliza Dushku)to convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders. This is an interesting eyeful, but actually just another vehicle for the enticing Miss Dunst.",2001

10,"This is an excellent movie with excellent, acting, costumes, directing, production, script storyline, music and lessons. The biggest lesson of all that it teaches is that winning is not whats important it's trying your best that is. The other biggest lesson of all that it teaches is that you should give everyone and anyone a chance no matter what.",2005
7,"I actually only went to see it since it appeared at the time it would be the number one movie in the country. But much to my surprise it wasn't all that bad. Cheesy? Yes. Bad dialogue? Absolutely. Fun? I thought it was. It didn't take itself so seriously that it was horrible, and it took itself seriously enough that it was fun watching these kids cheerlead their little hearts out.",2001
10,"Bring It On was not that big at first, but it became very popular very quickly. Starring Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku, I thought it was fantastic. It had funny dialogue and great cheers that made you want to get up and learn them. The romance between Torrance Shipman and Cliff Pantone was adorable. And the friendship between Missy Pantone and Torrance Shipman looked as though it could last forever. Even a small movie like this one can be deserving of a 10 from me. The plot basically consisted of: Torrance Shipman becomes captain of the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading squad. A new girl on the team, Missy Pantone becomes her best friend and shows her that all of their routines were stolen from the East Compten Clovers. They work to come up with a new routine for nationals and at the same time, Torrance has the hotts for Missy's brother, Cliff Pantone. At nationals, the Toros come in second with their new and original routine and the East Compten Clovers win first, and finally there is peace between the squads, and it ends with a kiss between Torrance Shipman and Cliff Pantone. This is just the summary, but I suggest that everyone go and watch it!",2006
7,"Torrance is the newly appointed captain of cheerleader champions the Toros. After one of the team suffers an accident, the Toros recruit gymnastics star Missy Pantone, but upon witnessing the Toros first routine Missy is disgusted and points out that it has been stolen from another team called The East Compton Clovers. This opens up a whole can of worms that not only brings the Toros into conflict with the Clovers, but also means that they must come up with an original routine if they are to win the American championship honestly.",2008
10,"This has to be one of the greatest films ever made. Really I am serious. I saw it when it first came out in 2000. I really like cheer leading but I myself am not a cheerleader. i am more of a punk/skater chick. But I love it. It has great energy and I liked how they portrayed cheerleaders, it was very realistic. Some of my friends are cheerleaders and I know what they are like. Just like they say in this film, cheerleaders are athletes. Not air heads. I hate how in all these shows and movies they show cheerleaders as the following; dumb, mean, rude, popular, idiotic, totally ditz. That's not what this is. I liked Missy. She was more of a motorcycle chick/tomboy before she was convinced by Torrance to join the Toros. I like that she became more confident and more feminine after wards but still kept her sassy attitude. I also liked Torrance. Instead of her being a mean captain, she was sweet and nice to everyone. I really liked Isis and Jenelope too. Isis had a great attitude and was a strong leader. Jenelope was just really funny. Great attitude. This movie didn't use corny humor. This movie was realistically funny and well acted. The cheer routines were also very good. The music, the gymnastics, the dance, etc. They weren't those silly routines you see in movies. They were athletic and really cool! I would say my favorite routine was the Clover's routine at both regionals and at the finals. They were really interesting routines. But the Toros rocked too. The great actresses made the movie. Kirsten was sweet, Eliza showed a lot of emotion, and Gabriella is just the perfect part for Isis; pretty, athletic, great actress, perfect! This movie had a great script and great cheer leading. Watch it! Boys like it too. My friend, Tim thinks this movie is hilarious! Watch it, all genders. Really realistic film.",2006
7,"This movie is cheesy, preppy, dumb, simple and BRILLIANT! Granted I saw this when I was 14, I thought this movie was fantastic. I think the main audience for this movie is girls aged 11 - 17(ish), but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's your typical teen movie/chick flick.",2006
10,There is hardly any other movie with such an opening scene like that what this baby has. Perhaps it would have been appropriate if the people who produced this had given a warning beforehand that there has never been anywhere such a start off like that. If people survive the opening without shocking too much from an outburst of that amount of energy they probably watch the film too.,2006
10,"I tend to eschew frivolous films, and because of this I have had to defend my appreciation of this movie. ",2006
10,"Another user who commented on this movie compared it to such teen movies as Dick, Rushmore, 10 Things I Hate About You and Election. That was their first problem. Bring It On is not, nor was it intended to be, in the same category as these movies. All of these movies are great in their own right, but in my opinion comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges. Granted, you don't necessarily have to put on your thinking cap when watching Bring It On, but that's part of the beauty of the movie. It gets it's point across without beating it into your head. Maybe cheerleading isn't as easy as it looks. Maybe cheerleaders aren't as dumb as they look. Maybe if you get past your initial opinion of someone, you'll find that you have more in common than you expected. The bottom line is that some days, after a long day at work, I just want to put a movie in and be highly entertained for a few hours, and Bring It On is the perfect movie for that.",2003

Please god, save your brains!",2000
7,"While Bring it On is not a masterpiece in any shape or form, I have to admit I really enjoyed it. Sure it is fluffy and predictable, with clichéd characters and scenarios, but when you look past the flaws you have a bright and energetic film with a fair amount to redeem it. For instance, it is beautifully filmed, and also has an agreeable soundtrack and sprightly cheer-leading choreography. The dialogue is smart and doesn't feel cringe-worthy or inane, the pacing is snappy and direction is decent. The performances from the cast are very spirited, especially from Kirsten Dunst who is appealing in the lead. In conclusion, not brilliant but energetic and dare I say fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",2010
1,"Seeing ""Bring It On"" was more painful than having my wisdom teeth removed!! How this film made 17 million dollars in one weekend is even more beguiling. Is this what teenagers today relate to or were there just a lot of dirty old men who wanted to be teased by scantily clad adolescents? This film wants to be R rated but stay safely in the PG-13 zone, so what we get are ugly camera shots that are positioned just above the frontal nudity format.",2000
10,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

10,"If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.",2005
7,"There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.",2006

10,"There's all you might imagine, a real life situation for an epic. Remember that such battles where very common, not to mention the thousands of lives lost.

6,"Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.",2008
1,"This movie is the very epitome of what I hate about movies.  The Hollywood-ization/bastardization of what could have been a great movie. The FX and action were great, the characterization was adequate, the plot was dumb, and the ending was abysmal.  Why doesn't anyone in Hollywood have the courage to take a movie where it ought to go instead of where the test audiences say it should go?",2004
9,"Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.",2005
10,"If their is ever a film to watch to get motivated, it's this. You don't have to be an American football lover, just any sport, or activity. The passion displayed on the screen could get Sven Goran Eriksson in the mood. Their are particular inaccuracies in order to make this into more of a film, but I wouldn't call it predictable. This is based on a true story, and the 13 and 0 record really happened, so this true story was what created the predictable film stereotype. I love the choice of actors in the film. Each person seems to be able to tap in to the feelings of their character, which creates a much more realistic film. It depicts the nature of racism within peoples lives very well and shows how common loves for different things can pull people together so that simple and wrong beliefs are forgotten. Needless to say this film makes me feel better about the world, while making me want to be a winner as well.",2006
10,"Remember the Titans is much more than a story about a high school football team. It is a true story about two men who overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration, anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the high schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to assistant coach.",2005
10,"Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like ""Hoosiers"" this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.",2006
10,"This movie received a lot of criticism for being a little too ""light"" in it's depiction of racism in that time period. However, the fact that Disney decided to take on the topic at all astounds me. I think that this movie is incredibly effective and an excellent football movie. It really sucks you into these characters and make you feel for them. I am emotionally affected by this film no matter how many times I've seen it, and I think that this movie will stand up over time as one of the most endearing sports classics of all time.",2005

9,"""Remember the Titans"" is a movie that by the end of seeing it makes you feel good. And why shouldn't it? You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company, and I think it's perfect for the whole family. ""Remember the Titans"" is a comedy-drama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students, white and black teachers, and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton, there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps ""Remember the Titans"" from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with ""the big game"". Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in ""Remember the Titans"", but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win, win, win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line: ""Remember the Titans"" is an excellent film, very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.",2000
10,"Other reviewers here have covered the backstory, the direction, the production, and just about everything there is to cover for this excellent and unforgettable film. Except for one thing. It is a peculiarity of the film business that some actors peak early, for no obvious reason, and others just keep on going, like the Energizer rabbit. Michael Caine -- excuse me SIR Caine -- has been making movies for decades. Sometimes he is brilliant and sometimes he is not. Samuel L. Jackson has been in so many movies that (to this reviewer) it seems like the writers have reached the point where they no longer bother naming a character, they just pencil in the margins that they have written a part for Jackson. Denzel, who was beyond brilliant here, it is so hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the conviction and the diction that is his trademark, seems to have stopped doing these sorts of parts (written in 2013) and frankly, more's the pity. Hollywood is like that. So on top of all the other excellent reasons to see and enjoy this film, here is one more. Denzel at his peak. What more can I say?",2013
2,"In the last decade, I've realized that perhaps the most difficult ""genre"" of movie to make work is the SPORTS movie! Not only are there only probably a handful of 'great' sports films in the history of cinema, there are really very few 'good' sports movies (relative to how many sports films that have been made). Really, the 1980s is the end of the era of even good sports movies (and most of them about baseball!). It was officially over and done with then.",2011

1,"This film is one terrible lie. As with a handful of other reviewers here, I was also a victim of the TC juggernaut, having attended Groveton High School during that period. It was a joke to play TC in any varsity team sport: football, basketball, soccer... it didn't matter. Everyone knew that a school three times their size was going to destroy us -- the only question was how badly. They were never, ever, an underdog in any sport — to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.",2015
1,"This movie is more extremely annoying. In 1971, I was in 10th grade at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington County, Virginia. We were about 5 miles from T. C. Williams (Titans) and we played them regularly in every sport (including track, which was my sport). I have personal knowledge of the events in that film. First of all, the idea that T. C. Williams had just been integrated is incorrect. Schools in the area had been integrated for 15 years. By 1971, it was routine to have blacks and whites in the same school. Come look at my yearbooks and I'll show you. What happened at T. C. Williams was this: the Alexandria school system decided to change the status of three schools..........Hammond HS, George Washington HS, and T. C. Williams HS. Hammond was reduced to a junior high, and its students were sent to Williams. GW was closed and its students were sent to Williams. Everyone in the ENTIRE AREA knew that Alexandria had just created a super sports school and it was true. With the best athletes from three schools combined into one, there was no beating T. C. Williams. We played them in football that year and they beat us about 49-0, but it sure as hell had nothing to do with integrating a school and everything about creating a super school. Next, the idea that Alexandria was a small, backward town with rampant racial prejudice is laughable. Alexandria is a MAJOR suburb of Washington, DC. You can stand in Alexandria, look across the Potomac River, and see the Washington Monument, Capitol Hill, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, etc. It was and is a rich suburb of DC, and racial prejudice was about as far from being mainstream as I am from marrying Miss America. In my school, the white kids were afraid of the black kids. We didn't initiate fights, we tried hard to avoid them, but sometimes they were forced upon us by angry groups of students who roamed the halls and you sure as hell better look out if you didn't cringe to the side and let them pass. There is one scene in the movie where a white football coach calls the T. C. Williams coach a ""monkey"" on local TV. Good Lord.........that sort of thing would NEVER have been put on a Washington, DC sports channel and that is where ALL the channels received in northern Virginia originated (with the exception of channel 20 which had no news at that time). The people who made this movie had an agenda. I know the facts. I was there. I ran track in that T. C. Williams stadium and they beat the hell out of us because they were a super school. It is both sad and annoying that people will watch this movie and believe that how things are portrayed is actually how they were. They absolutely were not!",2008
7,"Tossing it out there like a football, this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football, but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye"" Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans.",2013

9,"Rememmber the Titans is a wonderful film, compelling, compassionate, funny and often moving. It tells the story of a dedicated coach seen tackling the explosive combination of football and racial desegregation in 1970s America. The film is quite ambitious, but it not only really does pack an emotional punch but it does linger long into the memory and is several notches above sports movies I have seen. For one thing, it is slickly directed by Boaz Yakin, and benefits also from wonderful cinematography and a music score of sweeping grandeur, almost epic. Even better than any of these put together, is the marvellous lead performance of Denzel Washington that was worth an Oscar, it seems as though in every film I've seen of his he manages to give a compelling performance and this includes the underrated Cry Freedom. Will Patton matches him perfectly in a smooth, quiet and perhaps low key performance as his counterpart that isn't at all clichéd. Hayden Pannetiere also gives a fine performance, even though I didn't see how her character would ever overcome her differences with her sister. The script is extremely sharp and decisive, the editing is crisp and fast and the football parts are enough to pump up your adrenaline. The epilogue could bring tears to your eyes, as it is so beautifully put. All in all, wonderful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",2010
7,"""Remember the Titans"" tells about a black football coach (Washington) who transfers to an integrated high school where he's faced with turning black and white prejudices into teamwork and winning the state championship with a racially mixed team in a racially divided society. On the downside, ""Titans"" shows us nothing new, runs too long, gets too busy and is a journeyman production at best. On the upside, the film turns black and white issues into appropriate shades of gray, delivers lots of grid iron action, and waxes to a Rockyesque ""feel good"" conclusion. The fact that females scored this football flick higher (on IMDB.com) than males is telling.",2001
8,"Racial prejudice is the pariah of our society. It permeates every avenue to making the world a fair place to live. It's not just American society either. It's in the North, the South, and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film, the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted, it's just a movie, but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said, I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable (although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wall--this is happening in most football movies). The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practice--Sunshine and Louis--who just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive, but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. ",2006
8,"The hugely popular ""CSI"" is no less than a contemporary entertainment marvel. Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, ""CSI"" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the ""truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction"" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, ""CSI"" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines? CSI1:""There's a sucker born every minute.""  CSI2: ""Yeah. And they all come to Vegas.""  Truer words....",2004

8,"I love these kinds of shows, so I came across CSI:Crime Scene Inestigation by accident while flicking through channels, and since that moment I have been hooked. I like how each crime is looked at from a different perspective, it offers a whole new slant on things, although some of the more disturbing/graphic images may turn your stomach a little. Also, I love the colours the series is shot in, reds, blues, greens and yellow, really a treat to the eye, and the photography is very impressive. And the music is funky and cool, well the theme song is from The Who, they ooze with coolness. I like the writing, Grissom's dialogue and asides are a joy to behold especially, and the methodical but well structured story lines. The season finales nearly always manage to be gripping and compelling. And the acting is great, William Peterson was wonderful as Grissom, and although I was sad to see him go, the character's departure was handled very well so I was glad of that. The reason why it isn't quite as good as it could have been is because somehow I don't find it as well thought out as the earlier seasons. And while Laurence Fishburne is a great actor and does a good job, I kind of miss Grissom if you get the jist. That said though, this is a great show. 8/10 Bethany Cox",2010

7,"After initially being introduced to this series, I instantly fell in love with the show. I feel that the writing is very inventive and even when the show is based off of something from the news, the writers do an excellent job of putting a unique spin on it to fit the fluidness of the shows style. But what I think makes this show so successful is the characters and the way each of the cast members pull off their character to bring a unique blend of personalities that work perfectly off of each other. The characters of Grissom and Willows, played by William Peterson and Marg Helgenberger, give the show its balance. Then you have characters like Nick Stokes (played by George Eads) who is your typical guy's guy and Warrick Brown (played by Gary Dourdan) who is more level but the two play off of each other very well, as you tend to see them in competition with each other. The writers have also written in a great character named Sara Sidle (played by Jorja Fox) who is portrayed as a confident woman in a manly male dominated cast. Sidle is able to stand her ground and even at times run circles around Stokes and Brown, yet she still has the uncertainties and emotions of a woman, but it is played with an certain grace that makes the audience feel confident in her character. The writers have taken great lengths to make sure that the science, which is also a character in this show, is very accurate, yet easy enough for the audience to understand. It is very easy to see why this show has become such a hit, and its spin off shows (Miami and NY) are becoming just as popular.",2006

Back in 2001. when I saw the first episodes, it was a refreshing TV substance, beside the fact it was based on crime and murder, which I am not a great fan of. Unlike the classic detective series which by the late 90s have become boring as hell with all too predictable plots, CSI brought a fresh insight and opened a new window into TV crime. Although it was only slightly based on science and criminal forensics, CSI was a fun thing to watch... it was indeed.",2010

So nice, so easy, so sci-fi at moments, with everybody doing their job brilliantly, with the help of their uber cool technical equipment; almost iritant. It is somewhat enjoyable, i suppose because of the use of excellent cinematic techniques, but i can never get excited watching it. I can't get in touch with the victim, i can't feel what the killer felt, i can't get upset when some supposedly important twist happens. I'm never surprised. Alright, i know i'm asking for too much out of an hour long episode, but even in such case, i don't think it's impossible do make that level of quality investigation drama happen.
