2,Sry for my English - i am from Germany!,2016
6,"I wanted to like this show, I really did. But when the writers consistently try to treat me like I'm a nine-year-old with ADHD, it gets old. Plot holes in this series are ENORMOUS.",2016
2,"I'm not sure exactly who this movie was made for, I mean if it were made exclusively for 13 year old children, then I might be very understanding as to why it feels really weird to watch, I literally can't stand this movie, Please who wrote the scripts? No imagination! at first I thought it must be one of those indoor nerds who wrote the entire thing but then, there was that episode where apparently Cisco had to hack the city's network and they weren't being explicit as to what ""network"" they wanted to hack, then apparently the network was hacked in 4 seconds, like I could see the laptop the apparent hacker used showing graphic images of 3D models, that was when I knew it wasn't even a geek who wrote the Script. The languages are too cliché and I had to ask for help to un-see this thing. don't even get me started with the Intro speech. But then again, perhaps they wanted just an audience of 13 year olds.",2017
1,"""My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive"" - But every other speedster on the show is 100000000 times faster than this piece of poorly written and played character(even the new speedsters who just got their speed). ""I hunted down the man who killed my mother"" - No duh you did. He didn't even remotely hunt him down, it's actually the opposite way around and in the end it was not even him who defeated the reverse flash. It was because of eddie the reverse flash was defeated. And Gaaaawwwddddd !! The actor is terrible.He always talks as if he's got a tampon size ice cube up his arse. Not to mention the writing of the show is so cringeworthy, the flash heavily depends on other character's advice to use his powers. The flash himself is an intelligent personality who can figure counter measures on his own. Remember with his ability to run faster came the ability to think faster and better.",2016
2,Might contain spoilers yet it is hard to spoil the show that spoiled.,2017
2,"This show really makes you wish to be able to go back into the mind of a little child. Unfortunately, if you have an IQ higher than that of a 6 year old or are not a complete idiot, you will witness the absolute murderfest of a character you may have held dear and loved all your life. ",2016
1,"In my opinion, this show started great with a surprising first season, but as the second season came along is like the show- runners and script writers ran out of ideas and started doing random stuff that made no sense whatsoever. The second season had way too many plot holes and continuity errors. Too many things made no sense whatsoever and many other things were left completely unexplained. It was almost as if the both the show- runners and the script writers were changed halfway through the season and they had no idea what was going on with the show. I won't get too much into detail but an example of this was the Zoom almost killing ""Jay Garrick"" flashback at the beginning of the season. Technically, with what happened later on the show, that NEVER happened since it was all made up by zoom, so why show a flashback to an event that never happened?! A second example was when Zoom killed his Jay Garrick self in front of the team. He arrived with the body at his lair and said ""Well, this is a complication"" but then like 3 episodes later supposedly it was all part of his plan all along and his Jay Garrick self agreed to being killed. So why, if it was all part of his plan all along and his other self agreed to being killed, why was it a complication? The season already ended and this was never explained. These two things I just mentioned were left completely unexplained and it caused continuity errors with things that happened later that SAME season. They create quite the plot holes as well. But these are just two of perhaps the 10 to 15 things that were left completely unexplained by that season. It is almost as if they just rushed through the script writing without revising it after they were done. They really didn't think things through with this season. Maybe the success of the first season got in their heads and they thought they could just make a bunch of random illogical stuff and people would like it.",2016
1,I have been quite happy with the Flash until I saw season 2 Episode 18. The writing in that episode is beyond stupidity. Why?,2016
5,"This is my first time writing a review, but that's just how irritating this show was for me, one word to describe this show is cliché. First of all the show is so repetitive, the villain makes a first appearance and the flash with all his speed and abilities has to lose to the villain at first and then go prepare himself in star labs then he beats the villain in a rather disappointing showdown, excuse me but İ find it illogical that the flash would stop right before catching a shapeshifter just to tell him ""You cant outrun me"" resulting in his escape, really ? what a cliché. And yes the inconsistency of the flash's powers why isn't he able to avoid getting punched ? or speed his way out of a group of bees ? or avoid getting hit by a freezing/fire throwing gun ? it's just lazy on the writers' side to not try and find real challenges to his abilities instead of just contradicting the powers he shows in other unnecessary aspects of his life. Show is also full of plot holes, star labs is the place where everything about barry's identity is kept secret yet people just keep barging in on them like iris confirming the flash's identity, also how eddie keeping barry's identity a secret is affecting his relationship with iris is beyond me it's like they're begging for something to fill the episodes with, not to mention the corny dialogue. Also if cisco put his mind to it he can cure cancer.",2015
10,"I have been a huge fan of this series and really loved it for first two seasons.But now they are losing there track and I don't know why they are so much focused on Joe's family.He found his wife, got his son, he is dating Cecile and now is going have a baby.Sometimes it feels like the Joe is the main character and all story revolves around him.",2017
7,"If you had asked me a couple of years ago what the best super hero TV show at the time was, I would have said The Flash.",2017
3,When I was a lad back in the 60s my favourite super heroes were The Flash and Green Lantern. I'll discuss the horror that was the recent Green Lantern movie in that thread.,2015
5,"Every episode Iris West goes on and on about how ""Barry lied to me,"" ""My father lied to me,"" ""my boyfriend lied to me."" Talk about a broken record. First she goes from being a waitress to magically getting a job as a top reporter. Then she spends the rest of her screen time accusing people of lying to her, then acting like a 10 year old by giving everyone the silent treatment. Her rants are always about, ""I thought you loved me,"" ""I thought you were my best friend."" Unfortunately I know I am not the only person who just wants someone to put a bullet in her head and get that annoying character off the show. And why on earth would anyone want to date or live with that shrew? Her character adds nothing to any storyline. Get rid of her. It is otherwise a pretty good, albeit, a kind of childish show.",2015
2,"The spoilers here are very minor and will not affect your experience if  you're the average person. Still, better safe than sorry.  WRITING (Conflicts, character actions, and dialogue)  The writing in this show is less than impressive. There is no such  thing as subtlety and half the dialogue is them throwing in the word  ""fast"" for the hell of it. At one point, a character says to some  random thug ""Freeze! Now, get on the ground or do you wanna find out  the hard way that you're not faster than a bullet?"" I'm actually quite  certain that the line verbatim is worse than that.  A lot of plot points make no sense, and this is a huge problem with The  Flash in general. The Flash is so fast that few conflicts are actually  conflicts for The Flash, but rather than being creative and trying to  think up interesting conflicts, they make the characters mentally  incompetent to the point that The Flash, who can dodge a bullet, cannot  dodge a punch. This actually becomes the main plot point of an entire  episode. His inability to dodge attacks at normal speed makes no sense.  Also, he has a tendency to block bullets that he doesn't even know are  there. In one episode, he reaches behind him and pinches a random spot  behind his neck and there just happens to be a bullet there for him to  block! What an ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE COINCIDENCE! That is the laziest  writing ever. ""We need our character to get shot at without getting  shot. Let's just have him randomly reach back for some reason, I'm sure  we'll figure it out in post.""  There's an episode where he has to catch three motorcyclists. So, he  runs to each of them, takes them to a police station and handcuffs them  to a pole like he always does.  I'm just kidding, he creates roadblocks where he thinks they'll go so  that he can make all the motorcyclists go towards each other, and then  they won't know how to move past each other, so they'll stop and the  police can get them, at which point there will be an utterance of  ""Checkmate."" That last bit is also not a joke. That happened. This is  actually something that a producer and a team of writers looked over  and said ""Nothing wrong here. Onwards to production!""  Also, this is My Little Pony with adults watching (so, just My Little  Pony...with Rainbow Dash as the main character, I suppose). They like  to have Aesops to each episode, and they're very basic moral lessons,  or even broken ones, and then they'll do what's essentially a Dear  Celestia inner monologue at the end of each episode. ""Today, I  learned..."" Really? There's no subtlety in the character development at  all. At certain points, I swear the characters literally look at the  camera and go ""I've really changed today. I used to think A and now I  think B.""  Here's a bit of dialogue meant to be badass.  (Right before Barry's about to leave.) ""Barry."" (Barry stops to see why  his peer decided to stop him during this urgent mission.) ""Yes?"" ""Run.""  CONSISTENCY  There is no consistency with Barry's powers. The effects of running  really fast (friction, air compression, etc.) turn on and off randomly.  At one point, a woman's shirt burns off despite that making no sense  whatsoever, presumably because one of the writers thought that the  actress was hot and knew he had the power to get her to reveal a little  more.  As I mentioned before, he just decides not to dodge punches. Or grab  people's weapons to disarm them. He also runs slow enough for The Arrow  to see him and aim at him when he's fast enough to see bullets. Bullets  are so fast that 500 feet away, all you can do is blink before the  bullet reaches you. Otherwise, you're completely still. Everything  should be frozen for Barry, but he runs at the speed of a falcon from  time to time.  TECHNICALITIES  Bullets and guns. Don't expect them to make sense. Physics. Chemistry.  Science in general. Tensile strength being a huge factor when hitting  someone? Hearing a sonic boom from something that hasn't gotten to you  yet? A gun that creates the heat of the Big Bang? A needle the heat of  the Sun would kill everyone in at least a one thousand mile radius. A  warehouse the heat of all the energy in the universe (which, you might  notice, doesn't make sense) would evaporate all matter in the entire  solar system. But no worries here, just some second degree burns (these  were normal humans that got second degree burns, not The Flash, so no  superpowers to withstand the energy of the entire universe there). 500  proof alcohol? Iron oxide being uncommon?  Turn your brain off or get a hemorrhage. It's nice to see The Flash  moving about with live actors (though poor actors), but that's it.  That's the only pro. That's all this show gets.",2015
9,"I've only seen the first season so far so I'll comment on it. I'm a fanboy that loves superhero stuff. This series is everything I could want because it captures the spirit of heroism that's so important to any superhero endeavor. If anything Barry is a little too heroic, even apologizing for things that aren't his fault, but that's the kind of spirit the good guys should be about. Though I think he would have been a perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, I think Grant Gustin kills it as the Flash. He perfectly captures what it is to be a hero, selflessness (even when it's very painful), compassion and the willingness to risk his life to protect the innocent. That's what heroes are all about and something we've lost in an age where we choose to believe in nothing. Superheroes are all about Utopian ideals; what could we accomplish if we were truly good inside and were motivated by good intentions? We need heroes in our movies and TV and The Flash perfectly captures that. ",2017
1,"Firstly and most importantly this show is sooo bad because of the horrible acting , cliché dialogue and terrible writing . Why can't these superhero shows are given to writers and directors of shows like game of thrones , the wire , walking dead and shows like sopranos which has got such a bravo acting and story . I have seen that most of the Marvel's show are just crap only because of the terrible acting , dialogues and character . Now coming back to Flash , this show has one positive point and that is photography rest is just a garbage . And that character iris west , oh lord !!! can somebody just shut her up !! Even the lab geeks of STARS lab who has technology and help flash are soo terrible and the dialogues are so cliché and acting is just horrible and childish type , even the comedy punches are so horrible uughhhh..!!! This show is good for children in the age group 5-15 and for those who haven't seen any serial as mentioned above by me .There are so many logical errors in this show , i mean just take one for an example that the flash has got such a high speed and even though he just stand in front of a gun point and takes the beating . And shows speed at unnecessary places . I even watched 2-3 episodes of it believing that it will get better and acting might improve but its all in vane .8/10 rating of this show is only because of the superhero fan who have read all of the flash comics and now seeing it on TV for real .",2015
2,Nothing in this show makes any sense.. This proves to me that American television is getting dumber and less creative by the month!,2014
1,"I just can't take this show seriously. In a nutshell, its bad. I'll keep watching because I'm that type of junkie. Sure it's entertaining however this is NOT quality entertainment. I value it only for its ""comedic"" value.",2015
9,i usually get quite bored of super hero TV shows but this is authentic and amazing. the first season is nail biting and the second season is just as good. the characters are good and the acting is excellent. it has witty comedy and the action sequences are impressive unlike some other superhero shows it does not get repetitive and banal it stays and maintains it's content throughout. Watch it ... just watch it,2017
1,"I sort of liked the first season of the flash. Its goofy, fun, entertaining, and its a happy nice show. The acting is not always good, the script pretty crappy, and nothing makes sense and I do not like the Caitlin and Cisco characters and there are plenty more to complain about in the first season, but just enjoy the ride and do not overthink it and the first season is worth a watch. Season 1 is perhaps a 5. ",2016
4,"While The Flash isn't truly awful, it's certainly not up there with the good TV programmes.",2016
8,"Barry Allen was introduced during ""Arrow"" season 2, which was the show in its prime. After setting him up in the universe, they went on to make a show based entirely around Barry Allen becoming The Flash. Since ""Arrow"" was getting darker and darker, ""The Flash"" went in the opposite direction. It's the tonal antithesis of ""Arrow"". Lighthearted, quirky, and silly, yet grounded enough to make us care, and the writing is just as sharp and witty as you'd hope.",2016
5,"Season 1 of The Flash was exceptional with everything needed in a Sci-fi Action Thriller. Good story line with exciting twists and a superhero, what else do we need. But since the start of season 2, it has gone from bad to terrible numerous times. Bad acting, dismal plot and sometimes hilarious CGI didn't help its cause either. In the era of exceptional CGI in TV, with shows like GoT and Viking, this looks like a B-Grade Sci-fi movie.",2017
8,"I was intrigued by the promos for this series, but after watching the pilot I was afraid it was a dud. But after a shaky start it quickly gained its footing. The action is cheesy, the characters have yet to dig beneath their surfaces, but in the meantime, this show provides some wonderfully quirky storytelling. To me it's reminiscent of the very early seasons of Buffy or Stargate SG-1. The production value isn't great, but not in a bad way -- it adds to the charm.",2015
10,"After reading the bad reviews here, I had to chime in. Most of these reviewers have obviously never watched the movies, because the first movie predates all the shows they say the library is ripping off (except Indiana Jones of course). ",2014
10,"Okay so I had to make a profile to say this about this show, NO it is not a knock of Warehouse 13, that came out in 2009, the first Librarian movie came out in 2004, the concept was knocked off by Warehouse 13, do your research. Now on to the show!",2014
10,"Realizing that The Librarians spawned from the same minds that created Leverage, I was not surprised (pleasantly) in seeing the resemblance between the two television shows. I loved Leverage due to its character development past the traditional ""task-oriented"" crack-team setup. The characters grew close with each other as the show progressed and their antics never stopped coming. I predict that the Librarians will be the same way, and I love that each character in this show has their own quirkiness about them. I also appreciated that the show's creator did not confine the Librarians to the stereotypical nerds plagued with social awkwardness and anxiety issues. These are well thought-out individuals with their own types of personalities. ",2014
8,"From time to time it seems like a TV show like this has been done before, regardless of a previous movie, people may even start thinking warehouse 13 when they watch this show, aside from the similarity's, this show is fresh and easy to watch and is packed with entertainment.",2015
8,"Having watched both of the opening episodes, and the original movies this show spun off from, I can say that this show will be a perfect alternative for families looking to escape reality TV.",2014
7,"I wasn't sure what to expect firing up the Librarians. It's got some elements of Dr. Who (sci fi), Indiana Jones(adventure), and Harry Potter in it (magic). Sound ambitious? Well not really. The show is extremely light hearted to a point it hurts the shows potential. ",2014
9,"I have to start by saying I haven't had the opportunity, yet, to see the ""Librarian"" movies. Still, surprisingly, I didn't found difficult to understand the premise of this show; and the characters that were part of the movies, and also appeared in the pilot, were introduced in a manner that a ""new"" viewer would understand who was who without the show loosing its rhythm. This is also my very first review so bare with me if is not up to standard. I get there's a lot of negative reviews to this show either by people considering it inferior to the movies, in the first season Noah Wyle is ""just"" a star guest (due to his other show is still being shot) but he is the producer and he promises to have a bigger participation if there is a season two; others claim is just a rip off of several other shows; others don't like the actors. To each their own, you should evaluate by yourself. This show is, above all, a parody of many other shows and movies, it should be seen like that, the show doesn't take itself seriously, so should't you. Is not the kind of show you see for the great special effects, for the amazing and innovative dialog or plot. You see it for the humor it puts in parodying other movies and shows. Of course the fights aren't perfectly choreographed, they're mocking the ones that actual are (the suspension of disbelief is more often used in the latter than in the first), there's a friendly wink of the eyed towards the audience, sort of ""you know, no matter how, the hero always wins the fight, right?"". I found the actors/characters have good chemistry and they are having their own development.- Also, both as part of the main cast or as guests, there's some serious names starring on this show. Finally is a show who doesn't recur to swearing, gore violence or such to entertain us, is good, simple, honest fun, suitable for the entire family. Sadly there aren't many shows of whom we can say the same, are there. Please, see it first before reaching a conclusion.",2015
9,"I loved the Librarian movies and really thought the show would not be as good without Noah Wiley in each episode, and I have to admit when the ""Library"" Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain disappeared in the first episode I did not give the series very much hope,but it really turned out to be a good show with some great special effects. I especially loved the Christmas episode with guest star Bruce Campbell and making the idea of Santa Claus what it should really be ""peace and good will"". My only complaint about the show is that Christian Kane cut his hair! that I wish Christian Kane had not cut his hair - I really miss seeing him with his long beautiful ""locks"", but other than that - great show and hope it comes back this summer because only 10 episodes was not really a full season -- and everyone knows we need quality TV during the summer!",2015
1,"Well after reading the plot and seeing a few ads i thought, ""This could be entertaining. Artifacts, mythology,some magic and a group of ""protectors""."" But sadly, after watching the first 10 mnts, expectations dropped quite fast. Just so much unnecessary BS. I mean, 20 mnts in, we got terrorists setting a nuclear bomb, an artifact really well hidden under some SS blankets(sarcasm), ninjas and cowboys, a really weak attempt at a ""good will hunting"" janitor/genius character, some dude playing the next-gen ""that dude in a tube from power rangers"", and some Asian kid robbing a museum with a smart phone. At this point i would be laughing like crazy, if that was the show direction, but no, its all actually somewhat ""serious"".",2014
2,"Awkwardness. In all things this show is bad. Choreography is horrible, action is cheesy, story premise is flimsy and acting is 'meh'.",2014
4,"I tried really hard to like this show. The best way to describe this series is to compare it to Wharehouse 13, with less substance in the storyline department and adding more substance to the comedy area. What we end up having is a show that is trying too hard to be funny where it should be taking more of that time and investing it into a solid base of plot. When you have a show that hasn't established a decent amount of time into providing a good background into its characters and the overall story's explanation you get something that is a mismatch of skits and story arcs that are hard to follow and truly understand.",2015
1,"The Lost room, then Warehouse 13, and now The Librarians....",2014
7,"Never having watched the movies this series were based on I went into this series with the sole understanding it was a fantasy series about magic. That's about the simplest summary there is really, it is an enjoyable, family friendly fantasy. There are moments of humour and Acton to keep you interested, the plots are simple and fun but don't stand up to any logical critique.",2015
8,"I'm enjoying the show. I happen to have watched the movies so I can understand if people are turned off by not knowing what is going on....but I can't understand why they aren't capable of watching the movies; or at least the final movie which clocks in at 93 minutes, the equivalent of a 2-hour episode.",2015
2,"I was looking forward to this show, but the pilot was dire. It was like they'd used a story Warehouse 13 had binned. I've loved Christian Kane since Angel so I was most disappointed. At first it was quite a surprise to see Noah Wyle acting like a mad professor, but that wore thin after 5 minutes and just became irritating, though I gather he will only be making intermittent appearances in future episodes. I was hoping for more of an Indiana Jones type approach to this series, and maybe if the writers had produced a more serious and well researched script it could have worked. Maybe kids will enjoy it, I don't know.... I won't wax lyrical about how bad the first 2 episodes are, so I'll sum them up in one word; moronic.",2014
10,12/08/2014,2014
9,OK this is a show that I love to watch the humor is fun and playful the action is very fast moving and full force and oh the history lessons you learn here my favorite has to be sweet Sandra she's spunky and funny very positive attitude I love that the action is good but the show its self is very family friendly is a perfect watch for the family to enjoy together with plenty of the adventure and romance that keeps your interest a good lesson in team work watching the group work together and have fun doing it though the team doesn't always work well together they come to the conclusion of the problems by the end of the show as long as your kids are old enough to understand the difference between real life and fantasy the show should be a good choice for everyone,2016
4,First there was the government storage in Indiana Jones. And before that the whole Adventure pulp genre...,2014
1,"Well, after watching 7 episodes of the first season, I've realised that this show is unbearable. The target audience is obviously kids up to 10 years old. But even for kids this show seems to be boring. It reminded me Power Rangers plus some stupid humour, very old and amateurish effects from the kid shows of early seventies and some kind of reference to magic. Even if we consider only kids as a target audience, it cannot be justified to make this type of shows nowadays when the filming technology uses computers. Oh, Harry Potter would die in such environment, either from laugh or from grievance. And guys, is this the kind of humour you really enjoy??? The only positive thing in the series is watching Rebecca Romijn.",2015
1,"TNT's The Librarians is a new series based on the made-for-TV movies starring Noah Wyle as a librarian protecting the world from magic artifacts.

1,Honestly don't waste your time on this!,2014
8,"I commented on this show 3 months before it went to Air after I had seen a dozen or so promo clips and read a few reviews and said it should be as good or better than the movies. Well I was wrong, It's much MUCH better and I am looking forward to adding it to my Action/Adventure series. ",2014
9,I came in with trepidation. The whole premise is preposterous. How wrong could I have been? Turns out very.,2014
9,"Coming from a country that airs cheap telenovela, it's refreshing to watch an improved everything of what a telenovela should be. ",2014
9,"It's presented in a comedic style that isn't meant to be taken seriously. I've seen others that commented that there was nothing funny about the situation and wondered why she didn't sue the doctor....as I stated....it is a COMEDY. If this were a reality show, it would have to involve lawyers, investigators and medical professionals. Nothing about this show feels like reality. It is presented as entertainment. I found it entertaining. It is based on an earlier Spanish version that had the lead character as a 17 year old girl, which is way more realistic if she is supposed to be a virgin. However the fact that the lead in this version is 24 adds to the humor. How many 24 year old educated attractive women in a serious relationship with a guy in law enforcement determined to stay a virgin until marriage could there be? Just saying....I think if you like a good mystery (this show also has suspense) and satire, I think this show is worth checking out. It doesn't hurt that all the actors are very attractive.",2014
9,"After completing the first season of this show, I have to say it's definitely one of my favorites. It's interesting and not something typical of other shows, since the storyline is so twisted. There for awhile, it felt like keeping up with everything that was happening in the season was going to be difficult, but it's definitely not if it is something that you find interesting. If you find it interesting, you'll be glued to the TV/computer until you finish it, and then bawl your eyes out, maybe. It's not too hard to keep up with, but the storyline is unique and perfect for those who are in their late teens through early 30's, in my personal opinion.",2015
10,"I absolutely love this, the Spanish and English, the funny jokes, the chemistry all of it. Finally something Latin that I love to watch. I'm hooked. Love it. Why aren't there more funny shows like this ? I hate having to wait until Monday to watch it but it's worth the wait. I also like the fact that they showcase certain traditions that Latin families still try to keep in this generation. I just simply enjoy the show and I've even gotten friends and family to watch. I have to say that my favorite Characters are Jane, the grandmother, the mother and of course Rafael. The dialog is fun to watch and you can relate to some of the characters also.",2014
9,"I stumble on this show and the name grabbed my attention so I decided to watch one episode...then another one...and the rest is history. It is a really good comedy show, a bit chaotic at times, but very entertaining. I truly love the Telenova Star (he is so good looking and play his part so well) and as well with Daddy Baby Rafaela - another pretty good looking dude! ",2017
7,"Have just binged watched over the last couple of weeks, from episode 1 to episode 29 and sadly, as fun as the beginning was--it is on a slow and steady decline. It is clearly a telenovela, and amusing as such. A definite departure from credibility, but fun. ",2015
8,"I have a disclaimer, ""I do not like soaps at all"". Every soap that I accidentally saw growing up with my family made me realize why I hated soaps. Why am I telling all this? Because ""Jane the Virgin"", is unlike any other soap I have ever seen. Most soaps are boring, tedious, unnecessary twists, stretched, overly dramatic and too serious or trying too hard to be funny. The best thing about this show is that it avoids all of these mistakes.",2015
1,"So guess what? In this TV series it is possible to be a mother of a three weeks baby, go to grad school full time, not have to work for a second and have two sexy men chasing you continuously, even after you telling them that you love them both. Ohhh did I forget to mention that both men re filthy rich? And one is a sexy, caring, romantic policeman???? Yeah, thats what Im saying, GET A GRIP!",2015
7,This is a thoughtful evenly paced comedy that is not a laugh a minute. It feels more like a light hearted drama. If you are looking for a Big Bang Theory laugh a minute thing then this isn't right.,2015

10,"I am in love with ""Jane the Virgin"". I think it is a great show that portrays the Hispanic/Latino culture. I am not offended by this show because it definitely represents many aspects from my culture. This show represents the telenovelas just how the are ""full of drama"" and I love it! Jane the Virgin makes me want to look forward to my Mondays and although it was gone for more than a month I still look forward to seeing it. Gina Rodriguez, Jaime Camil and all the cast make a wonderful team and I as a viewer can tell how much chemistry there is between Jane and Micheal and Jane and Rafael. I love it! I hope they continue to renew the seasons because this show has become my favorite show :)",2015
10,"This series is basically a Spanish, soap opera parody. The narrator is the biggest and first clue. He will guide viewers into the scenes and episode scenario. From my perspective, he is there to help people who haven't seen Spanish soap operas. They put the characters into random emotional scenarios, except they're not so emotional. For example, the father comes into the daughters life after a 20+ year abstinence. In a soap opera, there would be crying and ""where were you my whole life"" drama. In Jane the Virgin, the father attempts to make that happen, but it fails hilariously. He goes out of his way to make it dramatically, but it ends up as an adult conversation over coffee. The biggest thing that makes this a parody is the fact the father is a Spanish soap opera star. There are scenes from his TV show that depict the stereo type soap opera drama, and this lets the viewer to compare it to the story. It is this compare and contrast that I love about the show. There are way to many dumb and horrible parody movies/TV shows. They always take it too far with the parody jokes. This show takes it good standard. It is believable, rational standard, and thus adds comedic humor to it. Every new episode I wonder, what dramatically event will appear, and how will they handle it rationally.",2014
10,"Phenomenal and incredibly well-written. I completed entire Season 1 with in a week and still can't get over this show from my head. I am so glad i came across this series. It has lot of elements combined and it tickles your funny bone and quite a stress-reliever. very light-hearted series which keeps you get more and more addicted for every single episode. Entire Cast has performed exceptionally well. Justin Baldoni, Gina Rodriguez, Yael Grobglas, Ivonne Coll, Brett Dier, Jaime Camil, Vanessa Merrell and Veronica Merrell are top in my favorites list from the show. I am totally addicted to this series. Keep going!! Waiting for more and more seasons of ""Jane the Virgin"".",2016
10,"absolutely love ""Jane The Virgin"" tonight was the first episode and Gina Rodriguez is awesome in it! She is an excellent actress and portrays ""Jane"" in a true to life and wholesome manner. The supporting cast surrounding Gina is top notch too! The show looks like it's gonna be a hit and people really need to watch this show and give the Latin community the support to show that they can be more than second class citizens in the entertainment world. I can see ""Jane The Virgin"" on the air for seasons to come . I really enjoyed how Janes grandmother had the flower in Janes hand and made her crush the flower and told her to put the flower back together and Jane said she couldn't put it back together and the grandmother said you can get your virginity back, that was great. Give this show a chance you will not be disappointed.",2014
8,"I really really like this show - it's so funny, but the creators should find some consultant about Czech Republic!!! I am from Czech Republic and Czech people don't like when someone is thinking we are Russian (because of the bad history we have with Russia). So it makes me sad that in this great show are so many mistakes. For example: 1) Magda's accent is Russian - Czech people don't have an accent like that when they try to speak English 2) when the Czech characters speak ""Czech"", they are using so many Russian words - and the languages are not the same (not even close) 3) ""the traditional Czech wedding""(hope it's not a spoiler) WHAT?! They may have a weddings like that in Russia, but in Czech Republic we don't have some ugly traditional dress and hat for the bride and weird suit for the groom. It wasn't even funny. And there are so many more... I hope the creators could do something about it, because it spoils this great show for people who know something about Czech Republic.",2015
2,"Everything was fine until they've killed off Michael's character.Now that he's (Michael) dead, it's quite obvious that a little hussy (Jane)will find another daddy for her son, and that's where I exit. ""Michael"", and ""Jane"" somehow clicked together, and if producers of the show can kill off an important character this easy, then all I have to say is Adios Jane, y vaya con Dios!!",2017
8,I have only watched the first season of Jane the Virgin but I found it extremely hilarious! This show is super charming but it definitely has quite a bit of suspense. Jane is such a sweetheart and loves wholeheartedly! Her mother and grandmother truly make the show with their humor and motherly advice. Jane's relationships with Michael and Rafael get pretty complicated but they add just the right amount of drama to the show. I would recommend this show to anybody who enjoys drama and comedy! Some parts of the show are very action packed but others are full of heartfelt moments! Jane goes on a crazy roller coaster of emotions throughout the show but you'll love to watch her transformation!,2016
1,"i really can't understand people watching soap opera, must have nothing else to do! And seriously where is there any humor in the show?! Ridiculous writing and plot lines... she is a virgin and she is pregnant with a man she once kissed! Aw no! and the doctor is a lesbian and has an adventure with her father's wife, so hot! Of course let's put some lesbian act, that's the tendency right ? It would touch a larger public... It just sends the idea that even if the wife might be lesbian she's still having sex with a man because she's so bad and has an agenda of course ;) I watched it because I discovered Bridget Regan was playing in it but how sad I felt to see her in that role, wasting her talent?! It touches a very specific kind of public and if it's what pleases the majority of us, then it is scary. This show has nothing positive to bring us, moving on...",2015
5,"Now i really did enjoy this show. I loved the culture of the Latino household and relationships between parent and child, grandparent and grandchild. The fun add ons from the narrator makes the show even more humorous than it already is. All the characters however imperfect are endearing except for the title character Ms. Jane Gloriana Villanueva. With every episode she gets more painful to watch. The actress playing Jane does a terrible job by portraying a supposedly devout godfearing good human being as an aggressive, selfish overbearing personality and has driven me and my friends to stop watching one of our previously favorite TV shows. So previously an 8.5, I now give it a 5 and will never watch this show again.",2017
1,I have tried so hard to like this show but find it impossible! I am totally convinced that the only people who have rated this show well are relatives of the cast! ,2015
1,"Honestly, the show is just any other Latino soap opera ever made, just this time translated to English and being so pumped up by the media that it is impossible to escape. If there was a spam filter for TV commercials, this would be the first show I would add to the list, yet it keeps using all sources to be presented as ""the best show ever"" while the plot is awful, the story is cheesy, acting is dreadful and even spending 5 minutes watching it is a complete torture to intelligence and a waste of time. ",2015
6,"The Good: This show started out really well, from my standpoint. A little bit corny, a bit campy, but it didn't shy away from it. In fact, it embraced the fact that the dad Rogelio is a telenovela star. I loved the fact that it mixes with the unique blend that is Florida...a bit English, a bit Mexican, and a bit Cuban. The romance is in the air, and the language flows naturally between English and Spanish, with subtitles that allow you to carry the conversation. (I also love that every once in a while they DON'T provide the subtitles where it isn't essential. It makes me want to learn Spanish, and I don't live anywhere close to the Mexican border!) The plot follows the growing relationship between Rafael and Jane, and I wanted them to find their way together!",2015

5,"Having read ""The Maze Runner"" by James Dashner, I can say that this movie heavily disappointed me. The storyline was barely stuck to at all, and so many important details were altered, and I don't doubt that they are going to have huge consequences for them in making ""The Scorch Trials"" and so on. ",2015
1,The trailer got me into the cinema and it wasn't even at the halfway point that I realized I'd made a mistake. ,2014
7,"For a film that is budgeted at merely 34 million dollars, this film visually looks really good. For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called 'set pieces' were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that's a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn't overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are.",2015
3,"While I was happy to finally see a male-oriented film series – and yeah, even before the last half hour of ""To Be Continued!"" scenes – in a female dominated marketplace (the Twilight ""saga,"" The Hunger Games and Divergent) this movie all-but completely blew.",2014
8,"So I've read a lot of people dissing the movie, and I don't find it that bad. Maybe the book was better. Boy, doesn't that happen enough? The cinematography is good, the effects are good, the clichés are there. ",2014
4,"I went into this film with low expectations. Having never read any of James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I left the theater laughing. And not in a good way.",2014
2,"I guess I'm kind of a traditionalist, because I like a story to build, including the part where you get to know the characters at least a little bit.",2014
4,"The movie is watchable and perhaps entertaining, but my wife did not like it at all. We both like thrillers, but this one was questionable at best as such.",2014
7,"It's rare for a big movie studio to trust the future of a potential blockbuster franchise to a brand-new director. You'd imagine that there would be just too much at stake when it came to translating James Dashner's series of best-selling dystopian novels to the silver screen. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full- length feature film. It's true that the narrative gets a little away from him by the end, making less sense as more secrets are revealed. But this is more a problem with the source material than Ball's own skills as a director.",2014
8,what can i say. i LOVED this film. ,2014
6,"Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait sequel with great interest.",2014
5,"Wow, I really anticipated on this movie, suspense, action, the unknown, it all sounds very exciting. Now I must say that I have seen some very good movies and series round this theme that may influence my judgment, for example The Cube (1 - 3), Persons Unknown, Saw, etc. all have a person or group of persons who don't know how they get there or how to get away. How is it possible that those movies, some dating from 1997, are so much better then a 2014 movie? And being almost 2 hours long, how come so little happens in those 2 hours? Some reviewers already mentioned the contradictory and illogical elements in this movie, and yes, this does this movie, with such much potential, not much good, it's just annoying to see them not try what is so logic. The movie is entertaining, but leaves you very unsatisfied.",2014
6,"The Maze Runner is definitely not the worst teenage-directed dystopian flick out there (I believe that Divergent has that one locked down), but it is definitely not the best, either. Its setup is interesting and builds adequate suspense to keep us watching with slightly interested eyes, but it falls apart with its repeated, clichéd, TV drama like dialogue. It serves to forward the plot, but often tends to show little of anything, really. And it happens a lot. Most of the film is spent talking, mostly about the maze as a sacred, untouchable thing that no one should go into under the consequence of death by the monsters that lurk within the maze. The action, when it happens, is fun, but it doesn't happen often enough.",2015
7,The film The Maze Runner is based off the three book series written by author James Dashner.,2014
4,Maze Runner borrows all its beats from other films. There's nothing original here. This is an obvious ploy to take us for a ride and this recycled crap is what is wrong with Hollywood.,2014
1,"I wasn't sure whether to watch ""Annabelle"" or ""The Maze Runner"" and the only reason I chose this one was because it got higher rating than the other. Didn't expect much of it and assumed it would be a little childish just by looking at the poster, ie, my expectations were not high to begin with. But seriously, how can such a crappy movie like this get a rating above 7 ?? The beginning of the film went okey (not good, just okey). The first 20~30 minutes, I watched expecting to see what would come next. But then gradually, my impression of the movie was; ""Seriously?"" ""What the heck!!"" ""They've got to be kidding!"" ""Is it just going to get worse?"" ""Can it get anymore tedious and stupid?"" ""Oh, gosh it's just ridiculous!"" ""What kind of moron made this??"" (by two thirds of the movie, I started looking around to see if I could find the exit just to walk out)",2014
1,Sad that this rates well with todays youth.,2014
10,"I actually liked this movie. As I watched this movie I was somewhat reminded of The Lord of the Flies, but with a lot of science fiction thrown in there. Yes, this movie has flaws, but what movie doesn't? Is it believable? No, but so what. Is Star Wars, The Avengers, Batman, Captain America, and The Hunger Games believable? No. I have read a lot of reviews on here that pan this movie, but that's just it...it is only a movie. Just sit back and let yourself enjoy the fantasy. And if it was really that bad why would they be making a sequel? It must have done well at the box office. I bought the DVD for my son, and I am sure that he will enjoy it more than I did.",2014
7,"This movie when not compared to James Dashners book is wonderful. The cinematography is wonderful, the script is great, and the acting is even better. I admit I might be biased on the acting part my favorite actor stars in this movie. Here are the reasons its not good.",2014
7,"I can see I am in the minority here, but, to be honest, I found the film to be quite intriguing and exciting. I went into the movie ""cold"", not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn't try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I'd be better off.",2014
1,"I know it's a sin to rate a movie a 1 because if someone really likes a movie, it ruins that person's day, but I hate this film. If you really love this movie, that's great, and I'm sorry about your day.",2015
2,"Well what can I say, I was forced to see this by my daughter, we wanted to see the new Dracula untold, I thought the idea sounded OK until the movie started that is, it was quite boring to say the least. No one entered the maze until a fare chunk of the movie had already passed, the title should of been called ""field talker"" because that's what they did for the most part. I can't fault the acting or camera work but I can fault the script, seems like its just another teenage book made into a movie to cash in on the craze of making movies from books, (it's long been suggested that Hollywood has no original ideas left and copy books and movie ideas from foreign movie makers) To add to my disappointment the movie didn't end but pretty much says to be continued, what? I sat through this crap for them to tell me that I'm up for another $8.50 to see what happens next, The guy from ""meet the millers"" who's also in another great new (English) movie called ""plastic"" should be ashamed of being involved in this commercial drivel. Average rating of 7.4 what!",2014
8,"Based on the best-selling YA novel, The Maze Runner is the newest, and  one of largest adaptions to arrive in cinemas yet. Comparable to The  Hunger Games and Twilight, it is in fairly good chances to be the next  big franchise. Here is what we thought of it;  Setting the tone immediately, lead star Dylan O'Brien awakens suddenly  in a very dark and eerie lift travelling from deep below the ground, it  becomes apparent that he now knows just as much as we do. The fear is  visual and quite real  and just like a young child on our first day of  school we are pushed into a new, confusing experience for the next two  hours.  Arriving atop the lift and unable to remember anything other than his  name, Thomas. He is told by a group of teenage boys that he is in a  field in the centre of a maze, called the 'Glade', where they all live.  Having attempted to find a way out many times, all they know is that  the maze is open during the day-time, and closed at night where it  periodically changes and is protected by fearsome creatures called  'grievers'. Anyone in there at that time has never returned.  Much like an episode of Lost meeting The Lord of the Flies meeting  Labyrinth, we understand narrative at the same time as Thomas, who is  eventually told that three years ago a young teenage boy first arrived  at the glade, and each month since one more arrives in the lift with  certain supplies to survive. Unknowing of why and unable to escape they  have become helplessly trapped there since. Similarly to The Lord of  the Flies, the group of boys, all probably aged 10-20 have creating a  living-area, created rules, swearwords and the imperative code to  'never go beyond those walls' - but as Thomas arrives at the glade all  seems to change for the worse, and many of the other 'Gladers' take  note.  Admittedly we had not read the book until after we had saw the film,  but from the very first paragraph we noted its book-to-screen accuracy.  Fans of the book will be more than satisfied with the minimal changes,  and any made are for the better.  The film, upheld by a ninety-nine percent teen cast, feels news and  many of the actors are in roles unseen before. Dylan O'Brien, From TV's  Teen-Wolf, provides an exceptional lead role as Thomas and carries the  film in both story and emotional trawls. Although new to the setting  and with the films entirety taking place over just a few days, he  comfortably fits in, although ruffling many traditions too. At one  point it is said 'I don't know if he is brave or stupid, but we need  more of him'.  Co-staring alongside Dylan O'Brien are equally exceptional performances  by; Will Poulter, in a dark tough-guy role, (and absolutely nothing  like his recent role as Kenny in We're The Millar's); Thomas  Brodie-Sangster stars as a fellow Glader; and Kaya Scodelario in a  surprise turn-up as the first female at the Glade - but also 'the last  one ever' to arrive. Although the narrative between them is conflicting  at times, the chemistry is smooth as if friends both on-and-off the  screen. Notably, we can confirm that the characters live-up the book  creations and are almost perfectly cast.  Evidentially former director/writer/editor/effects maestro, Wes Ball  uses skills from his previous work on this film and it shows and flows  evenly. Take note future producers, this is how to successfully make a  YA adaption, which surprisingly, is just as impressive as the book. Yet  unfortunately leaves us with far more questions than answers by the  end. Based on the trilogy by James Dashner expect more answers to  follow in sequel movies in the soon to be massive franchise. Or, you  know  you can read the books before hand? Ultimately, you do not have  to be a fan of the books, or even a YA to enjoy the film it, it has  something for almost everyone.  The Maze Runner arrives in US cinemas 19th September, and UK cinemas on  10th October. Be sure to check back soon and read our exclusive  interview with director Wes Ball, and leading cast; Dylan O'Brien, Will  Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Brace yourselves Maze Runner fans!",2014
10,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. ",2014
10,"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.",2014
10,This show is fantastic. Both Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are stellar and the rest of the cast are amazing. Every person gives meaning to there character. The story is dark but it never gets to dark. It adds some humor every now and then which is done well. Also there is not a lot of Action so if your looking for a Action filled series this is not for you. Dialogue is well written you can tell that a lot of time was put into the shows script. Cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping they have some beautiful shots in the first 3 episodes. There is 0 shaky cam for those that hate it. I hope this show has a long run because it's fantastic and it really stands out from the rest of the crime shows out right now. Overall I recommend this show to people that are looking for a stellar story. Absolutely brilliant 10/10,2014
10,"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. This is one of the finest debuts after the end of the behemoth that was Breaking Bad. It is, however, darker, sinister and more tense than BB's first season, boasting the same level of uncanny actor performance... Mcconaughey's character is a multi layered, conflict ridden pessimistic, walking black whole with a uniform and a brilliant mind, Harrelson plays the family man cop with a bigger heart and a down to earth perspective - the clashes of both ways of life are amazing and when both actors discuss deep topics, each with his own take on life, it's as good as anything they've ever played. The story is shocking and still simple so far (only first episode has aired at the time of this review) which it makes up for in the awesomeness of the pagan thematic, it leaves plenty of hints and cliff hangers at the end of the first episode so there may still be very interesting twists to it. Directing is exemplar in shots, pace, dialogue and I even enjoy the color balance. Editing is phenomenal too. Very highly recommended!",2014
10,"Of course, I knew that HBO was putting this out there. What I didn't expect was to be hooked from the opening titles. Atmospheric, moody, moving at the laconic pace of South (not to be confused with slow). We, as viewers, are watching the story unfold just as the characters do. Harrelson and McConaughey are simply and elegantly perfect, playing off of each other to the perfect degree. The cinematography is stellar, as is the story as it begins to unfold. I had no idea what I was in for when I turned it on, but I'm hooked, and can't wait for the next and the next and the next...secrets abound, tantalizing clues are everywhere, but where do they lead. I'm can't wait to find out.",2014
8,"Ever since the Sopranos raised the bar, we have been treated to some great TV shows this past 10-15 years, & with True Detective, the latest offering from HBO, i think we might just have another beauty. When you have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson playing the leads, the hope & expectation rises & judging by first viewing, they look like they wont disappoint. They are both very different characters, we get to know how they were in the 90s, and how they have changed into the present day, and how they both have individual issues. The overall feel of the show is a little dark, but the mood seems perfect for the show & the cast compliment this brilliantly so far. The bar as been set by a number of shows in recent times, but initial impressions, and with this duo leading the line, True Detective could well be right up there in the future.",2014
10,"After just watching tonight's series premiere episode of ""True Detective"" on HBO, I can already tell this is going to be a fantastic show. It kept me interested and almost forced my attention the entire hour. It is already beginning to build a complex plot so make sure to pay attention to the details. All the elements of a brilliant show are at hand here. The writing, the acting, the scenery, the plot. Everything, from what I have seen so far, is amazing. The show has this dark, eerie feel to it which I love. McConaughey and Harrelson deliver great performances. Do not watch if you aren't into complex plots. But otherwise, I strongly suggest giving this one a go.",2014
10,Wow. That is seriously all I can say after watching the first episode. The episode is amazing. Will definitely be tuning in again and so will you. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey do a great job. The script is very well written and drives the story hard. This show is all about the story. It has the feel of a mini series not a TV show so it will be interesting to see where it goes. But it is one powerful script that is acted out great. This is the first 10/10 I think I have given on IMDb. Once you watch it you will know why. I will be shocked it this show does not win awards. It may be the best show on HBO now and I would say it's up there with orphan black with it's ability to grab your attention and keep you glued.,2014
5,"So hard to give this a rating. The first year it was a 10/10. The second year it is a 1/10. I kept thinking I was missing something. I started out by recording the series and after 1 1/2 episodes, I had to cancel.",2015

7,"Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.",2015
2,"The first season was critically acclaimed, and with good reason... It had great acting, fascinating characters, and an intriguing storyline that drew you in and kept you interested. Admittedly, Season 2 had some big shoes to fill, but instead of continuing with their winning formula, the creators decided to make things exaggerated and overdone. The Season 2 characters are insincere, unlikeable and overdeveloped, with every possible problem, obsession and kink to make them appear edgy and dangerous. Instead they come off as silly and contrived. The acting is also atrocious, which is surprising coming from solid performers like Farrell and McAdams. Vince Vaughn is especially bad, and always appears as though he is doing a parody on SNL and will drop the punch line at any moment. Perhaps some of the bad acting can be blamed on the ridiculous script, particularly evident during the scene between Farrell's character and his attorney (""I welcome judgement.""), and the one between McAdams and her father. You almost get the feeling that you are watching a B-movie worthy of Tom Sizemore and Steven Bauer, it's that bad. Even without high expectations, the second season is a big fail on all counts and will disappoint all but the undiscerning viewer.",2015
1,"Season 1 was phenomenal! If you don't freaking read so much into this show and pick apart every little detail, you will be entertained and pleased. My opinion may be biased because I believe that Matthew M and Woody H are both great actors and were perfectly cast together. They have a chemistry on screen that is very believable and so enthralling. The story line is generic, and somewhat predictable, but the acting is what draws you in. ",2015
10,"A truly remarkable visceral experience that captured my attention from the very beginning. Through the tumultuous adventures of Hart and Cohle I was finally able to appreciate what is my favourite television series to date. I was riveted and thoroughly invested in the series until the very end and several sequences in the finale episode left me shuddering with emotions that I haven't experienced before. It would be a sin not to watch this show. The thematic vision behind this body of work is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such ideas so thoroughly and seamlessly to actual film is bewildering to say the least. To Nic Pizzolatto, the cast and the crew I am indebted to you for bringing this to the world, thank you.",2014

1,"Even though I objected to the portrayal of my beloved Louisianan as a state filled with incestuous, dimwitted swamp people, I loved Season 1. I awaited Season 2 with excited anticipation. The opening credits greatly impressed me with mysterious graphics and a theme song of which I never tired. The first episode was a jumble of meaningless stories that seemed to have no connection, but we have all seen this technique used before. I told myself that I simply had to wait and everything would become clear as the story unfolded. The cast was beyond impressive, so I kept watching and waiting for the characters, any characters to have a shred of appeal. In eight episodes, I never cared one tiny bit about any of them or the worlds they were trying so hard to hold together. The tag line is ""You Get the World You Deserve"" and they certainly did. Where Season 1 enticed the viewer into a frightening and strange world that seems to have been reclaimed by the magical forces of nature, Season 2 drags the viewer at gunpoint into a man-made cesspool populated by equally worthless creatures who deserve that world. More than a few times, I found that I was playing solitaire out of boredom and had to go back to see if I had missed something that might make me care about anything that was going on. I never did find a thing. The best part about this series, besides some of the music, was that it finally came to an end.",2015
10,"It's very rare that I tell a friend that a TV show blew me away, but that's exactly what I said when discussing the 3rd episode with a friend. I've been watching the show from the first episode and after each one I sit back and think how special this show is. I watched 'The Wire' and 'Breaking Bad' in their entirety, but 'True Detective' surpasses them both. The performances of the lead actors, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson is masterful. The personal failings of their characters is brilliantly portrayed as is the interaction between the pair. The plot is very interesting, but what really makes the show is the lead actors. Matthew McConaughey especially gives the performance of his life to date. I'd never considered him a great actor prior to this, but he holds the screen and enthralls the. viewer with his broken, but intelligent and dogged character I get board by long reviews, so I'll end, but if you like character studies, a good plot and great direction, then give 'True Detective' a try. You will not be disappointed.",2014
5,"Trying to watch E2, it's pain indeed. The first episode ...hmmm, hoped it's just intro, let's see.... This episode (02) is absolutely hopeless. As someone wrote before, already the intro music is a torture. Good cast, in theory only, actors are lost, none of those rather experienced professional has a clue where to take the character. The direction is a disaster, hard to figure out if the script is any good, perhaps it is/was and the director screwed it up. I am writing this to warn potential victims and because I am bored, the episode runs as I write but once I got that minimum of review words will switch it off, as I guess it will only get worse.",2015
1,"I was always taught that you should try something at least twice before saying you don't like it. Well after watching three episodes of TD Season 2, I can honestly say I don't like it. I'm so disappointed after being such a fan of Season 1. Months ago when I read about the casting for Season 2, I started to get worried but decided I would keep an open mind but Season 2 is just so ridiculous there is no saving it. I keep asking myself how the show could go bad so quickly. Was Season 1 just a fluke? Was Season 1 so intriguing and amazing because of the supreme acting skills of McConaughey & Harrelson? Whatever the reason, this show has definitely tanked in Season 2. There are so many things that are absolutely ridiculous about Season 2 it's bordering on being comical  The writing is just ridiculous.come on ""I'm feeling apoplectic"" really?  The look that Rachel McAdams is sporting is a total FAIL! Ridiculous unkempt hair doesn't make you tough.  I don't even know what to say about what Vaughn, Ferrell & Kitsch are trying to do but it's all bad.  The ridiculous Vegas singer in the light blue suit of the latest episode",2015
5,"Not sure how you create a masterpiece such as season one, and then lose you way, to the extent they did, with season two. I realize it must be ridiculously difficult to follow up something like season one, which is as good as television has been in decades. It was monumental. The writing was superb. The monologues were gorgeous. Not so with season two. It felt as if the writing team had left the room. There was only one monologue in one episode that made me even sit up and take notice. Vaughn was excellent. He really did a good job. But, he did not have that much to work with. And the ending? Come on. They could have done a lot better than that. They did what they could to match the darkness of season one. But, they could simply not create the kind of environment they created in the Bayou, in Los Angeles. It felt like a sort of contrived darkness. And by using scenes of downtown Los Angeles, as the city of Vinci, they kind of lost me. It was not enough of an effort. Kind of a sad follow up. Just did not have the heart and soul of the first season.",2015
2,It is not the same as the first season.,2015
1,Just watched the pilot of /Scorpion.,2014
2,"* The characters talk about how socially inept the ""geniuses"" are yet they're well dressed in hip clothes (even the nerdiest is retro chíc) and cool hats and speak with lots of snarky urban slang and they're more confident than used car salesmen. And they're all rather short for some reason. What's up with that? ",2014
1,"I seldom write reviews but I feel compelled to for this show because I couldn't believe what I was watching. The scorpion team have 25 minutes to save the world from a plunging satellite. In that time they make a magnetic pulse device from microwaves, drive it to a field, perform a long series of incredibly complex mathematical calculations, inflate a weather balloon, ascend to 30,000 feet (wearing nothing but parkas which aren't even zipped up), fire the device, lose a parachute and have several romantic encounters on the way, AND the whole thing took longer than 25 minutes. The only reason I watched for that amount of time was because I couldn't believe what I was seeing! The characters are one dimensional, the plot is ridiculous, the actors are trying too hard, the 'technology', if that's the right word to use, is ... Words fail me at this point.",2015
1,"I just finished watching the pilot and was so infuriated by how dumb the show is I made an account just to make a review. For an episode that involves technology and hacking, you would think the creators would at least run the premise by someone with a basic understanding of computers or you know, common sense. Lets list a few of these dumb things:",2014

2,"I thought this would be a thrilling show of intelligence (y'know, like the sort of 'Beautiful Mind'-type imaginary), but no. The pilot, with the 'car chasing plane', Con Air-esque mess, just told me not to proceed with this...but, I did, and it didn't get any better. The characters are boring and unlikeable, and Happy Quinn with the voice of a precocious, pre-pubescent boy - ughhhh - it's borderline creepy. Walter is no less irritating (maybe too strong a word, considering he evokes no real emotion in me), with his poker-faced enthusiasm. Why is 'normal' portrayed as the clichéd single mother, working for tips, trying to prove her worth in the world? High hopes! DASHED. What a shame.",2015
1,"I see a lot of reviews here saying ""It's just television, it doesn't have to be realistic, just entertaining"" - as if that was an excuse for bad writing. But there is no excuse for the mindbogglingly awful writing exhibited in the pilot of Scorpion.",2014
3,I bought into the trailers; I was interested. But this show was a mess.,2014
3,"It has been said that Scorpion is the ""smartest show on television"" but that isn't a boast I'd want to make public. Television is not the place to go for thought-provoking content. T.V. is where you go to watch insipid sitcoms, brain-dead reality shows and dog-and-pony award ceremonies all slathered with a skewed reality from the Bible Belt.",2014
1,"Who writes this stuff? This was the worst plot and story line ever. No technical advice seemed to be present. Dumbest show ever. That's not how aviation or airlines work. That's not how communications in the real aviation world work. Where did these writers come up with this fantasy garbage? The problems go on and on with the writing on this pilot episode. Additionally, the electrical box? Really? A train switching station? Come on writers. Do a little homework. Hire a few consultants. It's every bit as bad as snakes on a plane. Stupid, stupid stupid. The female a actor who plays the electrical genius has no acting skill. The message of poor geniuses is also tired and run out. Your choice of math genius is pathetic. Is this the best that CBS can do for the new season? I would rather be at the dentist office then be forced to watch another episode of this show.",2014
1,This is probably the most ridiculous show I have ever seen. The Scorpion team invents their own reality to function in. I wouldn't be surprised if they built a time machine out of old coffee makers while incorrectly citing some science loosely related to what they were doing.,2016
2,"This was disappointing. I liked the characters and the show's premise had potential. The plot however, was so contrived and so divorced from reality that I had to stop watching after the 10th time I shouted ""That's not the way that works!"" at the TV.",2014
3,"Where to begin...made-up names for technologies (Slow Servers, routing hubs and the list goes on), inaccurate uses and capabilities of existing technology are just for starters (typing a few keys and windows pop-up and scrolling text, rj-45 cables dangling from jetliners). I won't rehash a lot of what the other reviews have posted, other than to state that this quite possibly the most technically inaccurate show on TV today. If this show was satire or something based in an alternate reality that would be one thing, but this supposed to be based on present day.",2014
1,"I really wanted to like this. The premise is good. The actual writing/directing is bad. The actors are fine, but it's more like a kids show you would see on PBS, but with live action instead of animation. I predict it will be canceled soon. ",2014
1,"This show may have ""promise"", and the actors involved may be talented, but the script was less believable than Sharknado.",2014
1,"Let's compare Scorpion to a show like CSI. CSI has an intelligent script, is well acted and generally keeps the viewer immersed in suspense. CSI has a feel to it that adds a layer of depth. There is some humor and the characters are varying degrees of like-able. ",2014
1,"So I gave this title a shot. I knew it would be false hope to assume the best, but I gave it a shot any ways the benefit of doubt that MAYBE it's good. ",2014
1,"This is like car crash TV, it's so bad I just have to keep watching! Where to start....well Walter O'Brien. Supposedly he's based on the real Walter O'Brien - who is about 20 stones at least. The character of Walter is a thin, not unattractive guy with no personality at all. A genius apparently, who simply cannot relate to anyone who isn't a genius. If this was based on the real guy then there's no way in the world his team would ever work.",2015
2,"This show is so ridiculously full of technical errors and dumb clichés and stereotypes that I thought maybe it was supposed to be comedy. It's nearly a parody of itself, but fails to be funny too. In order to get past a few minutes of this show you will need to know nothing about: Aircraft, standard two-way radios, computers, the internet, or pretty much anything. ",2014
4,This show is simply bad. I decided to watch 2nd episode but was left disappointed as with the first one.,2014
1,"I keep going back to this show in the hope that they've fixed it, but lets see, in the latest(spoilers), the national reserve is hacked with ransom-ware, using something called a quantum, which is a unstable super super computer that uses lasers, only lasts a random few days, any extra heat, or vibration, or anything, and it explodes. They can't stop the ransom-ware, the code changes too fast to hack, so they have to break into the lab it's in, use stolen spacesuits to survive the -100C room, drill a hole in the Plexiglas after coating the bit with butane to seal the hole so air doesn't get in, put a foil mirror on a stick through the airtight hole, to reflect one of the lasers back to the cube to slow down the quantum so a flash drive with the anti- ransom-ware can be installed.",2015
1,"It would be fun to write a spoiler. Every line out of virtually every actor is incredibly stupid. It would be fun to list the technical problems line by line, but I don't have the patience or the time, and I'm sure there must be some limit in this rating system that would cut me short of the 253 pages that would be necessary.",2014
2,"The only aspect about this show that is surprisingly good is that it managed to get 7.2 (Jan 2015) on IMDb, an INCREDIBLY HIGH score for its quality! To me, the whole show looks like a C category work, done to boost the myth (fraud) of Walter O'Brien. ",2015
3,I despised the last Fast and the Furious movie almost entirely because of the impossible and nonsensical scenes. This made that look like an award winning hit.,2014

9,"I've recently been reading (actually listening to the audio-books) the Outlander series of books having completed 5 so far so when I saw the Starz TV series was coming out I just had to watch it. I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). ",2014
10,"For the past 23 years, Outlander has been a presence in my life. Have read it countless times, in fact started it again just yesterday. I am proud and humbled to be One of the Original Seven Ladies of Lallybroch, associated with one of the very first global groups devoted to Diana Gabaldon and The Books. For decades, the idea of a cinematic version of The Books has teased and taunted us, flirting with our imaginations and hopes. Now, it is here. And here it is. Every detail is brilliant - script, costumes, sets, and yes, the actors. The Series is a visual companion to The Books, and a boon companion it is. It is also an adaptation, not a verbatim recitation. Fidelity to our beloved characters and story is assured by the continuing involvement of Diana in the creative process. She fiercely protects her story and, in the process, her fans - which are both legion and legend. Caitriona Balfe truly IS Claire, as Sam Heughan IS Jamie. A cup up to Ron Moore, Maril Davis, and the entire crew (Terry for the amazing costumes)for giving us Our Outlander...",2014
10,"I have been a fan, make that obsessed fan, from the first book. There are now eight BIG books in the series along with The Lord John series and a few novellas. I've read them all numerous times. I was hesitant about TV show ruining the books but Starz and Ron D. Moore have shown that you can use a book's dialog and make the actors fit into the characters and make a marvelous show.",2014
10,I never read the books and never heard anything about this story before I saw the show. I don't know how close it comes to the books but as a show is absolutely fantastic.,2014
10,"Everything about EP1 is wonderful. I'm a fan of the book series and I'm happy that Ron D. Moore is at the helm of this project. I think the casting of the lead roles is perfect. The locations and sets evoke each of the time periods portrayed. The music is amazing; it adds character to the events as they unfold and I'm looking forward to hearing more in later episodes. There is some criticism about the pace of EP1, I agree that it felt a bit slow. Viewers who feel it's too slow, please note that the book is about 800 pages long! Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the show and I believe new viewers who give it a chance over the next several EPs as the action in the story picks up won't be disappointed and will appreciate what all the fan fuss is about.",2014
10,"Having discovered Gabalton's novels only recently (generally reserving my limited reading time to the likes of Bernard Cornwell and Patrick O'Brien, more swords;less romance),I was pleased with the quality of the production, casting, pace and overall presentation of this complex story. Romantic? Yes. However, if the mini-series story line continues in keeping with the books (as seems likely)it will likely unfold into dovetailing themes of sacrifice,duty,honor,jealousies and complex loyalties that even many of the male viewers will relate wholeheartedly to. Not since PeterJackson's close to the novel(s) rendition of the Lord of the Rings saga have I been as pleased (at least with the initial installment) with a book-to-screen version of a great story. Thanks STARZ!",2014

10,"Based on viewing only the first episode I think this is a wonderful adaptation of a much loved series of books. Starz have brought the words of Diana Gabaldon to life in a remarkable feast of Scottishness which will satisfy the legions of fans all round the world. A much anticipated series, the first episode, which was made available free by Starz on You Tube, sees Claire, a world war 2 nurse being transported back through time to Scotland prior to the a battle of Culloden where she meets Jamie and Captain Randall, two very different men who will come to play a large part in her life. Much lament in some countries however who do not receive the Starz cable channel, as to when we may see the rest of the series. A story which must not be missed.",2014
10,"Wow! This series, I expected to watch it and enjoy. I have read all of the Gabaldan books and thought there is no way that anyone could pull off the love story between Jamie and Claire. When the casting news came out I thought - not sure about the choices of Heughnan and Balfe. I was wrong.",2015
10,"Although I have only seen the first episode so far, I have to say I really enjoyed it. Having read the book many, many years ago I was curious to see how the characters would be portrayed. I wasn't disappointed as the cast have been well chosen and I can't wait to watch the rest of the series. Set in WWII I was impressed with the attention to detail and I thought the whole thing was well made and I am certainly impressed. I thought Jamie was perfect for the part and Claire too, they both looked just as I imagined inside my head. Well done to everyone who has been involved in the making of this series. I can't wait for more!",2014

1,"The first few episodes were more or less intelligently done and the acting is good throughout. But towards the end the show deteriorates into unwatchable torture porn. If you have any humanity in you, you can't watch about half the scenes of the penultimate and final episodes. I read somewhere that the makers peddle a nonsensical rationalization of the graphic, horrific scenes of rape and torture. They claim that they wanted to show how hard it is to deal with trauma, alone and inside a relationship. Bullocks. It's torture and rape porn, and it's bad for your soul. ",2016

Then I jumped to episode 16 and also watched an extremely long scene where Jamie Fraser is punished by captain Randall. Enough! I really consider such sadomasochist scenes unnecessary and unacceptable. I'm not a moralist. I do consider nudity, sex, some violence and even some porn in an adult movie or TV series, but such levels of sadomasochism, unnecessary bloodthirstiness and savageness are intolerable. This kind of TV Series is not recommendable for normal persons.",2017

Also can you tell us where have the actors/actress been hiding, EVERY one of them deserve at least an Oscar, opened our eyes to facts re the battle of Culloden, bucket list coming up, places to go all the sites/castles featured, we love Scotland anyway, so that won't be a hardship.

I am a fan of Breaking bad ! there is nothing wrong with violence if you know how to use it, and of course, if the TV show have something else. You can not even rescue a single dialogue !

2,"""Pretty"" is the only positive comment I can think of after having just suffered through the first episode. The Scottish backdrop is gorgeous and the performers are predictably attractive. The plot is an incredibly cliché mix of young adult fantasy and harlequin romance. Now that combo could have worked, but unfortunately that possibility was killed by the poor pacing of the story. The...pace ... is ... GLACIAL. So slow. The first dull hour I watched only had enough story for twenty minutes of film at best. What's even more annoying is that much of the outrageous padding is due to the almost constant narration that stretches out every non-dialog scene. Its tedious and redundant, adding to nothing but the running time. The entire first episode could have easily been edited down to 20 minutes. Zzxxxxxxxxx zzzzzzzzzz",2014
10,Note: this is a chick flick series. Do not bother if you're more Star Trek than Pride and Prejudice. Also the review was posted by a thirty-year-old hungover woman with tears of the season 2 finale still streaming down her face. I'm biased. Don't judge me.,2016
2,"The love story between Claire and Jaime is what sold me on the story when I first read it all those many, many years ago. Having it in old time Scotland was simply icing on the cake. I've read all the books: the first being my favorite. I LOVE Jaime, and am still not totally sold on the actor playing him. Whether or not he is Jaime to Gabaldon, he's not quite him yet to me.

It's more than anything I've ever saw from Television so far and I'm Speechless. The violence is used for this series is almost enough to not be scared about and is not more than you expect to be a drama series. In years I saw so many police dramas from different networks, Criminal Minds, Justified, The Closer, Copper, Cracked, Crossing Lines and Dexter, but this is different. The idea is fresh, the casts are Good, the plot is not Predictable (I think because I just saw the pilot), directing was good, visual effects are astonishing and the series is so far building to my expectations. I cannot wait to see more. Hope this will be continues in next episodes. 10/10.",2014

However, there is a lot of background on the main leader of the cops from Chicago Fire in which he was really presented as a bad guy. A lot of that has since been slightly washed down although he certainly does things that other conventional cop shows don't show. Which is one of the main things that makes this show good.",2014
4,"Watched the pilot episode and will not be watching any more. This had a promising first couple of minutes but soon descended into a very predictable and frankly unconvincing, introduction to the main characters. Action scenes although containing a lot of violence were weak and unconvincing the two be-headings looking very much like a window display in a second rate Halloween goods store. The dialogue seemed to rotate in a very predictable fashion between the characters given that everyone in each scene seemed to speak in strict rotation with very little evidence of any attempt at spontaneity. I suppose I should watch a few more episodes but I cannot honestly see how that after such a disappointing pilot it could ever achieve any more depth.",2014
10,"I'm not going to even lie, I was a little skeptical at first about this show. However, after watching it the first couple of weeks, I was really impressed. I started to find myself enjoying the show much more than I expected. I like the fact that all of the characters have a story line. Chicago Fire was already a great show but I like how the producer incorporates both shows together. Detective Voight was not my favorite person in the world when I first encountered him. However, after watching the show this First season, he is my favorite actor on the show now. Chicago PD is starting to become my favorite show on television. The action is great along with the characters!",2014

10,"FINALLY a great TV show...I'm sick to death of reality TV, my life is reality, I watch TV to get away from reality... it's about time they brought TV back to what it's suppose to be, entertaining! This show has it all, it's full of action, with a side of funny, and a dose of crime. I think the TV people need to find a way to better calculate their ¨ratings¨ bc more & more people, like myself, watch TV online. I watch ALL my TV online & if your ratings were accurate Chicago PD would be off the charts with how many times I've watched each episode, it's basically on a running loop on my computer now. So let's hope the networks get smart & figure out a better way to get their ¨ratings.¨ There aren't many shows that you like all the cast members, there's usually someone you don't really like but I love everyone on this show. Great Casting Job... LOVE LOVE LOVE Jason Beghe... Give me a badge a gun and I'll be Voights ¨dirty¨ sidekick in a heartbeat lol We'd clean up Chicago. Great Job NBC, now don't screw it up. ---- OK, so after reading all the comments I feel the need to ¨re-comment¨...Lets start with Voight, ya he did a crappy thing on Chicago Fire, he also went to jail for it, this show is his 2nd chance,(people do deserve them) you can tell he thrives on catching the bad guy & will go the distance to do it, he's a little aggressive lol but definitely the kind of cop I'd want handling a case for me(lets think about it, has he ever abused the rights of an innocent?...no) ;) He's a great lead!! Those of you who actually believe your cops do things by the book are naive & have never gone through the system. The system is corrupt no matter how innocent you are, if they want you to be guilty, you are guilty! TO: ¨wallow¨ this is LIFE, maybe you live where its all unicorns & rainbows but most people don't, sounds like you need to get out of the house & if you don't like cop shows anyways then your opinion doesn't really matter. To: less than a minute, god help us if we all act like u! Would that be church TV for all? Does every show need to OK it with whatever city they are basing a show on? Disclaimers for everyone? Geeez Louise! To cliché 101, what cop show does have believable cops? If the cast is ugly who's gonna watch? At least they put realistic shoes on Sophia Bush. Watch Criminal Minds, CSI, L&O SVU & the lady cops are wearing 5 inch heels running down the street, now that's unbelievable. Angry and insulted eh? I think you need counselling, it's just TV, then again you do watch Rizzoli & Isles so that explains a lot. Now that show sucks! To must miss TV: This show is actually a little different from the same ole cop shows, but how different can you make them? Cops fight crime, not like they can go spice it up & send them to fight fires or have them out tap dancing in the streets *rolling my eyes* To very unconvincing: If this show is receiving so many high ratings but you don't like it, what does that say about your taste? Then again you're from the UK & I've watched UK TV, it's like watching a homemade movie in slow motion. TO PD Poor... The story lines are awesome... Dialogue unbelievable? WTH? It's only had 11 episodes, how much can a character develop, geeez give it a chance. It's an action/drama, not suspense! This is not a soap, they are tough cops doing a tough job, no slowing down. So they don't have time to all gather around, cry & sing kumbaya for Jewells. How can Seda's wife be pushing him away? She's been in the show twice? Are you for real? Some people just like to complain. I just felt like responding to some of the most ridiculous comments I've ever heard about a TV show. IT IS TV PEOPLE!! NOT REALITY!",2014
1,"This show is downright painful to watch. The characters and what passes for a plot appears to have been lifted directly from cop shows of the '80s. Might as well call it ""The Last Remake of Hill Street Blues"". What worked some 30 years ago absolutely does not work for this pathetic string of clichés that's pretending to be a TV show.",2014
3,"I wanted to try this one after Chicago Fire, as I really liked the show. I expected Chicago PD to be different, as it focuses on police investigations. But to my surprise, it revolves around a team of hot- headed cops with no ethics, bordering on extreme clichés.",2016
2,Yet another cop series set in Chicago this time which takes a dirty cop who first appeared in the excellent Chicago fire. Everything that is bad and over the top in cop shows is in this one. The lead actor overacts and you can see his face contorting as he tries to keep up his gravelly accent.,2014
1,"The casting department obviously felt the need to hire a few hunks to continue in the vein of Chicago Fire, and to set up romances down the line. The problem with this, in my opinion, is that I didn't believe any of them as cops. The vibe is just ""off"". You have the ""is he good or is he bad"" lead in Jason Beghe, who shows, of course, that he has a good heart, no matter what else he does. You have the two ""hunky"" guys, one of whom engages in an altercation that almost made me laugh out loud (his macho moment). You have the girl who looks like she's 15, and I believe she's gone through all the training to be where she is like I believe in the Tooth Fairy. You have the ""grizzly"" street guy (who I actually liked the best), and you have the ""mother,"" who I didn't believe was a cop either.",2014
1,I don't know why anyone would want to watch this show; but I tried just to make sure I gave it a chance. I suppose if you are sympathetic to Dirty Cops doing awful things to people you will like this show. They took the most Despicable character from Chicago Fire and decided to write a series around him. I could only force myself to watch about 15 minutes before I couldn't take it anymore. I am not crazy about most cop shows anyway because they seem to focus on the worst parts of life and wallow in it; but this one has nothing else to balance the filth. Maybe there is some kind of Redemption that the writers have planned; but I don't like the characters enough to care and would just as soon see them get what they deserve.,2014
1,"This show would be great except for one thing. They are constantly breaking the law by assaulting or torturing suspects after they are in custody, lying, or committing many other felonies in pursuit of justice. They have a lynch mob mentality on this show and are (if this was reality) Always violating peoples rights. How can anyone be okay with this? Well I'm not okay with this at all not one little bit. Almost every episode shows the lead people who you would hope the be good examples going outside or above the law beating on or torturing suspects to get the job done. This is totally bullchit and can not be allowed anymore.",2016
5,"If only the director would instruct his actors to speak intelligibly this show would be lot more enjoyable. Sophia Bush, who is a very attractive decent actress, seems to intentionally attempt to make her voice husky and low which is great but she is often unintelligible. For this reason alone I no longer record the show. It's just too annoying to have to strain to hear what is being said. It could be so much better. The episodes are really interesting and I like all the action but wish there was more emphasis on projecting, which I believe is a basic acting tool. Even Voight,who has a very husky voice, projects his voice and doesn't mumble. Laroyce Hawkins as Officer Atwood also needs to speak up and enunciate. The show would be a lot better.",2015
1,We managed 2 episodes of Season 1. The second episode we only watched to see if it was as bad as the first.,2017
10,"I love this show very much. I am in the fire department so I like watching Chicago Fire also. I agree with another user who commented about third watch it is the best show on Police officers out there. Even though Chicago PD is clearly a drama along with Chicago Fire they really make you jump out of your seat and think a lot. Third Watch is a drama that took place in NYC in the early 2000s, and had to deal with the FDNY, FDNY EMS, AND NYPD. I highly recommend both Chicago Fire and Chicago PD, it is a very addictive show. Third Watch is just like it and is as awesome and intense! Rookie Blue is a show about Cops too, it takes place in Toronto but it reminds me of Chicago PD so much. Season 5 of Rookie Blue starts on May 19th and I can't wait!! It has been going since 2010 and is still going! I hope they go to make at least 8 seasons. I recommend all of these TV shows and all 4 of them have me hooked and I can't stop watching the episodes while they're playing. Chicago Fire and Chicago PD run through around September, October - May while Rookie Blue runs May- September! So it's year round of awesome TV shows.",2014
10,"Highly watchable: brilliant casting, characters and acting, lots of raw action and a good many genuinely moving moments as cops put their lives on the line to put away (or down!) an endless stream of very bad people. Personal relationships are well-handled, too. Among my favorite current/recent shows along with ""Longmire"". Well done, USA TV. You guys are GOOD.",2017
9,"You don't have to have seen the original Coen film to enjoy this series, nor does it spoil anything for you if you have seen it: the new TV-show 'Fargo' is entirely its own beast. So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.",2014
10,"From the very start, from the opening shot of the cold dark icy road and the background music starting to play, I knew this would be something different, something awesome.",2014
9,"Six months ago I finished watching Breaking Bad and I really think that's the best thing I've ever watched and I always felt it is nonpareil in terms of excitement. From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.",2015
3,I enjoyed the first two series but this third series was a shambles. I feel that the creators literally lost the plot before shooting and decided to have fun with the public and see how far they could push the whole Fargo shtick while making it up as they went along . ,2017
10,Im here once again to state the difference between a show and a masterpiece .,2015
9,"Since Breaking Bad ended i have been craving for something as good, so let me share the good news with you guys. This show is it. ",2014
10,"I just finished watching the pilot for this show, and it was a ""wow"", a top notch level of excellence.",2014
10,"I'm not good with reviews but i decided to give it a try, i was boring, watching TV show after TV show, everything was average at most. Then I tried another one, Fargo and I was so tied with the story and great acting that I watched all 8 episodes during one night, recommending to everyone!",2014
1,To be as brief as I can although I liked season 3 the ending was a disappointment. Why? 1. Varga who has been the criminal mastermind for the entire season walks into an obvious trap. He would never have been that stupid. 2. Nikki Swango has endless amounts of time to prepare the entire warehouse for the ambush but forgets to turn off the CCTV cameras?? 3. Emmet Stussy's car breaks down in the middle of the highway. After Nikki and the cop kill each other he gets in his car and just drives off without a problem??? But it was broken down! Ridiculous. Did no one re-read or edit the script before submitting? Were they in a hurry? These glaring mistakes destroyed the ending for me and were so strange since everything else was so well written. So while it was fun to watch I have given it only one star for the bad ending.,2017
10,"After watching more recent offspring of the new ""One hour movie"" esq shows ,ushered in by Breaking Bad, I was expecting a pretentious, exuberantly high budgeted, slow and pandering television show trying to feed off the Breaking Bad withdrawn audience. After watching the first episode of Fargo I was very surprised. ",2014
7,This is a great example of a TV show that cannot sustain it's quality after a couple of series. The first couple look great with some good acting and strong story lines but the third series falls apart.,2017
9,"I loved the movie. And with the first episode, I fell for the series, too. As new episodes played, my heart skipped many beats and lo & behold, it ended without a bang. While, at least 5 episodes are a full 10/10 for me, the finale failed to spark.",2014
1,"I have to acknowledge the fabulous cast in Fargo Season 3, however the story line this time around was a bust! I loved all the previous Fargo's and waited anxiously for each new episode. This season was actually painful to finish. From the first episode I held on , assuming it to just improve each week. Not the case, in fact I found myself finishing up the series like it was a chore to just get done. So disappointed.",2017
9,"The premiere episode of the 10 part mini series for Fargo is off to an overwhelming start. I was filled with joy to first discover the Coen Bros. masterpiece Fargo was set to be remade with characters and setting reminiscent of its predecessor. Conversely I was a little hesitant as Fargo was notorious for encapsulating a dark, sardonic environment bursting with near bravure acting, and this mini series may taint the well known image it has created.",2014
10,Fargo is great.,2014
3,Like many of the reviewers I thoroughly enjoyed the first two series and was anticipating another epic when season three came out.,2017
1,"What the **** did I just spent two evenings watching?? After two brilliant seasons of Fargo, I've got a bitter taste in my mouth after the third. For all of you people who like inconclusive endings, this will be a goldmine - go for it, but for the rest of us, this was a total waste of time.",2017
7,"This show is such a disappointment. I really wanted to like it since I have a deep respect for the lead actors but it simply doesn't have it. After watching True Detective I sure make comparisons between the two and the bottom line is that Fargo looks simply mediocre in comparison. The writing isn't as good, the premise isn't as interesting, the pacing is questionable at best and at the end it simply doesn't make any sense. It tries too hard to be quirky to the point I felt simply baffled but not amused. At the end I watched the last two episodes just because I could while I was working not because I was interested or something. It's just meh.",2014
2,"The acting is very nice but the script is shallow, over the top and pointless when you look at it from beginning to the end as a whole.",2015
2,"After seeing the brilliant Season 1 and 2, Season 3 was nothing but a disgrace. A shameful insult of viewers' rationality and patience. Like a child with no manners shitting everywhere, and thinking that because we love it so much we will tolerate anything it does. I literally have to force myself to finish it, only holding on to the hope that it will live up to its name, but it didn't.",2017
6,"I loved the original Fargo the movie. However I hated the more recent No Country For Old Man, directed by Coen bros too. So my expectations for this remake is 50% hopeful 50% cynical. I'm up to date with the latest episode, here's my feedback...",2014
9,"I was very sceptical when I first heard that they were going to reboot Fargo, because it is such a popular thing now to reboot movies into TV shows. Most of these movie to TV reboots have either been a disappointment or just 'ok' (From dusk till dawn was a disaster. Bates motel is not great. Hannibal is okay. and many more like it.).",2014
10,"it is definitely one of the best first-episode TV series that i have seen and i'v seen a lot.so if it gets better episode by episode,i'm absolutely sure that it will be one of the top ten series of all time and in crime-drama genre maybe just maybe as good as True Detective.now about the first episode,the plot is dark,cold and a little funny(in a dark way i mean) but it's not that mysterious like true detective was.the acting is solid,all the cast do a great job to make scenes believable,the reason i mention believable is that,after watching the first episode you might find it difficult to find sense and good reason behind some scenes but i believe that crazy people do crazy stuff and ordinary people do unexpected things under pressure and stress and if the actors and actresses achieve those characteristics which i think they did then the scene is believable.anyway the writing is compelling and solid that keep you interested and it is also complicated enough to make good crime characters which i think is very important in a crime-fiction.overall if you like crime genres,then i highly recommend it.",2014
9,Great pilot.,2014
10,"Wow! Fantastic! Murder, mayhem plus over-the-top hilarious Minnesota-speak. If you liked the movie, you're gonna like this too. First TV episode had more action and maybe a little less comedy in the dialogue/dialect of the movie, but the Coen Bros. influence is omnipresent. One concern I have is that if the murder rate continues (4 dead in episode 1), they're gonna run outta characters by mid-season. But let's trust show's writers to overcome this hazard. Observation on Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton character): maybe it's my imagination, but I see some of Anton Chigurh (""No Country for Old Men"" bad guy) in Malvo. Both are obviously sociopathic hit men whose ""work"" doubles as entertainment. To wit: Chigurh shoots at the crow while crossing the bridge, the fun and games with the coin toss; Malvo antagonizes one of Hess brothers against the other with fake ""lawyer"" phone call. Later he cons the motel janitor kid into pissing in the owner's gas tank, then makes anonymous phone call to owner to catch kid in the act. My hat is off to FX for coming up with this magnificent replacement for the season ended ""Justified"". Fingers crossed that subsequent episodes are as entertaining as No. 1. P.S. - Can't wait for somebody to haul a wood chipper outta the shed!",2014
10,Seriously stick with this show. I watch a lot of TV and when I first started watching the 100 I found the dialogue/accuracy questionable and it seemed like just another CW show. I stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept.,2015
8,"I started watching this because had nothing to do. First impression, low budget acting and mediocre scripters. But surprisingly, I got hooked. This show is actually good!",2014
7,Before watching the 100 you have to accept the obvious: it is a drama put on by the CW (the same folks that brought you 90210) about a group of 100 teens left stranded on earth by a society that has been living in space for a century. It is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the 40 minutes it takes to watch an episode. ,2014
8,"The series was off to a slow start, but it is getting better and better. The premise is original and fun, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on, it seems it gets darker each episode, but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully, without too much gore. Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW's typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It's a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque. ",2014
10,"I've read a couple of these reviews, both negative and positive. I agree with both. Yes, there are definitely holes and I too believe it has a slow start. That being said, it wasn't slow enough to make me not watch the second episode, or the one after that. You have to appreciate it for what it is. It has an allure, the concept is what makes it interesting. I can poke holes in every well liked show, as i'm sure many others can. I kept watching because I felt the show had potential, no matter what route it took. There are still things that irk me about this show, but the things i enjoy outweigh the things I don't. ",2014
1,"This show is unimaginably stupid. The only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction. With their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet, the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science. The list of plot holes in this show is unending. The writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by Paige Turco's holographic eye mascara.",2015
9,"I have to say it started a bit weak, but now I am completely addicted! Yes there are some cringe worth moments, but give it a go... the last episode was a complete turning point, and I personally cannot wait for the next episode.",2014
8,"OK, so I'm not going to waffle on about how bad the script is and how many plot holes there are to this show as I think from a run through of a number of reviews on this site... That bit is covered!",2014
8,"First off, I enjoyed Season 1 of The 100. Season 3 was inferior compared to other seasons.",2016
10,"I was not at all into this genre of TV shows/movies, more into the comedies. So I was randomly browsing Netflix and started watching The 100, and what can I say...I got hooked to it.",2014
1,"The premise is already bad. It's post-apocalyptic SciFi getting the Young Adult treatment. The show is yet another attempt to cash in on the Twilight formula of taking what used to be nerd-fodder (fantasy, horror, sci-fi) and turning it into teenage/highschool drama nonsense.",2014
10,"The first two episodes have piqued my interest so far and are good sci-fi. It's a best series out there right now, and it's the only current one I've watched lately. I just hope it doesn't have too many moral twists in it, but going back to watch ones that do is the norm too.",2014
1,"*spoilers ahead* Yet another show with a ""good idea"" that doesn't hold up due to terrible writing.",2014
10,I was forced to watch first two episodes by my teenage child. I was disgusted by plot holes and teenagers wearing make up after a week in the woods. I suffered through the first season thinking why on earth I'm wasting my time. I'm a big Firefly and Battlestar Galactica fan. The 100 was nothing like it.,2015
1,"Whoever is writing this obviously has no clue how to write good SF, let alone a good story. The premise has merit, but the follow-through is worse than dreadful. Lets see, where do I start . . .",2014
1,I may recommend this show for a 12 year old who doesn't notice things as well as an adult who knows a good TV Show when she/he sees it.,2015
10,"In all honesty, after the two first episodes, me and my wife wanted to quit. The teen characters really got on our nerves. At this point, we would've given a 2/10 rating.",2015
1,"If even one hundred years locked up in a space station cannot pull out a better script, well, maybe it is true that the human race does not deserve to survive! The embarrassment reigns in front of The 100, all minors, who have never been under Earth's gravity and yet they dance like in a rave; the one that has lived under the floor for 16 years, but flawlessly jumps into the first river ever seen by 4 generations; the much-more-than-minor who becomes the leader of the so-bad-that-nastier-you-cannot in 30 seconds; the class conflicts thrown here and there because in 2014 we are all politically committed; the blondest and most known-it-all main character of all times, the short-sighted politician who wants to save the human race, but perhaps does not know what the gene pool is, etc etc ... the list could be infinite . I'm tempted to write that the problem is the age of the protagonists and the target, but recent unfortunate events (see Terra Nova or Revolution) have shown that even if adults are added, the result does not change. It is not that I'm claiming a Doctor Who all days, but really you, you Hollywood screenwriter cannot do anything better than The 100? Do you really think that teenagers from all over the world were not capable of appreciating a well-written and credible sci-fi story?",2014
3,"The story is set after a nuclear apocalypse. Earth is radiated and the rest of humanity is living in a small space station and guess what... it's overpopulated and they run out of air. Some 100 TEENS (!) got sent to earth to check out if there is still radiation. This is dumb, seriously. Oh, I forgot, they are CRIMINAL teens, of course... because in the future they would have a government that sends teenagers into prison for minor crimes... oh yeah, sure... This follows the current trend of ""lightweight"" dystopia like ""The Hunger Games"" or ""Elysium"". That is, a ""dystopia"" stripped of any political, moral or ethical meaning but with a lot teen drama... Todays ""dystopia"" does not have anything in common with ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"", it has stooped to the level of ""Beverly Hills 90210"".",2014
10,"So I don't really know if this review will contain any spoilers, but I check marked just in case. I don't want to spoil too much for those who will watch it. ",2015
1,"This show is so full of continuity errors it's painful to watch. Wounds that heal in seconds, moss that grows on metal, nobody ever gets a concussion, people don't drink water after being lost in a desert, clean shaven men with no razors, ""paralyzed"" legs suddenly able to move and feel pain, fractures being healed by cauterization, Western Red Cedar found on the Eastern United States, mutations being nothing like what radiation actually does to biological systems, etc., etc., etc. etc. etc etc etc. I count at least 20 continuity errors every episode. I don't get why this show got a better rating than Zoo, which is as campy as this show but with better attention to detail, better acting, better writing, and better CGI.",2016
1,"Actually there are probably far more than 100 reasons and I'm not going to list them all here. I'm sure many more will follow in other reviews. But, just to get started, the setup for this show is so preposterous I don't know where to begin. The survivors of a future apocalypse escape an irradiated Earth and live in space stations, where the punishment for any crime ""no matter how small"" is death (apparently mostly Republicans survived the Apocalypse). Except if you are under 18, then you get to live in prison until you are 18, then reviewed, and then presumably, put to death. However, the compassionate adults of the future have decided to send 100 teenagers approaching 18 to the Earth as guinea pigs to monitor their survival. If they die, so what, they were going to be killed anyway. And, as we all know, teenagers would certainly represent the best option for the survival of humanity. So as not to disappoint, the teenagers are self-centered, arrogant, idiots who are completely unaware of what is going on; and completely incapable of any kindness or compassion (who knows, maybe this will change as time goes by, but, this group does not give me any hope for the future). Immediately the kids start to bicker and congregate into uncooperative groups (a sure sign of maturity). So far, the show seems to be about a typical trip to the mall. On the bright side, the adults in this show do not fare much better. Apparently there are no schools on that space station (and from the feel of it, maybe just mind-numbing reruns of reality shows as entertainment). Apparently, and according to all TV shows and movies, the future human race no longer evolves, but devolves into a species of ultra-violent racists, hellbent on annihilation. It does make sense though, that spending a couple years in prison as a teenager would prepare you for immediate expulsion to the surface of a planet that was recently decimated by nuclear war. Oh, and there must be great hair stylists in that prison because The 100 all look like they just stepped out of a salon.",2014
9,"I've never been hooked to a TV show not since ""Lost"". After i read some of the reviews, i gave it a shot. I was checking on what show to watch and find the plot of this show interesting. ",2017
10,"Sci Fi Post Nuclear War Fantasy/ Adventure and overall great show. Just finished binge watching, I really enjoyed the 100 and look forward to season 4. For a show on CW it is really violent and intense. The 100 will feel like a mash up of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Lost"" in the beginning. For me the 100 was easy to get addicted to. So if you give it a shot i hope you can enjoy it as much as me. If you have very moderate expectations i would say you won't be disappointed. It will be rewarding if you get really into a character's story line. And there will be many characters to get hooked to. There will be many fork in the road decision with crazy consequences. Watch the 100 with an open mind and it can take you on a ride. I thought it would really be a show for kids, but i knew right a way the opposite. Do not get spoiled and do not google to much about the show. Enjoy",2016
9,"I must say, if you have an...average opinion of season 1, I don't blame you. The show was decent, good at times but it lacked continuity and it had way too many ""Villain of the week"" scenarios and all the side story lines were seen as irrelevant mostly.",2015
9,"After just two episodes, this show seems to be drawing a lot of negative reviews. However, most of these come from comic-book uber-fans, resentful that there are no capes and masks in the show. Of course, that's exactly the point - this show is about the mythic Gotham *before* it exploded with 'super' heroes and 'super' villains. It uses the dark, surreal *style* of the Batman comics to ask some fascinating questions about morality and the relevance of 'extreme' characters in the real world.",2014
9,"Of late, I have realized that TV content is getting developed much better than movies and I find myself binge-watching many recent TV series than movies. This is happening all the more because of the gripping and taut story lines (TV shows, given their length, used to ramble on about the plot, but thankfully no more) and brilliant overall delivery. ",2015
8,"A show set in the Batman universe.. except without Batman? A lot of people didn't like this concept but i was one of the people who did. I wanted to see the villains' rise to power most of all.. but how would they be interesting with no Batman to counter them? Well that's where the early years of Jim Gordon come into play. The show follows Jim as he cracks strange cases whilst trying to help a young Bruce Wayne solve the mystery of his parents' murder. It seemed each week for a while we would see a new villain come in and act like they run Gotham City before Jim and Harvey Bullock shut them down, but it turned into more than that.",2015
9,"As a pretty engaged Batman fan (I read the comics, played the heck out of the Arkham games, saw all the movies, the first Animated Series and I even play the tabletop miniature game) I was apprehensive about this show.",2016
8,I am actually surprised how much I like this. Its a bit of Goth and a bit of Noir and a bit of Comic-Con rolled in one.,2014
10,"Gotham is basically about how Jim Gordan along with his accomplices solve homicide crimes, etc. If you think it's about Batman, you're wrong. ",2015
10,"At first I didn't know what to make of this... a TV series that's basically a prequel to Batman... no wait... a prequel to Commissioner Gordon with Batman as a side character?! How is that going to work? But, as I watched, the story began to unfold and make sense. The production values are top notch... this looks like another Batman film you'd see in theaters... and the mix of too many bad guys in one movie reminded me a bit of Spiderman 3, but it just worked here. The plot is set up. Everyone is kind of interrelated in this whole mess called Gotham City and we're all waiting with some baited breath not for Batman to arrive, but to see how the bad guys develop around Jim Gordon, who is masterfully played by Ben Mackenzie (who is kind of hot, by the way). One can only guess that, as the series develops, that the mess that is Gotham keeps escalating to a boiling point whereby the caped crusader is truly needed to help Gordon keep Gotham stable.",2014
9,"Just watched the pilot and I daresay I've got a feeling it's gonna be a great success for the production and a treat for the viewers! Pre-Batman era never seemed so awesome! :D The plot seems elaborate and the way the story is spreading and building up suspenses, we can definitely expect a pretty epic ending. And I really don't want the ending to come anytime soon! The cinematography was absolutely awesome. Though it has a distinctive Dark Knight feeling, it also differentiates itself from any other Gotham city. The simultaneous filthy and sophisticated city is given a perfect amalgam of all other Gothams, picking the finest features! The series also has a subtle dark tone in it that really gives you a chill. The score was pretty good even for a movie, and definitely out-stands almost any TV series. The acting was well out of the league. I liked Jim Gordon's cast (Ben McKenzie). Robin Taylor (cast by Oswald Cobblepot) seemed promising too. The large chunk of antagonists would make for a great rivalry. And Falcone might as well turn out to be another mastermind villain like Jim Moriarty! And boy, wouldn't that be something! It's a Batman series without the Batman! Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. For now, Gotham can do with Jim Gordon! :D",2014
4,I was way too excited for this pilot episode; I should have managed my expectations with it being on Fox. ,2014
7,"The acting is bad, especially James Gordon. Most of the actors/actresses are overacting and the dialogues lack depth and consistency.",2014
1,"When a person, who does not quite understand human behavior, writes a story (about humans) it is bound be terrible. This show will feature some of the most unnatural dialogue like, people who know each other will often announce their names without there being a cause to. You will also see a man trying to convince a boy to keep his chin up moments after the boy's parents have been murdered. Note that this man is supposed to be the one who takes care of the boy. And let's not forget the murderer who just happened to feel like shooting two people, for no apparent reason, and then letting their child live, for no apparent reason also. I won't complain about the acting, because they have good actors. It's only that they have to play badly written characters.",2014
9,I can't believe the negative reviews this show is getting despite only airing a couple of episodes?,2014
10,"I'm recommending this show along with Daredevil (Series 1) for anyone who grew up into comic books, even if you outgrew them somewhere around leaving school as I did. At first I was a little annoyed that this might be another its all about a cop's life series, and it is, but it is so much more than that, and besides, in comic book terms, this cop is basically your Lone Ranger or Phantom without the costume. That's also why I liked Daredevil, with Daredevil himself being the cop and severely handicapped at the same time. In both shows the acting is superb. In Gotham the acting is so good one forgets we haven't actually got to the super-villain stage of the Gotham/Batman story. The rise of the Penguin is pure classic rise of a psychopath genius. There's lots of edge of your seat throughout, cleverly employed and resolved. The criminals may not have huge special effects but they are very true to comic classics. The city surrounds photography is also superb. These two factors work marvelously together, negating the need for advanced cgi and creating something very original to television. This show doesn't cheat. It finds alternatives. Successfully. And the good old villains have very classic yet diabolical ways of summoning revenge and summoning trouble. The subtle and not so subtle politics between the villains themselves, and the villains and the cops, and even the cops and the cops, is also cool. The Batman movies of late had that dimension too, also successfully. Even junior Bruce Wayne and Arthur are cool, with Arthur weighing in when he needs too. Everything is larger than life and totally enjoyable, even without cgi.",2017

Within the first few seconds of the Penguin being on the screen somebody says ""Ya know, you look like a penguin."" Within the first few seconds of the Riddler being on the screen, somebody says ""Enough with the riddles."" And Selina Kyle goes by the name ""Kat."" I mean...COME ON!

Aren't we tired of being subjected to the so called hero, heroically letting the scumbag go, so he can kill as many innocents as possible? How about putting a little effort into the writing, directing and presentation of a program to support the excellent acting and special effects most programs have now. How about the characters that are supposed to be experienced professionals behave like it, and if certain outcomes are desired, develop a storyline that actually supports it, instead of taking the lazy path, of having your characters act like idiots, or immature, compulsive preteens.",2014

9,"I saw at least 3 other reviews of this TV show that put it at a 6/10 for the sole reason that it is an inaccurate portrayal of lawyers. Yes, and...? Does that take away from the brilliant plot and acting? I don't think anything in film or television is an accurate portrayal of anything. If someone were to rewrite this exciting show into an ""accurate portrayal"" of law, then it would just be a show about Viola Davis filling out paper work and occasionally showing up in court. And some of these reviewers go on to say that it is a shame that people believe that is how the court of law is in real life. My advice to them is to go to the IMDb page of the Avengers and write a review that says, ""it's a shame that every single person who watches this movie now believes superheroes actually exist,"" because apparently no one who is a consumer of media entertainment has the common sense to know that lawyers do not, in reality, go around killing and bribing everyone.

I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Most crime shows are all about justice, which is great but sometimes it's nice to see the opposite side of things. There's so many dynamic characters in this show, it adds interest. Viola Davis is amazing in this. She's such a strong actress and her acting is very believable and on point. What I will say is, some of the characters seem a bit awkward. Again, I think that's what makes it interesting. The awkward characters have a place and don't seem like a random actress throw into the mix. I find this show, sexy, interesting and very dramatic. It's the perfect mix! I say give it a watch, if you don't like it no harm, no foul.",2014
9,"The most interracial show ever made, seems to be the main theme of the serial. But the plot takes the cherry. The twists through out the story is simply hypnotizing. Even though it is slow at the start, the end pays it off with interest.It seems to have been made with a message of women, gay and other empowerment and is not at all subtle about it. It has Gay sex in every episode..that girls might love. But all these negative points are well outweighed by the the story-line plus acting. Majorly the actor in the lead role ""Anna Keating"". Her work is impeccable. I can't remember the last time I failed to identify the killer beforehand. The director would amaze everyone with the brilliant work. ""How to get away with murder"" there could not be a better title than this.So, watch it right now, bear first few episodes with patience, then drown in its magic. Great Show!!",2015

There's nothing wrong with that. If you don't like the drama, then don't watch this show, because yes, it is unrealistic. But that's what makes it interesting! Please just stop hating on it because realistic everyday lives aren't all that interesting to watch unless they're comedy and some people like drama because we are humans and we simply want the drama. We want those lives because they're exciting, regardless of how unrealistic they are. I LOVE THIS SHOW. It's so interesting and I love finding out what happens next.

8,I just binge watched season one and I loved it. First off I want to say that there are a bunch of complaining critics on here that I think are missing the point of the show. How to get away with murder. It's not a show that's going to depict total reality. It's a fun to watch exaggerated clever show (but there's a bit of truth behind every bit of this exaggeration). Maybe the critics that rate the show so harshly should really watch it with a grain of salt. So many are saying that it's unrealistic. The law schools are not at all like this. Law isn't practiced like this. Oh grow up. The crazy twisting corrupted lying cheating goings-on are exaggerated and accelerated to make it more fun to watch. This is a fun show and I am most certainly looking forward to season two. Now I will agree that there are some gratuitous sex scenes that just really aren't necessary. The writers really don't have to spell it out for us. We get it. Maybe they will ease up on that kind of stuff in season two. Good show and I recommend it to people who are open-minded to the fact that TV doesn't always have to be based on true absolute reality. It's supposed to be entertaining. And this show is definitely entertaining.,2015
3,"Having watched Shonda Rhime's Grey's Anatomy, I was kind of expecting a lot of drama with How to Get Away with Murder. However, having watched several episodes, I'm not liking the way the legal system is being portrayed nor am I enjoying the unnecessary scenes that act as a filler to the script. ",2014
1,"As a lawyer, I was extremely disappointed that nothing this show presents about law school is accurate or even, for that matter, legal. And of course, every law student is an arrogant, narcissistic, nonredeemable idiot. A law professor would never premise a class as showing students how to practice law by focusing on how to acquit a murderer. A law professor would never violate attorney/client privilege by having her students interview a law firm client. Bringing her class into the courtroom to assist her defense, not happening. And on and on. The unfortunate thing is that the undiscriminating viewing audience of typical Shondra Rhimes' crap will eat this all up (and probably believe it is based in fact). This isn't a legal drama, it is juvenilistic pablum that will almost certainly devolve into everyone sleeping with everyone else and something blowing up. Raise the ""bar"" people!",2014
1,"Like one of the other reviewers, I also went to law school. There isn't a thing about this show that plays as real; not the premise, the characters, or the plot. Also like many, I came to this because of Viola Davis. Sad to say, even she can't save it. In fact, in some places she's guilty of some horrible over acting. This is not entirely her fault, as the script is terrible. I kept hoping that there was going to be a break and we would discover that the turgid story and sleazy goings on were just some character's drunken nightmare. No such luck. Spoiler. There is not a single redeeming character in the show. In fact, they're all just widgets for all the evil things that all criminal defense lawyers are supposed to do to get off the guilty.

7,"This is definitely a time to use it. Unlike other ABC shows I used to watch like Desperate Housewives, I never heard a good word about HTGAWM. When Desperate Housewives first appeared there were plaudits and comparisons with Six Feet Under and Sex & The City. Much like DH, this show centres on a mystery (who killed Lila Stangart and how are the main characters going to get away with murder?). Add to that some of the horniest students and professionals I've seen on television since Queer as Folk, you've got a great mix of intrigue, hysteria and mystery. It doesn't pretend to be a good show. It's overblown, it's riddled with over-acting, the plot is paper thin and the court scenes are like cheap episodes of ""The Good Wife."" And it works in the shows favour. It's so good because it never once puts on the front of being a good television show. It's trashy and dirty and Viola Davis is absolutely amazing. If you're needing to wind down after a hard day of actual work, tune in to How To Get Away With Murder and enjoy the petty dramas of an oversexed, over-thinking, overdressed cast. The jury is out - How To Get Away With Murder is guilty! Guilty of being pleasurable.",2015

Plot twists are, according to me, fantastic. And this show has a lot of them. It never fails to surprise. Law is something I have always found fascinating - you get a new case every week and you get to follow Annalise and her students into court while also getting a glimpse into everyone's personal lives. The characters are alike in many ways, but also very unique. You get to see the relationships between the students, between the adults - and of course, between the students and adults. I have always been a big fan of Shonda, she will continue to do great things.",2015
8,"First, let me start by saying I love this show so far. I hate that ""actual"" lawyers gave it 1 star, which is like me saying that since I'm a Soldier, almost every military movie and 98% of all movies involving guns and explosions are garbage because they are not accurate. I won't even go near how they portray the military, totally screw with how the uniforms look and how they show our tactics. Nowhere near the truth! But I understand the writers are not military and there are too many little things under the hood for them to get everything right, as should lawyers when watching this show.",2015

It actually looks very, very promising. I love Viola Davis - she is a fantastic actress. Not sure whether the legal aspects or realistic or not, as others have noted, but that wasn't my issue. Also, the murder that's shown in bits and pieces throughout the episodes was intriguing. I really wanted to know how the characters found themselves in the position they were in. But it was another position entirely that made me give up on the show. ",2017

Highly recommended for viewers whom like courtroom drama and a touch of mystery in their show. This show got me to start an IMDb account just to write this review. This should be enough to tell you how good this show is. Hopefully it stays on TV for a very long time. A+",2014

How does this  trash get on the air? Sex scenes, oral sex, etc. The TV  censors are letting more and more of this crap be shown. And boy is  this show confusing.  I like Viola Davis so gave this show a try and I wish I hadn't. She  plays a ruthless defense attorney who teaches a class on how to be a  great defense attorney.  While this lawyer & professor (Annalise) is upset about her husband's  supposedly infidelity, she was unfaithful herself. Nobody has any kind  of morals on this show; not the lawyer, cop or students.  Possible spoiler I missed the pilot episode so I'm a little confused  about what is going on with her students. Did they kill someone and are  trying to cover it up? Did her husband have an affair and then kill one  of his students? No idea and I don't care as I will never watch this  garbage again.

People would pay to get into the drive-in theater, but they wouldn't go to actually watch that crap, if you get what I mean. Maybe you don't. I can't believe network TV is presenting this stuff as innovative entertainment. It was sleazy junk back then and it's sleazy junk now. The only difference is this generation was raised by puritanical, former sex and drug fiends, so they think this is cutting edge.

2,"From what I've seen of Shonda Rhimes shows I am beginning to feel like she is the TV equivalent of a Harlequin romance writer. I've watched every episode of Scandal and am trying to watch this show. Scandal went off the rails second season with a crazy amount of sex and violence. Rhimes sure does like to mix a story into a bunch of over-the-top violence and sex scenes, which brings us to this new show. How to Get Away with Murder is basically a romance novel on screen. The characters are one-dimensional and unlikable. They exist mostly to provide characters for sex scenes with some thinly plotted murders in the background. Viola Davis is such an amazing actress and her talent is wasted in this role. It's just sad how poorly written material is all over TV and this is becoming our standard. Luckily there are some good shows still on like Motive and BBC's Sherlock, where characters are multi-dimensional and plots actually exist.

The premise is interesting to me: a complex, strong, female law professor and her students tackle ambiguously moral subject matter. But the acting was heavy-handed. Without spoiling anything, there was a scene in which one of the actors changes mood abruptly, which came off more psychopathic than complex. I don't think that was the intention. There was subtlety neither in the acting nor in the directing. There were things that would have been more interesting in allusion rather than in hitting us over the head with graphic imagery. And I know a little about the law (disclaimer: not an attorney), enough to know that very little of the legal stuff was realistic. Reading the other reviews here confirms this. In fact, it was so unrealistic that I just couldn't get past the liberties taken in order to advance the plot. It seems to me that a better director would have known her craft well enough to understand other devices with which to move the story forward, without cheap reinvention of reality.

This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family.

This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene.

The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment.

The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time.

The characters themselves are likable but not great (except for Hera). Kanan isn't that compelling, Ezra is a total copy of Luke, Zep is one-dimensional, Chopper is no R2-D2, and Sabine is a Mandalorian artist (an artist, really). ",2015
4,"After watching the Premiere episode of ""Star Wars: Rebels"" I thought about it and here I wanted to highlight the pros and cons from ""Spark of Rebellion."" ",2014
8,Star Wars Rebels is a Star Wars TV show set between Star Wars 3 and Rogue One. It follows the group of rebels and their fight against the empire while building the rebellion as we know it. While the first season is not fantastic the second and third seasons are defiantly a step in the right direction.,2017
8,"I love Star Wars - the basic premise of an epic universe, battle of good vs evil, classic take on characters and their traits and promoting clean and pure values...Most of us love (or have loved) Star Wars for those reasons.",2014
10,"Unlike most fans of the classic franchise, I'm not gonna blast this series out of my sights just because Disney owns and distributes it. I'm also not letting the EU's loss get in the way of my thoughts on the new series. I'd also like to make it clear that Lucasfilm Animation has done the work, not Disney as so many silly fans have come to believe.",2014
1,"Star Wars: Rebels. Oh sweet Sith Lords, this show is awful. In my honest opinion, you have to be seven to find this in the least bit entertaining. And before you hate me, I know that's the point. Star Wars: Rebels is a hit and miss for a galaxy far, far away. Disney tried, I'll give them that. But the plot is horrid, the animation is sub-par, the characters aren't interesting. Star Wars: Rebels pales in comparison to the show I grew up with - Star Wars: The Clone Wars. I don't find it the least bit entertaining. A couple episodes, I will hand it to them, had moments that made me smile. Such as Dee Bradley Baker briefly voicing Ezra's father. But other than those few moments, my loathing for this series has not as of yet wavered. ",2015
1,"boring, unexciting, the music was good in the originals because it was made to fit. this was added just to con us this like the original when clearly it is not, the story is interesting and has already been written better, the animation is a joke, seems like backyarigans. with such a great franchise to work with they went and dumbed it down to please those flash in the pants fans that will be gone as soon as they get bored, those of us that loved this franchise for 30 years and are the people who made this successful in the first place are once again left with nothing.",2014
1,"Dave Filoni at it again. I didn't like his Clone Wars cartoon either, but just when you think it can't get worse than that, you get Rebels. What is it with them attempting to shove McQuaries artwork down our throats and make it feel like the Original Trilogy? Even Lucas and his directors then didn't use the art...they used it as a template and made their own designs. Just like in the CLone wars they had PERFECT material to draw from for a GREAT story within the Dark Horse comics and then the Dark Times story arc for Rebels. The art/animation was subpar, if they wanted to even stand a chance they should've allowed Pixar to work on that. The plot and story was predictable straight from the Original movies and the Empire was made to look like baffoons. I mean an ISB agent looked like a standard Stormtrooper. What is with Disney and Hollywood for that matter trying to reboot everything? No one in the entertainment industry has any original ideas and Disney and LFL just want to play off the original movies. HOw long before Disney reboots A New Hope to cram all that Ralph artwork into it? And this is just Aladdin in SPace. Yeah...my vote stands. 1 Star.",2014
2,"In their quest to overwrite all that came before and make this an acceptable substitute for the prematurely ended The Clone Wars, they have tried WAY too hard to make it like the original Star Wars trilogy. The end result: its anything but original. Part of being THE original was just that: it was new.",2014
10,"The first episode, Spark of Rebellion was absolutely fantastic! The episode itself, doesn't go into detail with some of the characters, but that's okay considering this is the first episode. The only problem I have with this really is the wookies, they look like the old action figures. But that being said this is a great first episode, much better than the clone wars and instead of using old characters they're using new ones, which is fantastic. I do see this show evolving on the way that the Clone Wars did. Also Obi-wan had a cameo, which was brilliant and Clone wars fans will lose their pants over it. The overall story is quite interesting, the rebels have to try and free a bunch of wookie slaves, however before hand they run into Ezra who screws everything up for them. So this episode was brilliant and I hope we see more brilliant stories and go more in depth with character back stories. Star Wars: Rebels receives a 9/10!",2014
1,"It's Star Wars reduced to the lowest common denominator e.g. inappropriate use of OT musical cues, imperials with clipped British accents, a ship that kind of looks like the Millennium Falcon, villains that kind of look like a combination of Vader and Maul, hero's that are a bit like Obi-Wan, Han Solo, Anakin and Chewie etc. There's little, at present, that expands the scope of what was previously seen in The Clone Wars cartoons. It's all very meta and does little to expand Star Wars through animation (certainly not in terms of what The Clone Wars cartoons achieved). Disappointing, but with the potential for improvement (if they can be bothered to think beyond what should constitute 'cool').",2014
9,I enjoyed it. I thought it was fun and something different.,2014
8,"This is never a great reason to post a review, but there are about 4 reviews on this page that are insane fanboy drivel and I feel a need to balance them out. ",2014
9,At first I was very skeptical of the new Star Wars canon after removing the old EU from canon. The pilot was not as good as hyped but still was very close. After that it only seemed to get better. The show seems to flow seamlessly from episode to episode. I know that I can not speak for the rest of the series but at least in the first several episodes there are great character development and interaction. This show feels like Star Wars and give me the feeling I had when I first saw Star Wars for the first time. I think that Lucasfilm made a good move in creating new characters that we have not had exposure to yet and makes for a better show. If Episode VII is as good as this show it will be great but hoping for better. After seeing the first three episodes I believe that Star Wars is headed for a bright and better future thanks to this show as the kick off.,2014
6,"Overall it is an OK show, I will give you that. But it is far behind what the Clone Wars had as entertainment. Every episode has a distant story line that simply does not converge with the Imperial Era, and what we have in movies 4, 5 and 6. ",2017
10,"I was skeptical at first and to tell you the truth the hardest thing to get past is Ezra's (the main character) nose? He is supposed to be human right. Anyway the annoying design choice aside I LOVED IT! The colors, the landscape and design rocked it. The characters are lovable and flawed. If you watch it with firefly in mind the personalities translate almost as much as star wars. Disney did way better then the clone wars TV show and you could tell that the attention to detail in respect to the original trilogy while still holding onto its own. That is a tall order and they handle the balance perfectly. After only seeing one episode there were moments that I was impressed with in the episode. Things that I thought was just plain brilliantly done. Hey if Mel was a Jedi I would watch it, wouldn't you?",2014
1,This is a disappointing take on the Star Wars universe. Disney need to understand that Star Wars is meant to be tailored to all ages of sci-fi fans not just 3 year old's! The clone wars series was 1000 times better than this will ever be! Hopefully Disney will read some of the reviews on these sites and get their act together! The negative reviews outweigh the positive and I couldn't agree more with the negative ones!! Maby if they got all of the old Lucas team on board or consult with them prior to releasing this rubbish then this appalling take could have been avoided. I only hope that JJ can salvage and save Star Wars before it is too late with the new trilogy. If I could give this a zero rating then I would.,2014
10,"Although I'm tempted to write pages, I'm going to make this short and sweet. Star Wars Rebels replaces the last three Star War films as the continuation of the original vitality and brilliance that brought us New Hope, Empire, and Jedi. If young Anikin were of the age, personality, and vigor of Ezra (the primary character of Rebels) Phantom Menace and the other Star Wars prequel movies might have had a chance. Rebels is scripted wonderfully, the animation is lively and beautifully lighted, the music is gorgeous, and the characters are just about perfect. The whole show is all the more a delight because it was a surprise to me. I expected another silly, weak product with the Star Wars name slapped on it. But this show is just the opposite. It is an excellent addition to the Star Wars legacy. Anyone that truly loves Star Wars will tremendously enjoy Star Wars Rebels.",2015
2,"I've seen two episodes of ""Star Wars Rebels"". This is a Disney production, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the shows are childish in nature. Unfortunately, there is nothing remarkable at all about this new series. It is essentially a repackaging of now-cliché'd Star Wars action sequences and musical scores. What remains are a bunch of uninteresting characters and juvenile dialogue.",2014
1,"I had high expectations for this TV show. I was never a huge fan of the Clone Wars series but I have to admit there were some good arcs. I was expecting the same here but unfortunately the focus is different. Disney aims for toddlers in this TV show and this is pretty much what dictates the pace here. The show is repetitive, predictable and dumb. Every episode starts and ends with a very predictable result. There is no bigger plot in the show. Stormtroopers are dumb to the point they wont even lock their cockpits and wont hit an elephant one foot away from them. In the last episodes of season one they tried to cater to adults more like having some cameos from some characters of the original trilogy even with the original actors but what a waste, what a waste. They even started to play the old tunes we all love like the imperial march but playing the imperial march while at the same time the Empire acts like retarded soldiers just make the attempt despicable and laughable. The Empire march was supposed to bring fear and respect and this is not the message they are sending with the stupid behavior of the Empire characters. This show either needs to change its focus or be cancelled. If you are older than 6 avoid this show at all costs.",2015
1,WHY.... ,2014
9,"About a week ago I wrote a comment that ranked ""Rebels"" as a 3 of 10 after watching all but the last episode on the 1st Season. ",2016
1,"The first season of Rebels was a sign of what's to come. Take elements from SW, put them in a blender with no concept whatsoever, and dump them together with things that have nothing to do with Star Wars. Add shallow and dull characters (even Aladdin himself), boring, pedestrian environments and uninteresting plots, lower the level of visuals considerably, threw out imagination, lore and the established rules of the SW universe, then spice it up with pure nonsense. The recipe for Force Awakens was already developed here.",2016
4,"A couple of years ago, when I heard Peter Jackson would direct two more Middle-earth movies, I started crying out of excitement. Those two movies soon got changed into three and I was angry because I was convinced the story was too short for three three-hours-long movies. Despite the book being approximately 300 pages long, Peter Jackson & co. proved me wrong and managed to not include big parts of the books in these movies, even though there's more than 8,5 hours of total screen time. ""Disappointed"" is an understatement.",2014
1,"I should begin by saying that I am a big fan of Tolkiens work, and have read LOTR and The Hobbit (and his other books) many times. I did enjoy the first trilogy, and thought that the changes Jackson did to the story were sometimes understandable, sometimes acceptable. However, I have no idea what happened with this movie and the whole second trilogy. ",2014
1,"I was as irritated as most people when I heard that Peter Jackson would split The Hobbit into three movies because it was obviously a decision based on nothing more than getting as much money as possible, but even I never imagined that he would stoop to making a movie like Battle of the Five Armies (a.k.a. Battle of the 25 Armies plus a couple of random giant mountain goats and a pig thrown in for good measure).",2014
2,"Peter Jackson, with this new trilogy, which adapts a somewhat long children's fairy tale into a three-part action epic, each movie being three hours long and delving into completely irrelevant stories that are only hinted at in Tolkien's body of work, has really destroyed his reputation as the Tolkien translator. He will always live in the shadow of The Lord of the Rings, which is a sumptuous, beautiful, heartrending, thrilling masterpiece.",2014
5,"What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies, it may - I hope - be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.",2014
2,"I first experienced The Hobbit at the age of 4, when my mother read it to me, and I have been a Tolkien fan ever since. And I have been generally disappointed with Peter Jackson's take on The Hobbit since the beginning. Jackson abused the mythos, struck out trying to turn a lighthearted children's book into a trio of Serious Epics, and created bloated, endless action scenes that did nothing to legitimately advance the plot (before this film, the barrel-battle and the golden dragon-dip were the most egregious). I honestly could not think of a single scene which was not addressed more effectively in the cheap 1970s cartoon. And I found it painfully obvious that Jackson was trying to cheat his way to success by hitting all of the same notes as he did in the Lord of the Rings films, whether or not they made sense in this context (the character Tauriel exists solely to be Arwen; the character Alfrid exists solely to be Wormtongue).",2014
1,As a fan of the books first and the movies second I have willingly celebrated the achievement of Peter Jackson and his team for bringing this wonderful world to the screens.,2014
2,* This Review contains a few spoilers*,2014
5,"In Jackson's defense: the project was ambitious to begin with. Turn 310 pages of children's literature into an epic Hollywood trilogy. Many debates go on about which movie was the best: the fairy tale, the one in-between, or the die hard-alike final. The sad truth is, that to a pure fan, they are, one by one, in their own unique ways, an abomination. ",2014
5,"Well, I have to say that I'm glad that's over. The final movie was well worth the price of admission, which in my case was a free ticket to a preview screening.",2014
1,"I despise Desolation of Smaug, so I can assure you I went in with minuscule expectations. Even those were shattered. I have disregarded the book in this review, because the book was ruined back in Desolation of Smaug. I watched this as a movie, ignoring everything I knew about how it was meant to go. ",2014
1,"How a wonderful book for children became a movie full of noise and void... Poor Bilbo... I felt sad all the time during this last movie, as bad as its predecessor. Unnecessary characters (why Tauriel, why ?!), ridiculous monsters, absurd scenes (Legolas jumping from crumbling stones to crumbling stones), fake sets, loud and empty music, there is nothing to save this movie. Where is the magic of The Lord of the Ring, where the Middle Earth looked so real ? Where is Tolkien's spirit ? Why Peter Jackson could betrayed so much Bilbo ? I sincerely hope that he will do much better in his future projects ; let's forget this trilogy...",2014
1,If you haven't read The Hobbit and/or if you like the first two movies: I envy you of sorts... ,2014
3,"Before seeing _The Battle of the Five Armies_ today, I told people, ""The first two films lacked fidelity to the book, but this one should be better."" I figured Jackson wouldn't have to add lots of extraneous invented action scenes because the final third of the book contained plenty of action.",2014
5,"When I went to the theater, I was filled with hope, excitement and joy. I'm the biggest Hobbit fan I know(I adore the movies, the book, and collect all the trinkets and art books I can.), and since the Desolation of Smaug had been a quite good movie, and I had heard Peter Jackson claim this film was going to be even more serious and thriller-y, I naturally assumed it was going to be a dark, thrilling movie that had me on the edge of my seat.",2014
1,"This is one of the worst movies I ever seen. Yes, the former was a cliché phrase, but it goes very well with a movie full of them.",2015
1,"I love the first 5 movies by Peter Jackson and this completely disappointed me...The battle could have been much more epic but the problem lies with all of the extra plot lines Peter Jackson decided to throw in (that weren't in the book). Because of those, the movie was forced to focus on tying up any loose ends dealing with those added characters and plots. So, the movie didn't do justice to just how important of a battle this was in Middle Earth history.",2014
5,So... That was The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The final film in Peter Jackson's six-film Middle-Earth saga.,2014
3,"I'm like many others a big fan of the LOTR movies, but the Hobbit series started as a cheap wannabe and ended in a disaster.",2014
1,"The third part of the trilogy (?!) is by far the worst ever movie inspired, if inspire is the word to be used in any relation to this movie, by a Talkien book. ",2014
5,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is my favourite movie of all time. But my passion for middle earth doesn't stop there, I am obsessed with this world and in love with the vastness and complexity of its characters and stories. So, did I like the movie? Yes, a lot. Was the movie actually good? That would be more debatable. Before I go into the thick of this review, I just want to remind that I really like the movie, but if it seems that I am highlighting only the negative points it is because they are so frustrating.",2014
1,"This ""movie"" is definitely worthy of being thrown into the fire! My in-laws gave us the tickets (to be fair - we would have been so stupid and payed for it ourselves... so... there you go: We FINANCED further abominations like this!) Whatever happened to good, decent filmmaking? This was a terrible, over-the-top, soulless WAR MOVIE!!! It feels as numb and un-emotional as a general anesthetic. There were main-characters dying? Oh, true... well, who cares? Remember anyone the death scene of Sean Bean in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (yes, he always dies - but he died really well in that one) Oh, or who the F cares about some CGI-Mega-Orc fighting a dwarf on ice Flash Gordon Style? And also: Did he touch the ground of that frozen lake before he jumped back to ruin some more or less decent CGI-Death-Scene? - or did he do the Legolas ""I don't care about gravity"" thing? Questions above questions - yet now answers! I'd like to ask Peter Jackson what the hell happened! Was he forced with a gun to his head to make this? Or did he just direct it from a smart-phone, while sitting on his couch at home and counting his money? Yes, I'm aware that the TRUE EVIL, the true Morgoths are the Studios and the endlessly greedy film industry! If young people like Playstation graphics and action, shaky-cam and *beep* 3D - let them have it! Who cares about nice cinematography when the highest grossing movie are made in absurd-looking 3D and with completely over-the-top everything! In the last 14 years since the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING came out, I was telling my nerdy friends (and everybody else) how amazing the Lord of the Rings movies are, how muche love and effort went into them.",2015

1,"In this film you will see: Animated fights containing dwarfs. Animated fights containing elves. Animating fights containing humans. Animated fights containing orcs. Superlarge animated worms which digs through unnoticeable through the ground. Characters you don't care about dieing. Plot devices everywhere. Eagles saving the day... once more... for no reason. Animated animations doing animated things. Legolas breaking even more laws of physics (seriously, that dude must be a god or something.. He jumps like... 30 meter, onto a giant troll which is about 7 meters tall, sticks a knife in his brain, mindcontrols him to knock down a tower which later on becomes a bridge which he will fight another giant orc which will almost die like 123 times and then at the end die once and for all.... lol jk he survived but noes, now he did die and lol we're happy ohno he survived anyway OK now legolas killed him). A love story which feels awfully forced and pointless (srsly... who cares???). Countless forced references to lord of the rings (also sersly... we get it... the hobbit is a prequel, okay, let it go.).",2014
1,These three movies have almost no relationship to the book.,2014
1,"I am no Leftie, no Hippie, no Anti-American. I love America and I love war movies. No hidden agenda, this is simply a very bad movie that left me wonder if the authors think that we are slightly thick, so they had to keep things REALLY simple. The whole movie is Bradley Cooper (I was a fan until now) shooting at baddies from a roof. Why? Whom is he exactly shooting at (more specifically than just 'at savages' please)? This is going back to the era of bad Western movies, where the Indians were portrayed as the bad guys and the Cowboys were the good guys, just like a kids' play-pretend. I hate to tell you, the world is way more sophisticated than that. Don't we all agree by now that soldiers on either side of the war are incredibly similar, risking their lives to follow an ideology, right or wrong may that be? America should be offended to be portrayed in such a simplistic way",2015
1,When American Sniper first came out I ignored the film thinking that it was the usual war propaganda Hollywood delivers once a year. ,2015
1,"First, let me say that Eastwood's direction, Cooper's acting and the screenplay are all competent. Were this film a wholly fictional account of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it would be quite serviceable, though no more than that.",2015
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,2015
1,Make no mistake. This film is not about recording history. It's about making money.,2015
1,"Let me start by saying that ""American Sniper"" has portrayed the true face of Americas great brainwashing weapon called ""Hollywood"".",2015
1,"""American Sniper"" is one of the worst movies I have ever been forced to endure. It is simplistic propaganda masquerading as an award-worthy story. There is no story.",2015
1,"I want to say this movie made me very angry. I'm trying to explain now why. It begins already with the first scene. A young Iraqi woman with a little child are walking upon a big enormous American tank. Behind the tank there are lots of American soldiers. The city around the woman and the child is completely destroyed. The woman and the child are standing pretty far away from the tank. The woman holds something looking like a WWII grenade, she gives the boy the grenade in the middle of the street (so everybody can see it), the boy is running towards the tank. Then Sniper Kyle kills him. Then the woman shocked about the ""unexpected"" death of her child picks up the grenade and tries to throw the grenade angrily at the tank. Kyle the big hero kills her too and saves the big American tank from this dangerous WWII hand-grenade. I don't know if Kyle described this scene in his book, but if yes I don't believe him. It just doesn't make any sense. First the boy couldn't have thrown the grenade anywhere near this tank. He was too small and to weak. If he was up to destroy the tank or kill the soldiers near the tank he would have walked to them and the grenade should have exploded then. But who activated the grenade and do grenades have a 3 minutes timer nowadays? Why was this woman standing around in the middle of the street after she gave the boy the grenade? Did she want to watch how the boy dies and get killed too? Wouldn't it be smarter to wait until the tank passes them and then throw the grenade? Iraqi's are human if you didn't knew and they have brain. The whole scene just seemed entirely made up only to justify the killing. Look at the cover of the movie, a big American flag and Chris Kyle the sniper behind this flag. But does anybody know why the Americans invaded Iraq? Was it, because this country was responsible for 9/11? As far as I know an organization called Al-Qaida was responsible. And their leader was operating from Afghanistan and in the end found in Pakistan. This war was entirely unjustified from my point of view. Unjustified sounds too soft, from my point of view it was a crime. But the movie gets worse. Kyle was taught by his father there are only three types of people in this world: sheep, wolves and sheepdogs and while the father was talking we can see a Bible on the table. But as far as I remember I haven't read anything about sheepdogs in the Bible. Maybe his father couldn't live with the fact of being a wolf so he made up sheepdogs to feel better. WTF!!!! The movie had a 131 min running time, but it felt like the movie was not running, the movie was creeping. Instead of Action we can see breastfeeding and burials. After Kyle died they have put 150 eagles on his coffin for every kill he made. I almost had to throw up at this scene. The whole movie reminded me of this movie shown in Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" called ""Nation's Pride"", where Hitler applauded and told Goebbels it was the best movie he had seen. Now the USA applauds to this movie by giving the movie even an Oscar nomination. What an irony. Unbelievable. Clint Eastwood I think you kind of lost it, man. Bradley Cooper I liked you in a lot of movies, but I hated you in this one.",2016
8,I am so glad I got the opportunity to see this film early. Clint Eastwood has made yet another fantastic film but this time making his mark on the war film genre and he did it well. The story follows Chris Kyle a navy seal sniper claimed to be the deadliest sniper in military history with a record of over 160 confirmed kills. There is a lot to like in this war drama and now I will elaborate.,2015
9,My Thoughts:,2015
9,I have never done a film review before but after seeing American Sniper I thought i would share my views on what a brilliant film this is.,2015
9,"When it comes to true story films, there are times where film-makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. In this case, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper has already contracted not only positive acclaim but a stir of negativity and controversy that surrounds the way Kyle was really like in life. Some say he had lost his mind in the war for peace while others say he was caught up in the emotional aftermath after service but Eastwood has stated that his film is ""the biggest anti-war statement any film can make,"" and said that ""the fact of what war does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did""",2015
9,"The movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the US Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments, containing violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who is in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing film. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first book. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the components, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film enthusiast, this is a movie for you. To those who call Chris Kyle a murderer and baby killer, I believe you fail to understand what soldiers sacrifice to protect our liberties and keep us free.",2015
10,"I can't remember a movie in the last decade, that was as riveting and captivating as ""American Sniper."" I kept seeing the trailer on TV and when I finally went to see it, I was already jacked-up...and it delivered.",2015
8,"Good work on Bradley Cooper's part as well, putting on the weight and getting into character to play Chris Kyle, a sniper for the navy seals who did four tours in Iraq protecting his fellow troops by being a legendary shot. the Movie explores Kyle having to deal with a rival sniper who was keeping him from doing the job of protecting his troops and having to deal with coming home to his wife and kids feeling that his mission was incomplete. ",2014
9,"I spent 27 years in the US Army, was in Operation Desert Storm (the original), was vehemently opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thought this movie was one of the best military/war movies I've ever seen. The realism was there, Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, the angst of a soldier during battle was portrayed brilliantly, the decisions we ask kids to make are real and they were realistically shown on screen, and as this film makes clear--war isn't a walk in the park. Anybody who thinks Bradley Cooper is a flash in the pan is sadly mistaken; this guy is the real thing. Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, Charlie Sheen in Platoon, and now Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. You've got to go all the way back to Gregory Peck in Pork Chop Hill or George C. Scott in Patton to get even close to an actor that gave a better performance in this genre. I saw it twice. Couldn't get through it the first time and had to walk out- -I got so damned furious at George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld for murdering all these innocent kids I couldn't watch anymore. Once I got past that I went back to see it again and trust me--it's phenomenal.",2015
9,American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character. There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.,2015
9,"American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's harrowing take on Chris Kyle's life and his service in the Navy as a SEAL sniper who killed nearly 200 enemy soldiers. The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but honors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It doesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere man with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice for his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his career as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he became this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note. Clint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even in his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American Sniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic war film clichès, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book and while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story regarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film like The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching scenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of this film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's deteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a film like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with great cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to Eastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound and hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great cinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that will tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and even goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment with grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year.",2014

10,"We saw an Advanced Screening of American Sniper last week, and it was awesome. This movie was directed by Clint Eastwood and you can see his hand in it. It's not flashy, and it tells the story without adding to it like Hollywood tends to do with all war movies, especially ones about the recent wars our men have served in. You feel like you know at least a portion of what a sniper and his Seal team went through while serving in the Iraq War. But, most importantly, it also tells the story of an Extraordinary Man, a true American Hero, who devoted much of his life to his country, taking multiple tours to keep ""his men"" safe, and to protect his country. What an extraordinary movie. I can't say enough about it. Everyone should see this movie. See what this man did for our country. I would also recommend staying through the credits. All the film shown during the ending credits is from actual newsreels. An excellent movie. I wholly recommend it.",2015
5,"After 9/ 11 Man decides to help America fight terrorism and joins the navy seals as a sniper. He goes on four tours of Iraq during the war but when he returns to normal civilian life he struggles. Another film that won Oscars but that means little to me, the main and essential question that I always ask is "" Is this film i'm watching entertaining and does it involve me and keep me watching""? The answer to both of those questions is ""No"". Film for the most part is boring and it has little emotion, Bradley Cooper is miscast. Another very average movie directed by Clint Eastwood whose films get less interesting as he gets older. No more than a average film.",2016
9,"Few times does a movie remain entertainment yet tell a deep truth, American Sniper manages just that. If one wanted a recent definition of a American Patriot hero it's effectively brought to life by the masterful direction of Clint Eastwood. This movie will be his crowning achievement in a much celebrated career. Such a feat could not be accomplished with just any story however. The life of Chris Kyle, and what he stood for, makes a perfect synergy.",2015
9,"I did not expect such a talented cast of actors mostly in small parts. Jon Favearu has a lot of friends. The actor who played his son is a find. He was great. Low key, sweet and very natural and believable. The story is good. It is about the chef and then the food truck, but it really is about him and his son. I liked that he was friends with his ex wife, Sofia Vergara, who did a great job. That struck home for me, because my ex and I get along well and it brought a lump to my throat to see how happy that made their son. It is special when divorced parents can get along and do things with their kids. The story moved quickly and I loved how the son used twitter and they incorporated social media into the story. Very realistic. I highly recommend this movie. Really a joy to watch.",2014
8,"I really enjoyed this funny and heart-warming movie about a chef and his relationship with food and his son. The film is worth about 8.5 in my books. The current IMDb score is roughly accurate, despite the inexplicably negative reviews and voting of a tiny minority.",2014
7,"I'm no foodie but I really enjoyed this road-trip / father-son / buddy movie, written directed by and starring Jon Favreau, based on the recent life and times of a perfectionist chef who struggles to suppress his own innovation to the demands of his conservative paymaster boss. More than this, he gets involved in a spat with the town's number 1 food critic, sees his relationship with his son founder under pressure of work and still pines after his glamorous and super-rich ex-wife.",2015
8,"At an early point in Chef, the title character cooks a grilled cheese sandwich for his 10-year-old son, Percy. It's a familiar recipe —bread, butter, and cheese — but the way that the camera lingers on the melting cheese, and the care taken in how the food was served, made me want to reach into the screen and take a bite. If Chef were a meal, it would be comfort food. When comfort food is done right, boy oh boy does it hit the spot. ",2014
9,Jon Favreau is Chef Carl Casper working in a restaurant for a boss he doesn't see eye to eye with. He ends up leaving his job after he becomes fed up with the menu and receiving some bad criticism from a food critic. He exchanges insults with the food critic via Twitter and of course it goes viral and Carl's reputation is really on the line. He's also having some problems with his own personal life after he and his wife split and he is trying to build a relationship with his young son. The story follows Carl as he looks to get his career back on track and build stronger bonds with his loved ones.,2015
8,"I can't help feeling that this movie is not only about a chef finding himself, but it's also about lead actor/director Jon Favreau trying to get back in touch with the kind of films he used to make -- small ones without guys wearing super-suits or cowboys drawing down on aliens. Here, Favreau's Carl Casper quits his big Iron Restaurant job and rediscovers himself, and his passion for food and family, by running a Chef-sized food truck. Results: excellent.",2014
8,"As I've been exposing myself to new types of movies and different filmmakers, I sometimes feel like I'm trying new food. CHEF, directed by and starring Jon Favreau, was a delightful little indie ""dish"" and an immensely satisfying treat. It's about a chef, Carl Casper (Favreau), who works for this French restaurant. One night a critic (Oliver Platt) comes in and later posts a scathing review on Twitter that goes viral. Carl, a little bit new to social media, inadvertently starts a flame war with the critic and challenges him to come back because he'll cook the menu he wanted to cook the first time around. Things don't end up going so well, and Carl leaves his job as chef and takes his ex-wife's (Sofia Vergara) advice about starting a food truck. Narratively, the film is somewhat divided. The first third or so is more of a traditional ""food"" movie with some relationship drama thrown in, but at a critical point the film shifts gears into a road trip movie. Structure aside, I thought that they did a great job balancing the food aspects (which looked amazing) and the character relationships. The key relationship is between Carl and his son, who comes along with him on his food truck journey. It was really great to see how the relationship changed and improved over the course of the film. Something should also be said for the cast. Although most of them have relatively small roles, Favreau was able to call in some favors and get Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale, John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara to appear here. Even though most of these people only appear in the first half when Carl works at the restaurant (and are therefore dropped once the narrative switches gear), it was still nice to see them. I thought they all gave excellent performances, even for such small roles. The only iffy member of the cast was the boy who plays Carl's son who, at times, seemed like a blank slate. Maybe that was intentional? I don't know, but he also is a child actor so I won't make too big a deal out of it. The only other aspect of the movie I find fault with is the way in which the film ends, which I won't spoil here. All I'll say about it is that it was a little TOO nice and clean. That being said, I thought that CHEF really worked on an emotional level. Overall, it might not be the best film I've ever seen, but it had a feelgood atmosphere, great dialogue and some great cooking. Bon appetit!",2015
8,"Stepping away from the blockbusters that have occupied his time and talents of late, Jon Favreau scales back the spectacle to deliver Chef, a thoroughly enjoyable story of redemption set amid the chaos and camaraderie of the kitchen in which Favreau delivers what may be his best performance yet. In addition to taking on the lead role of disgruntled chef Carl Casper, Favreau also wrote the screenplay and served as producer and director, putting himself firmly in the firing line if the film misfired. Fortunately, he has got most of it right and Chef overcomes any shortcomings through its refreshing take on relationships - particularly between Carl and his 10-year-old son Percy (Emjay Anthony) - and the power of technology and social media as both a destructive force and an instrument of considerable social currency. Confined to bit parts of late in the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street and the three Iron Man films, Favreau seems to relish the opportunity to take on this role of a man forced to re-evaluate everything that is important to him.",2014
8,"CHEF is a total delight! I was expecting a forced attempt by Hollywood veterans to make a ""charming"" and ""heartfelt"" indie. Instead, I discovered a truly genuine film that is both charming and heartfelt for real with no unnecessary plot points (OK, the end is a bit rushed and tagged on). This is the best film since SINGIN IN THE RAIN to depict the pleasure and fun of hard work, friendship, and camaraderie. CHEF has a great spirit that is never forced and every performance is truly perfect. Just spot on in every way. Favreau really shows what a great director of actors he is in the direction of Emjay Anthony. This is a real kid, not a movie kid.",2014
3,"I wanted to enjoy this film and have it live up to its hype, but I couldn't. I thought I might be watching a homage to food like ""Sideways"" was to wine, but the last minute was written like like Favreau was running out of ink or paper for his script. It starts out fine, but after the Chef is fired/quits/takes the night off after the bad review, he goes home and preps all this great food. I thought he intended to invite the critic to eat this food, but instead he goes back to the restaurant without the food and screeches at him at the top of his lungs. Wha? Then, I get the buddy/father/son road trip across country in the food truck. I'm thinking ""Sideways""...then they get to LA and the last minutes of the movie derail this movie completely: the critic loves the food truck food a little too much & offers Chef a job at his restaurant. Wait a second: the owner of the first restaurant promised Chef total food control too & later changed their deal so Chef would cook only what the owner wanted. So, I thought the food truck was about having sole control again. Nope: chef decides to accept the deal and enter into another deal working for somebody else, just like how he started at the first restaurant. That makes no sense. The food truck vanishes in an instant to be replaced by the restaurant and we see the chef married to his ex-wife for only the sole reason that she inadvertently blurted out she loved her ex a couple minutes earlier in the film. Wait, what? This could have been a 10 movie, if only Favreau had focused on what the premise of the movie was supposed to be: a chef in love with cooking standing on his own two feet and succeeding. Instead, I'm left with the impression that this movie was more a statement about the good/evil of using social media (mainly Twitter). Maybe the movie should have been called ""Cyberbully""?",2014
4,"Wow! I struggled to give it a 4. It could have easily been titled Two and a Half Men and a Truck. I thought the writing was weak, the acting was average, and the ending was bad. Of course, I couldn't wait for the ending.",2014
2,"I had seen and heard the hype so I admit that my expectations were, perhaps unfairly, high. But even without such expectations this film is worse than bad. With such an illustrious cast, I starting watching the film and kept waiting for a moment of redemption, which never came. ",2014
2,"I will not get into the particulars of why this is bad- all of the other reviewers have pointed them out (i.e. thin script, mediocre acting...etc...) all true. ",2014
1,"I just watch this movie yesterday and.. I supposed it's funny movie, and it was really! but not about the story! I laugh on how silly this movie is and myself that I waste time watch it.. ",2014
3,"In keeping with our ongoing food in media culture (top chef, iron chef, survivor new guinea (cannibal chef)) we now have simply ""Chef"" the feel good ""indie"" movie of the year. Indie as in some really rich guys got together with some really famous, and quirky!, actors to make a movie. Don't believe for a minute that product placement (tweet) would have any place in an ""indie"" movie, or in independent internet reviews either. (Twitter me at #sethlovestwitter). Tweet, Tweet.",2014
1,"I saw this film in the summer of 2014 at the peak of its hype, expectations weren't considerably high going in, but I never anticipated to have two hours of my life wasted by a fat, arrogant, vain, power hungry, woeful director. Who is so desperate to enhance his public image that he disregards most of the desired qualities of a 'good film' such as plot, acting, character development, and screenplay. I would love to go through the plot in detail, but the following summary covers the A-Z of the storyline. We follow the trials and tribulations of a considerably weighty individual who at the start appears to have the perfect life (somehow), owning a massive mansion, a doting model wife (who wouldn't bat an eye lid to his grotesque and ample physique in any dimension) as well as servants, and a top job at a successful restaurant where he is adored by his staff, including an incredibly unlikely love interest of that of another model like character played by Scarlett Johansson. Not surprisingly, Chef Favreau throws a temper tantrum at his restaurant when a critic complains about the food... What would seem to be a small blip in his idyllic life. However this is not the case, THE CHEF then decides to leave his highly paid job on a whim (clearly his model wife bringing in a hefty income on the side) to start a whimsical cross-country adventure in a food truck with his son and half of the staff who abandoned their job security to pander to his bulging ego and damaging mid-life crisis. Again somehow due to the help of his son's social media skills he becomes immensely popular for his ""famous"" Cuban sandwiches. The only presence of any form of conflict in this disaster strewn picture comes with the tiff he endured with his spoilt little son over cleaning a cooker. After this heart-wrenching moment the strong father-son relationship is resumed immediately. Upon returning from his wild trek across country all his problems are resolved as quick as he cultivated them when the same critic pops up as a wealthy benefactor offering CHEF JOOOHN the opportunity of a lifetime, which he duly accepts on the condition he can continue to travel away from his newly entitled responsibilities (seems to be a recurring theme in his life) to continue high tailing across America as a internet born demi-god. All in all a travesty in filmmaking and a stain on the reputation of most esteemed critic sites (not to mention Rotten Tomatoes) and one that pops to mind is IMDb. I am extremely disappointed in the users of this website for giving it a rating of over 2. Don't BOTHER",2016
1,"This would qualify as a terrible made-for-TV movie for the Food Network, let alone Lifetime. The folks that wrote 2011's ""Real Steel"" would have sued Favreau for plagiarism - but they did not want their movie even remotely associated with this heap of overcooked clichés...",2015
3,"First part: A fat tattooed man who works as Head chef in some restaurant in LA has a verbal battle via twitter with the most acclaimed food critic in the city. The whole thing degenerates so fast that within 24 hours, the chef finds himself out of work. This is a brief overview of what you get in the first 50 minutes of the movie. During these 50 minutes, i thought I was watching a TV movie (if it wasn't because Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey JR and Dustin Hoffman make a guest appearance). Honestly, nothing to see up until this point. ",2014
3,"The real chef behind Chef was outstanding, producing food that was amazingly scrumptious to look at. Too bad the script didn't match it! The movie began quite well, but soon ran off a cliff when Casper went on his rant. Until then, I felt compassion for him, but completely lost it at that point. No longer could I see myself in his position, because he behaved like no rational person would. Every plot point from then on seemed unnatural, purely manipulative and largely predictable. Faced with insurmountable adversity at the restaurant, a rational person might have invited the food critic to dine in his home or sought a job elsewhere, instead of burning all his bridges.",2015
1,"I was very disappointed with this awful film. It is hard to believe that it was ever made. I went because the reviews seemed to say it was funny. I don't know if they had a deal with Twitter and it was a 100 minute advertisement, but that is what it seemed like. The Chef has an ex wife and kid who live in a mansion. He looks after the kid in his best capacity as a busy chef who gets a bad review from a restaurant critic and quits.",2014
3,the only explanation i can think of for this trite mishmash of lifeless clichés is that somehow it's a brilliant parody that went right over my head. ,2014
8,One of the best movies presented at SXSW this year. Hands down. Favreau's character converges a spotlight on the faceless critics who take themselves too seriously and tear down others in pursuit of their own notoriety; an epidemic in this digital day in age as harsh ideals are spammed across the internet with little recourse.,2014
5,"In my opinion, Chef is the feel-good movie of the year. And this is not because of the plot or the acting. The former is predictable while the latter is alright with a lot funny moments.",2014
8,"I was very apprehensive about checking out the From Dusk Till Dawn the Series, because I really liked the original film and felt that the show wouldn't do justice. This is also because they attempted to do several other films afterwards that were all flops. The difference though between the last couple films and this series, is that Robert Rodriguez(the guy who created/directed original film) is the helmer of this series rather than someone else. The show has proved to be successful with his adapting the film to television. 5 episodes in the series and each one has been nostalgic of the film. What I like about the show is that it follows the original story religiously, but goes into way more detail than it did in the film. I assume things will be somewhat different though from the film before the season is over in order to keep the story going since the series was recently renewed for another season after this one. So far though, the story is building the same way it did in the film, in that the Gecko brothers are on the run after robbing a bank, join up with the Fuller Family by taking them hostage in there RV so that they can evade police and make there way for El Rey. Episode 5 was the best episode I've seen yet. A small synopsis is that The Gecko Brothers and Fuller Family are almost into Mexico, but they need to get past the border checkpoint. This scene is much different than the film though, it that the stakes feel way more dangerous and higher. The story is great and smart, incorporating Wilmer Valderammas character Carlos and Ranger Gonzales who is still hot on the Gecko Brothers trail. All I have to say is by the end of the episode, you'll be wanting to see next weeks. If you've been keeping up with each episode so far, you've noticed little nods to the world of Rodriguez/Tarantino such as The Big Kahuna Burger, Earl Mcgraw's character played by Don Johnson in the series, Seth/Richies mannerisms..etc. If you get the El Rey channel, Netflix, or have internet to download, I definitely recommend keeping up with the series. It is surprisingly an entertaining show to watch on Sunday's.",2014
9,"So if you seen the movie From Dusk Til Dawn, then yes you know most of whats going to happen. The first episode is pretty much just an expanded retelling of the gas station opening from the movie. It adds some new content and modern things such as cell phones. The acting is pretty good and the casting did a good job of recreating the characters. Some people might complain that it is to much like the original movie, but myself I didn't have a problem with it. To me it was like watching a British show like Shameless and then watching the American version. Same thing different actors but still a great story. I enjoy seeing how different actors portray a character. They really do expand on a lot of things that the movie didn't go into. If your a hardcore elitist you might not like it but if you never seen the movie or are open minded about a franchise being rewritten, then this show is top notch.",2014
8,"a little early to write a review so i will probably write another one when the show is over. anyways i have watched episodes 1 through 4 and i really like the way this series is being handled. the director of the original steps in and says ""hey there is so much more to be done with these characters"" so the series is a remake of the original film with good performances from the cast and a much more in-depth look at the events of the original. the grindhouse feel of the original isn't really present so much this time around but the story is still interesting. especially the way the mayan vampire angle is being fleshed out much more. only 3 episodes in and i can already tell it's looking great. one thing i must say about the acting is that the role of the gecko brothers its not played as good as clooney and Tarantino's acting in the original. but still those roles are played well. just not as well. as of right now the verdict is: 8/10.",2014
7,"The first season is a very extensive and amazing version of the movie. Of course there are parts added, but it is fully in the spirit of the movie, and very well written. The second season was a continuation of the first season, as if it was one ongoing story. However, about season III: wow. I think it's somewhat like the Godfather (comparison ends as is): part I is an epic tale, part II is rather good too, but season III is just the worst. What the f*** happened?! This is nothing like the first two seasons: the acting is (very!) cheap, the story is fully not connecting to the previous story, it's just... too simple. As if the budget was cut by 90%. This is like a new series trying to lift by on the success of the first two seasons. I just can't find the right words for how terrible this is... Like Scrubs: if you liked the first seasons, as I did very much, do not watch the last (/latest) season!!",2016
8,Spoilers in the most mild way ,2014
9,"FROM DUSK TILL DAWN THE SERIES should be hailed as an example of how to make a series based on a movie. ROBERT RODRIGUEZ stays true to the characters, and true to the fans of the movie. The expansion of the story is believable and fresh. while you maybe familiar with the story, you anticipate the new. Zane Holtz's ""Ritchie""is exciting and Wilmer Valderrama's ""Carlos"" is witty and fresh, as is the rest of this great cast. Robert Patrick is perfect as Mr. Fuller and the sub plot that put's them on the road to Mexico is yet another story that is slowly unfolding in conjunction with the Geckos, the Rangers, and the border bound souls that line the road to ElRey. You can't go to the twister on an empty stomach, so Rodriguez has opened a BIG KAHUNA BURGER along the way. Bravo.",2014
8,Is this the best supernatural/horror show ever done? No. Is it mildly ridiculous for a director to remake his own (admittedly awesome) movie into a t.v show? Sorta.,2015
8,"So 18 years later, and we have a return to the world of the original From Dusk Till Dawn told from the start right where we first meet the Gecko brothers, *with Kahuna burgers, and thick shakes for everyone* only there are little subtle changes that begin right out in order that they can present the story from new angles, and to allow the introduction of the new Texas Ranger who is introduced in a way that some will feel like he is a Van Helsing like inductee new to the job, and the addition of Wilmer Valderrama﻿ as *Carlos feels like they have sent a demon back through time like the terminator, and he is subtly making changes to the time line to ensure that the Gecko brothers make it to the Winnebago, and then on to Mexico. The Fuller family have finally entered the story with their own new twists like Kate's boyfriend Kyle* I Enjoyed the result of this new show, (Though giving up the shot through the hand was cheap *in the first episode which is made up for in the second*.) and I recommend you check it out if you were ever a fan of the original movie, or even can recall shouting ""look it's Cheech Marin﻿"" as this movie was the Pulp Fiction for the Hollywood Hispanic community, and restarted some infamous careers.",2014
10,"Yes it's a remake of the movie & follows the story quite closely with a few additions. The actors all play the parts well and are all believable. I'm 5 episodes in & loving it, it's fast paced- even though you know what's going to happen (if you have seen the movie) it's still keeping my interest and I can't wait to see the next bit. Even though it follows the story of the movie you could still class it as a stand alone piece. You don't need to have seen the movie to watch the show. interesting, no naked women (yet) for the sake of naked women and it's not overly blood thirsty or violent (not that I'm opposed to those things, just a lot of shows go overboard for the sake of it!) This is my new favorite show. Well written, well acted and well executed. Watch it You won't be disappointed.",2015
1,"Here's the thing, everyone who see's this series already has the movie in mind, and let's face it, you take away the brutality and swearing and you just have a watered down series. Which is exactly their mistake, the actors weren't too bad, the plot is still on track but the actual dialog and the posturing is awful, just terrible. It needs a serious rewrite from some writers that know how to write gritty and the choreography needs to be a lot more natural. Another major problem is that they seem to be rewriting the actual story and how it comes together, I mean some rewrites were expected but not the ones they made, they just make everything seem fake. Right now its a 6/10 because it just doesn't work, not really, tweak and it and then we'll see.",2014
9,"FROM DUSK TILL DAWN THE SERIES should be praised..Robert Rodriguez has delivered Top-notch entertainment with this series and for those tempted to compare it with the original movie:It's based on it. It's not meant to beat it and not based on true events. The elements and atmosphere are there and it goes on for hours. characters are fun and well casted. The Titty Twister is still the place to be and the original theme song ''After Dark'' by Tito & Tarantula has been revamped and tunes you into a new episode. It takes talent and balls for a producer to take this challenge and RR does it right. A sexy freak show,never boring and very well shot. Great Special FX.

4,"So far, this is nothing but the current use of time manipulation to add drama. As I have pointed out in previous reviews, showing what happened and the rehashing it is both being an lazy and unimaginative writer. I automatically dock 5 stars since this has become the common fare of the untalented writers. It is also boring as we have to watch the same events replay twice. It's like watching a movie and a re-run at the same time. There is enough story change from the original that makes it interesting as a series but, if they keep to this format it's not worth your time. I didn't expect the acting to be on par with the movie and it wasn't. This is forgivable if they continue to improve. I'll watch one more to see if it's worth continuing but, I doubt it will be.",2014
10,"Love love love this show, the cast are truly an amazing set of actors and actresses and I was surprised to see how young the characters of Kate and Scott Fuller (Madison Davenport and Brandon Soo Hoo) are, as both are extremely talented. The show is not short of eye candy with Seth and Richard Gecko played by D.J. Cotrona and Zane Holtz and of course the beautiful Santánico Pandemonium played by the very talented and sultry Eiza González. The relationship between all the characters is strong, particularly Seth and Richard Gecko, whose brotherly relationship is very relatable. ",2015
4,"From Dusk till Dawn is one of my favorite movies and when I herd about the T.V show I was worried that it would be A watered down version of the movie and I'm sad to say I was right. George Clooney was the ultimate Badass which was A great departure from ER and Quentin Tarantino can pull of creepy with his eyes shut, Harvey Keitel played the lost pastor with his usual toned down acting that was perfect for the part. It started out as A regular Tarantino style grind house flick that suddenly turned into A crazy vampire movie and left me wondering for A couple of seconds if the projectionist had put the wrong reel on by accident . All of this is what missing in the T.V show...D.J Cotrona is A George Clooney Clone without the attitude and the Dialogue And Zane Holtz is just there he's too pretty and totally unconvincing as Richie. Robert Patrick just seems to be overacting (in A bad way the preacher) and the fun surprise of this turning into A vampire flick is gone because they let us know right from the beginning. I have dragged myself through the first three episodes hoping it will get better...It didn't just put A stake in it and put us out of our misery.",2014
4,"The film is great in itself. It does have it's own little world and tells a story that is not meant to be told in another way. Now with the series I think the studios thought ""Oh, we have a large fan base on this film. How can we exploit that?"". What they created is a mess. How the characters behave is just completely ridiculous and their dialogs are too often just plain dumb. When a group of lizard-vampires is about to attack, every father would say to his son ""Don't let your anger get the best of you. There is a fine line between self-defense and violence."" Not to mention that the guy swings around the stokes like a trained sword fighter, but whatever.",2014

The movie is tight, with suspense, horror and humour both dark and slapstick. Like much of Tarentino's screenplays, it operates at multiple levels, making it great for repeated watching over time. I also thought it might make for a decent limited series, fleshing out some areas of interest and even extending what mythology the film implied.",2014

The show, much like the movie, follows two unhinged brothers as its central characters, running from the law presumably on their way to the ""Titty-Twister"", the Vampiric roadhouse featured in the film. The sympathetic brother of course bears a distinct resemblance to George Clooney, while no effort was made, quite understandably, to make the more psychotic of the pair look anything like Tarentino.

And then it turns out they aren't even vampires, but some kind of weird Aztec snake demon cult. The scripts suck. There's way too much filler, often in the form of flashbacks. The whole ""time manipulation"" gimmick has run its course (Banshee, I'm looking at you). It's lazy writing. There's way too much talking and not enough action, sex, or horror. No idea who would like this drivel. After two episodes, I'm done. Maybe it gets better, but it's taking way too long to get there. Also annoyed it's a remake instead of prequel or sequel or some other thematic continuation with new characters.",2014
8,"A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother's (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven't been this impressed by her as an actress since ""Election"" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in ""Walk the Line""). And it's nice to see Laura Dern again, who's popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie's editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character's hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.",2015
3,"A story of redemption heavy on pain and short on redemption. Reese Witherspoon produces and stars in this story of a woman whose breathtakingly self-destructive behavior--drugs, adultery, degrading sexual encounters, abortion--has brought about a crisis that even she can no longer ignore. Desperate to break the pattern of her life, she decides to set out on a 1000 mile hike of the Pacific Crest trail, despite having little or no experience with backpacking. From her vivid memories of her past misbehavior, we see that she is slowly coming to accept responsibility for her past mistakes, and thereby moving beyond them. ",2015
7,"I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews here. But then I remember, this is IMDb. Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman's story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it ""exciting."" Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or ""training."" Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you've ever been in the area. On foot. I happily gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.",2015
7,"Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.",2015
10,"I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.",2015
9,"This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but not bad at all and worth watching. Well done! This could be called a chick flick for real women who want substance, Strength and encouragement from the female in the role. When the world gets to much and is sucking your life away- Get the heck out and walk, climb a mountain , ride a horse ! Push the boundaries of what you think you are capable of and learn! I cried , it was good. I didn't know anything about it until I watched it. I have been coming to IMDb to pick movies with good ratings and people giving good reviews. Only to be disappointed time and again. If you like the Idea of the film , you will likely enjoy it as much as I did.",2015

8,"Realistic performance of Reese Witherspoon. An history about the life as it is. A movie to watch and review in your mind later. I like drama movies that you suffer as you are watching but give you things to think later, this is this type of movie. Wild is a one-character movie but the little pieces of the secondary characters are so well introduced that allows to introduce drama, fear, suspense and romanticism to the history. If I need to say something wrong about the movie is that in some passages there is lack of continuity and feels as if the movie was longer at the beginning and the director need to cut it to do it shorter.",2015

1,"Fans of Cheryl Strayed likely come away from this movie feeling reasonably content with the outcome. There's no challenge to the end product or hope for anything more. Reese Witherspoon is a pretty personification that many can put their hopes and dreams and selves into and flutter away to the pretty pictures of mountains for a few fleeting moments in their day. For the rest of us, however, the movie is quite unmemorable and intangible. If anything, we simply watch Strayed (Witherspoon) walk around like an entitled, annoyed bitch for two hours, getting into trouble, doing stupid things, hurting anyone close to her, and then crying over spill milk again and again. And all along there's this audacious overtone telling us we should be feeling sorry for Strayed and her struggles give me a break.",2015
3,"For the last couple years hiking on the PCT, I have heard about the book the Wild mainly from non-hikers. I curiously watched this to see what the fuss was about. My experience on the trail was vastly different from the portrayal in the movie. Strayed was very inexperienced and most of the drama stems from that. Also most PCT hikers only really worry about the next water source, getting in their miles, and the next resupply stop.I felt the movie did not really capture the every day life of a PCT hiker very well brushing over common hiker dialog and every day tasks. I will note that backpacking has changed a lot since Strayed hiked. The gear is lighter, we use trail runners instead of hiking boots, trekking poles, and the trail is more popular which is good and bad. The most off putting aspect for someone who has hiked the trail before is the locations and terrain vary greatly from the actual trail. Sometimes I felt that Strayed got lost her entire hike climbing over rocks at Smith Rock in Oregon. Aka the PCT is graded for horses. What was she doing? For someone who would like to watch this movie and recreate great memories, I found it very difficult. The simplest way to explain it is her experience depresses my experience. The real trail is far greater than the movie depicts. The solo hiking women I have met on trail are very strong, independent, and are more than capable of taking care of themselves in the wild. There are people I have met on trail with disabilities and amazing life stories that I think would have made a better movie.",2015
9,"We loved this film...and this is NOT a ""chick flick""...it's for ALL of us and it's about our search for our individual and authentic selves - male or female... so don't miss it! ",2015
9,"Wild is based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed about her lone hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey is meant to be an escape from her personal problems and possibly rehabilitating herself from a troubling past. It expresses these feelings thoroughly; at every turn, there has to be a reminder of what she's been through, but also deals with a potential danger in this hike. The movie lives up to its sentiment, the pain and obstacles that the story goes through feel genuine and it leaves us such a rewarding experience. There are some parts that can feel a little uneven, but its spirit stays intact, enduring what the movie is meant to be.",2015
2,"This could have been a good movie. Unfortunately we were served a vapid predictable one instead. While the scenery was wonderful the plot was lost in the typical sex, drugs, sentimental loss, animal imagery and ego trip we have all come to know and hate. Nick Hornby's focus on the down side of the journey (what came before) left the cathartic experience (what came after) lost. The movie was boring and Witherspoon's mumbled dialog and good looks could not pull us out of the doldrums. The emotional manipulation was so obvious that it was with great relief that finally the film ended. If this is the best the American film industry can produce we should all turn our attention to other countries for emotional depth and real drama.",2014
1,This movie was AWFUL. The only good thing I can say about it is that we bonded watching it because we were all laughing and cursing at how awful the movie was. The flashbacks were horribly done - cutting in and out until you're nauseous with no flow and no benefit to the film itself.,2015
2,"The film had its interesting moments but Witherspoon's horrible character she portrayed and the many flashbacks got in the way and interrupted the movie's flow. I found myself just not caring, liking or sympathizing with Witherspoon's character in the least. I mean, many people have rough, tragic lives but we all don't go off the deep end and become drug-addicted, foul mouthed, adulterous, disrespectful, promiscuous sluts. There is nothing noble or overcoming about this movie. It's a story about an unlikeable, mentally dysfunctional woman trying to resolve her problems by taking a hike. Instead of wasting 2 hours on this dog, I should have taken a hike away from my TV.",2015
2,"Wild fails as a movie for several reasons. A movie based on a book should motivate the movie-goer to turn to the written word for more details. The impression I received from seeing wild is that the book is a self-serving portrayal of a self-destructive personality and some sort of redemption through a self-destructive hike. I suspect that the book uses the personal pronoun singular far too often. If the hike is the path to redemption, when did it occur and why? Damned if I know. We're told at the end that Cheryl ultimately has a happy life and take that on faith because the movie doesn't provide a clue.",2015
2,"Right from the moment I saw the first poster, I was keen and excited and was eagerly looking forward to watching this movie. I am a big fan of adventure movies. Well, to cut the story short, if you are the person who likes Bear Grylls jungle-survival documentaries or if you have loved The Edge or The Rainman or even Alive (movie about some sports team lost in snow-fields when their plane crashes), then THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU. GIVE IT A MISS. It's extremely boring with minute-after-minute flashbacks and at the climax scene, I don't know what she really achieved. I was just waiting for her to finish her walk within 20mins. into the movie, such meaningless it is.",2015
7,"An arduous journey across America on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed tests her tenacity to continue forward till the end. There's very little else to the story, which makes this film really powerful. With not much else other than a tedious walk and a vampish past the story bobs back and forth between the present and the past revealing how Cheryl finds herself in such a circumstance and why she cant stop until she is finished. ",2015
2,"Wild tells the story of Cheryl, a drug fueled binge drinker who lost her mother and feels lost on the path to life so she decides to pick up and walk the Pacific coast trail. Directed by Jean Marc Valèe of last year's Dallas Buyers Club, I was going into this hoping for a brilliant film, instead I came away with great cinematography, an unbelievable Reese Witherspoon and misguided story that wants to be something more than ""a woman and the wilderness"" movie. Well, unfortunately, its not. Valèe seems to have exhausted his talents into last year's Dallas Buyers Club rather than into Wild. My problems with this film exude my likes, obviously but one thing about this film that I can't seem to shake is Witherspoon. I don't buy her as this character, she can't pass as a woman who is a drinker and a drug abuser because quite frankly, she looks terrible on screen doing these things. I don't buy it for a second, it is like watching a student film rehash of a better performance and cringing at how bad the student screws it up. The role of Cheryl was clearly meant for someone with a better range than Witherspoon. I'm all for an actor to transform themselves to fit a film, much like McCounaghey did for Dallas Buyers. But Witherspoon seems so hesitant to do anything other than gain five pounds and not wear make-up for the entire film. No, it doesn't make it look like she has a drug and alcohol problem or is conflicted or is realistic, it just makes for a lazy performance and it is one I couldn't commit to for a two hour film. As far as the screenplay is concerned...well, what screenplay, it is mostly Reese Witherspoon trekking across the Pacific trail while reminiscing about past times and discovering dead end relationships along the way. It is a bare bones script from a bare bones book that was equally disappointing. However, the film may be boring and painfully slow, but the cinematography here was fantastic. There are some truly beautiful moments in this film regarding the way it looks. Outside Witherspoon, the supporting cast features Gabby Hoffman and Laura Dern and both of which deliver good performances. Overall, Wild features some great cinematography and a truly shoddy performance from Witherspoon. I can't begin to explain why she is being praised for taking off make up and walking on a trail for a two hour film. It isn't a brave performance, its a lazy one and an even lazier film. Wild is far from Sean Penn's Into the Wild, which I'm sure will be the base of comparison and feels more like a half baked version of it.",2014

5,"As a woman who has solo hiked many parts of the AT I went to this movie with great hopes of being uplifted and inspired but I left unfulfilled, disappointed and bored. The portrayal of what a long distance hike takes was unrealistic and oversimplified. You do not go out unprepared and you do not just scamper over three boulders or teeter over 4 feet of slippery logs crossing a creek. The trails are fraught with many dangers from man, beast and nature. This made it look like a long hot afternoon walk. Perhaps the real woman's experience was better accounted for in her journals and subsequent book but the movie did nothing to convey her personal struggle to complete a thousand mile trek...",2014
1,"This movie is motherlovin atrocious. Judging by the struggle she was having in the hotel with the backpack, she wouldn't have made it 2 steps after finally getting it on! I couldn't take the movie serious after that. The voice overs and flashbacks are annoying and done in a very cheesy manner. Acting is bad! Nowhere near Oscar! The director was trying so hard to capture a feeling of ""into the wild"" crossed with Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"" but failed miserably. I've never directed a movie before but given even 1/4th the budget I'm positive I could have done a much better job. Everyone was telling me how stupid thus movie is but I was bored and trusted the reviews here instead. I should've listened to real people. Not the neo vegetarian malnourished feminists that would enjoy this. This should've been a straight to Lifetime movie.",2016

4,"I'd like to begin by saying the original 2005 Sin City is one of my favorite movies. The way it was put together, the cinematography, the characters, the dialogue...everything. It was truly a breakthrough film. This sequel however is a letdown. It's not the type of letdown where the product can't match the hype, it's just everything I enjoyed about the first movie turned over. Yes, A Dame to Kill For is still broken into chapters and shot in B/W with occasions flashes of color, and I loved the allusions to the previous film and comic books- however, in contrast to the rich character depth and storyline, the storyline(s) is flat, bland, and lacks the energy the dialogue contained in the previous film. Also, the storyline isn't remotely as interwoven as it was in the previous, the directors struggled to keep the chapters intertwined-the *only* connection being Kadie's Bar, which all of the characters visited at least once. I appreciated that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller attempted to bring humor into the mix, but Marv's second, ""I hope you don't mind me saying this...."" scene really doesn't belong in the movie.

7,"A Dame to Kill for is by no means a boring or bad film. It succeeds as a satisfying sequel to the far more novel and perhaps stronger Sin City... it is bloody, violent, beautifully made, with cool deep voices, nudity and clearly fitting into the film noir genre. Where it falls short is in the charactersationssliding a bit, the strength of two original stories, the change in actors and the gap between the first and second film. There is also a desperate need for more iconic moments which the Sin City comics and the film has plenty of, but they never really come in A Dame to Kill for. ",2014

1,"This sequel is simply a Bizzaro version of the original, and what I mean by that is that every scene from the first film was like a positive exposure of a black and white photograph, while every scene here is the exact negative exposure of that same black and white photo. Every memory I have of the original film has a direct correlation to something seen here in the sequel, with the exception of a real opening or closing scene. That important piece (Josh Hartnett's cameo) was clearly missing here because it was a clever way to needle a thread through the tales about to be told and leads to an ending scene which cleverly sums up what we saw throughout the film starting with that first scene. The fact that this movie just opens up with a very flimsy and rehashed amnesia scene similar to the tale of Marv from the first movie (minus the hot blonde girl) is a sign that we are in for something similar yet different this time? Please allow me to explain. Marv now finds himself with another case of amnesia...another short confusing tale begins, which is severely lacking the quick, witty dialogue, that allowed Rourke to steal the show in the original. We watch him retrace his steps and it all leads back to him murdering 4 very wimpy men who apparently have never been in a fight before. Considering there isn't anything seen here that wasn't already encountered in the original, this opening sequence only succeeds in extracting all of the charisma and mystique created for Marv throughout the original. Next, we are introduced to a new character, Johnny, played by Joe Gordon-Levitt. Initially, he seems to fit in this world, he's got some charm and cleverness about him and there is a slight hope of originality displayed in this story, involving a poker game with the senator character introduced in the first film, essentially giving off the same kind of good vs evil vibe here, just as in the original. We are left with Johnny facing the same fate as all other male characters in the original. Johnny boy takes a solid beating and is left for dead all bruised up and deformed, so... now he's ready to get his revenge and truly enter the grimy legend of Sin City right? NOPE, doesn't happen. What does happen? We are left hanging for about an hour or so before we see him again and there he is, re-introduced to us, all bruised up and again playing poker with the evil senator...The exact same situation from earlier except he's in for revenge this time, right?...NOPE! It won't happen. Basically the only thing that we get from the Johnny story is a contrived excuse to demonize the senator, and, as for Johnny, it turns out he was just some dumb but lucky fool who let his ego grow way too large for his brain to handle. Next, we are introduced to Josh Brolin's story, or what the filmmakers are trying to portray as a re-introduction to the character, Dwight, played in the original by Clive Owen, which was his best role in my opinion. This time around, Clive Owen, I mean, Josh Brolin, is reduced to a dull, lifeless, wanna-be, hero type, who is, essentially, a guy who has delusions of grandeur about his inner rage which, which unlike in the original movie, is never to be on display. Sadly, all of this just made me miss Clive Owen's Dwight that much more. The gorgeous Eva Green is introduced to us here as a dame to kill for, channeling the Carla Gugino bares it all scene from the original. She is completely nude for what seemed to be about ten minutes of screen time. Why? because there's not much else going on here. The filmmakers seemingly hit the jackpot by casting her, because she's the only actress willing to expose herself in the exploitative way the filmmakers most likely wanted the other actresses to do. At this point I will cut my review short because I believe the filmmakers cut the movie short and wanted to turn it into a lame soft-core porn flick, mainly because they knew they didn't have much to begin with. If only they would have spared us the re-introduction of the Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP) character played by Dennis ""don't quit your day job as the voice of the Allstate commercials"" Haysbert. If only they would have spared us the waitress role being reprised by a hideous looking and aptly named Lady Gaga, originally played by the sexy, yet angelic, Brittany Murphy. (RIP) If only they would have spared us the worst Bruce Willis cameo since Ocean's Twelve, playing a ghostly Obi Wan Kenobi figure for Jessica Alba to obsess over? If only they would have spared us watching the two shady detectives (Michael Madsen) story from the original played by two very fine actors Jeremy Piven and Chris Meloni who, in a cringe-worthy effort, essentially, just mail this one in for a paycheck. If only they would have spared us watching the beautiful Jessica Alba shake it for 90 minutes before giving her the main hero role for the final story, which only serves to help us realize she was perfect as she was in the first film, just twirling around the pole not really having much to do but look pretty. If only they would have spared us seeing Rosario Dawson's character, so hot and sexy the first time around, reduced to some dreary, mo-hawked, freaky looking prostitute character, who had no real reason to be in the sequel other than to tie the link between the Clive Owen/Josh Brolin character. In summation, the only lasting memory the filmmakers want you to have, is of Eva Green completely nude. To that, I say to the filmmakers of this abortion AKA a sequel, Robert ""don't call me Tarantino"" Rodriguez and Frank ""don't call me Nosferatu"" Miller...Mission accomplished!",2014

8,"...because ""Grantchester"" is ideal winter viewing on your favourite sofa.Beautifully photographed,nicely acted,with two sympathetic main characters who will no doubt grow on us as the series progresses. If you're looking for envelope - pushing stuff then you need to go elsewhere,but for reassuring English detective fiction,""Grantchester"" fills the bill nicely. An attractive couple are swimming in Byron's Pool(he was an undergraduate at Trinity College where he allegedly kept a bear in his room).Afterwards they sit on the riverbank ,talking gaily.When they leave,the girl gets on a train back to London and the man rides his bicycle to Grantchester where he changes his clothes whilst listening to Sidney Bechet playing ""Indian Summer"" and it is apparent that he is a vicar about to conduct a funeral.The deceased is a suicide,and in the 1950s when the show is set,it was considered a sin to take one's own life and almost impossible to find a clergyman to officiate at such a service. Clearly,then,this is no ordinary vicar. After the ceremony a mysterious woman tells him that the deceased did not take his own life but was murdered. And so the first episode begins in a not unfamiliar fashion. It transpires that ""Indian Summer"" was very appropriate because his girl dumps him for someone richer,leaving him a Labrador puppy in her stead. He informs the police(in the shape of the excellent Mr Robson Green who eases up on his stroppy Geordie schtick a bit and is all the better for it).His suspicions are dismissed at first but gradually as he digs deeper a dastardly plot is revealed and justice prevails. There are a couple of period details that jar - England vs Hungary did result in a 6 - 3 defeat but was not played in the evening and ""Wasting police time"" was not created as an offence until at least thirty years later ,but otherwise the dialogue and mise - en - scene is pretty near perfect. ""Grantchester"" is written with love by James Runcie - a Cambridge man - and performed with affection by an excellent cast. Of course it could have been written any time in the last sixty years but in these troubled times that is not necessarily a bad thing. Lovers of nosey vicars and gruff but kindly coppers will love it.",2014
9,"Maybe Patzak1974 is unaware that this series is based on stories by James Runcie, son of a former Archbishop of Canterbury who had himself served as a tank commander in WW2 before being ordained. Though James wasn't born until 1959, I think we can assume that he based the character of Sidney on conversations he had had with his father about his wartime experiences and how they affected his faith.",2014
9,"I have not read the books. Therefore I enter as a virgin into the land of Grantchester. So, to me, it is a pleasant, light, somewhat funny, charming show. If we accept the idea that the Director meant to make the show in that way, I think that it is successful. I think the acting is excellent, and the stories are within reason, and interesting,but not hard-hitting because the show is not meant to be ""film noir"". It is light entertainment. I don't have to really believe that a Vicar, Sidney Chambers (James Norton),is regularly solving murders with his friend, Geordie, the police detective. I need not believe that a seemingly small town would have so many murders--one or more weekly--OK, let's say the time frame is two months apart, still.....you get it. So I give this show a 9 because I do enjoy it. I particularly like the acting of James Norton as the Vicar, but all are good.",2015
9,"James Norton and Robson Green are both excellent as Sidney Chambers and Geordie Keating. And Tessa Peake-Jones is perfect as Mrs. Maguire. Chambers housekeeper and would be conscience: not that he needs one. Chambers is trying to redeem his life. During WWII he fought with the Scottish Guards and saw his share of death. As a minister he is more willing than most to forgive some human failings but that does not diminish his need to see justice done. In his position, he finds that people are willing to confide in him and those confidences make him a detective of sorts. He works with the local police through Geordie Keating, a family man who while a reluctant partner at first, warms quickly to the young, handsome minister and accepts him as a partner. Sidney, he discovers, is not the quiet sherry sipping minister of stereotype but a man who prefers his whiskey (Scotch) neat, suffers from the occasional flashback to incidents from the war, and like women: especially Amanda Kendall (Morven Christie). The episodes run a quick hour and are a comfortable as a British cozy. I admit to enjoying British period pieces as Foyle's War, and this show is a welcome addition to the genre. I gather it has been renewed for a second season so I have hope PBS will also pick up that season.",2015
10,"Just happened upon this new mystery series. I have a life long love affair with UK Mystery Series. I adore the new Father Brown Series with Mark Williams of *Harry Potter & more fame* (Adore Alex Price as SID) and... At first glance you may think this a similar series, however this is not the case, quite the opposite. Father Brown is upbeat and moves quickly. Grantchester is moody, brooding and moralistic. Every episode delivers a heavy haunting message. I am fascinated with the ending sermonettes, recounting it's previous tale into a tasteful dose of morality via reality. For this and many more reasons, I think I am mesmerized. I think it will be easy for folkes to become enthralled with the lead character/priest, James Norton, whom may be my new secret love. Handsome, He truly is remarkable in this role. Truly believable and immediately relat'able as a person conflicted with strolling down a safe path vs racing a treacherous country road with lust and gusto. His face is intoxicating. This time piece is peacefully captured with vignettes of rich objects identifying a long gone world of wonderment and scenery serene to dye your soul. I discovered this series, having just re-watched every episode of Wire In The Blood with Robson Greene, I looked Robson up to find he is playing a DI in Grantchester...His character in this is quirky, yet very direct, leaving the conflicts with his soul at Wire In The Blood and to his newfound friend and cohort in crime. I hope this series runs forever, or a least a few more years.",2014
8,"Two extremely hot men (in my opinion), James Norton and Robson Green, star in ""Grantchester,"" a series about a vicar (Norton) and the mysteries he solves with the help of a local police detective (Green).",2015
9,"Another generally awesome series: England in the postwar period (like about a million other British shows, set in their favorite time after they kept calm and carried on and beat down the Nazi's along with us). Murders. Super cute intellectual and troubled vicar. Nerdy gay assistant vicar. Copish working class cop detective who lets the vicar team up with him. Landladyish meddling church lady housekeeper. English village. Beer drinking in charming pubs. ",2017
9,"Terrific. BBC does it again. LOVE the cast.. great ensemble. Mysteries excellent. Beautiful country. England after WW ll done well. James Norton a big beautiful hunk as the minister rides a bicycle, and the country side he rides thru has me planning to visit Grantchester .... Robson Green the local Irish police inspector is as always terrific to watch. Can't say enough good things about Grantchester. It's got it all. Dashing and sensitive leading man ( and a vicar to boot!) gruff policeman with a heart of gold and a gay curate. There are even a few clever and amusing women thrown in ( What the Dickens!) However, this is not just about solving murders in a small village in England; it explores the effects of the second world war on many people, plus the ""class thing"" in England and let's not forget love, mostly unrequited! Throughly enjoyable and I can't wait for season 2.",2015
5,"I like Grantchester for the period costumes and the Cambridgeshire setting, the plots are rather tame but what I do dislike about it is that the attitudes that it portrays are so anachronistic. The scriptwriters are becoming more determined to add in 21st century attitudes and to be politically correct, and this is completely out of place for a drama set in the 1950s. I had a rolling eyes moment when Chambers and Keating greeted each other with a hug - for heaven's sake, British men didn't even do that in the 1980s, let alone the 1950s! A handshake would have been a sign of affection but a hug - absolutely not. I really can't see a vicar that I would have known in my youth (in the 1970s) let himself go to that extent, I'm thinking in particular or the 'simulated sex on the dance floor scene' - even non-clergy wouldn't have behaved like that in the 1950s. People just didn't behave like that in public.",2017
9,"As we here in the US await the premiere of series 3 (June 18, 2017), I felt like I had to add to the (sad minority of) comments who love this show. I also have to add that I have no idea what a vicar's life was like, then or now, so had no expectations of Sidney, his romantic entanglements, or his ""ghostly father"" duties (if I may borrow from the Bard for a sec). I simply took the episodes at face value and eagerly watched as each story unfolded.",2017
6,"Disclaimer: I have read the books and am very disappointed in how ITV has brought them to television, but I'll try to avoid criticisms that are merely, ""It's not the way it was in the book."" (Although I have plenty of them!)",2014
4,"For example just once it would be neat if a priest actually believed that when someone does something as evil and selfish as taking their own life they should not be put to rest in consecrated ground. Wouldn't that be a surprise? Or how about one that actually believed that unmarried sex, or sodomy is a sin? Seems like for TV priests the only thing that is sinful is to not be sufficiently politically correct. I am not saying there is anything wrong with sex before marriage, or being gay, or anything else that makes people happy and hurts no one. However, if someone could care less about the Bible(or only the parts they like), perhaps they should be something other then a priest. Other then that...the show is mediocre, and frequently insults your intelligence. This is nothing but some liberal morality play pretending to be a coizy mystery. Nothing cozy about it.",2017
6,"I very much enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 - another ""cozy"" mystery series, gorgeously filmed and well-acted. The mysteries themselves are self-contained from episode to episode, while character development story arcs take place in the background to tie things together. As other reviewers have noted, the writers have made hero Sidney Chambers remarkably liberal and modern in his views. Perhaps in 1953 there were small-town vicars with such attitudes, but after a while it feels unrealistic. ",2017
9,"Grantchester since the very first episode has been particularly good viewing, the concept of a clergyman helping the local detective solve all manner of village crimes initially seemed a wee bit far fetched,and better suited to the Father Brown afternoon slot,but it's totally engaging, intriguing, and sometimes contains a level of grit.",2017
4,Shows with lead characters that can inspire and encourage you in the pursuit of virtuous character grow fewer and further between with each passing decade. ,2017
9,"Awhile back I wrote some more negative reviews of this show...mostly centered around the improbability that a clergyman would be solving murders. Took awhile, but once I got over that stumbling block, I started to really enjoy this show. The show is 50% solving crimes and 50% an intimate portrait of the show's primary characters. All the characters are likable despite some major flaws. The Season 3 finale was exceptional. Lots of love, tears and forgiveness. Love the period setting and costumes. Love the cast and acting. Good story lines and love the gay theme via Leonard and Daniel. James Norton, who plays Sidney, is superb and quite easy on the eyeballs. Hope the show lasts longer. PBS, here in the USA, is really struggling to get something as good as Downton Abbey was.",2017
5,"I love period crime dramas. Loved Sherlock Holmes (with Brett) and Poirot (with Suchet). Liked some of Father Brown too, but like that series this one is flawed (unlike Holmes or Poirot). The main problem I have is that in a rush to cater to women and romance (I feel) they have thrown out some common sense. Mainly most things to do with Christianity. Quite odd for a vicar. And added instead emotional baggage to do with the war that conveniently pops up to make women swoon for the lead character. Otherwise, this could be a brilliant series. Series 2 seems to tone it down a bit and focus a bit more on the crimes and is therefore better. There were episodes in series 1 that I just gave up watching due to incredulity, thats why I can only give 5/10. Would have liked to have rated higher.",2016
4,"I reasonably enjoyed the first 2 seasons, but I'm done with this series now. I don't need to waste any precious time watching sleaze - as in the inspector cheating on his lovely wife & family with the tramp. And after all this time of Sidney ""sitting on the pot"" where Amanda is concerned (she's always been throwing herself at him, while he's acted unmotivated), suddenly they've got to have one of those (YAWN) typical, modern, crass slam-bang scenes - UGH.

1,"I'm a Persian, I watched the movie last night and I think it was really unjust to our history, and it's not making it OK by simply saying that it was made upon a comic book, there are many points which I couldn't close my eyes on and this is why I'm writing this. if you don't care about the accuracy of historical events you will probably enjoy the movie and in that case you don't need to read this review just move on to the next. But if you are aware of the conflicts between the east and west, the history of Greko- Persian wars and relationships etc you will suffer thorough the movie and here is why: 1- The history is twisted in the movie and very one sided 2- The movie makers present Persians as terrorists since they use suicide bombers to win the battle which is a shame, how could they relate something that accrued just in the recent history to a great nation like Persia!. 3- The Persian king Xerxes, is presented as a cowered, Darius, father of Xerxes was killed by Themistokles, a Greek general, and before his last breathes he tells Xerxes that ""do not repeat my mistake, only gods can defeat Greeks""! while Darius never left Persia to attend this war and he was not killed by Themistokles and until this day, Iranians are visiting his tomb and paying him respect. 4- The customs for Iranian soldiers and the king himself are simply Arabic customs, the general who trained Artemisia is a black person, with my respect to Arabs and every other racial group, I'm I the only one who notices this movie and feels deeply sorry for the racist movie makers?! Is it hard to tell Persians and Arabs and Blacks apart? It's just sick man who are these wild, not civilized people with long beards in this movie? With a simple look at the statues of Persepolis you can find out how Persians looked like. 6- Muhammad Dandamayev a Russian historian, mentions in his famous book ""A political history of the Achaemenid empire""; that after the Spartans killed the Persians messengers they realized what a big mistake they did and sent two soldiers to Persia so they can be killed instead of the Persian messengers and Xerxes tells them ""I would be like a nation that violated the internationally known values and performed a disrespecting act of cowardliness"" apparently this scene was shown as a remarkable thing to do in the movie 7- Last and most important point is in the movie, the Persians did not care about the slaves and the soldiers who were killed but the Greeks were defending not only their country but the freedom and democracy and apparently they don't have any slaves working for them, while slavery was widely spread at that time and it wasn't like the recent slavery of African people, the color did not matter and the Greeks were using them to build their citadels like Acropolis, surprisingly the Persians were paying workers to build Persepolis! the reason I remember this one in particular is that it was discovered just recently, archaeologists found some payment receipts made of rocks if I'm not mistaken belonged to workers who participated in building Persepolis from different nations. Democracy does not have the same meaning as the democracy we know nowadays, it's funny how this movie reflects the American perspective toward Middle-east.",2014
1,"The story is a long way from reality, Persian characters all have come from the mind of the patient's Writer, This movie is more damaging to Persians and no purpose other than. However, the only thing that did not distort history and not more. ",2014
2,"How could you mess up a sequel to 300? The story of the first movie was simple and straight forward, yet jam packed with wit and beautiful details...and came along with a look that was fresh and sexy, very self assured and uncompromising. ",2014
1,So the Movie starts off with a pretty OK fighting scene.,2014
6,"I can't understand why Zack Snyder didn't direct this sequel, and how someone who has never directed an action sequence before and just one feature film can be entrusted with a production of this magnitude. That would already be a recipe for disaster, even though in reality Snyder was supervising.",2014
1,"So, the last stronghold of men has been pillaged. The original 300 was about strong, brave, reckless men who would die for glory. This sequel is about a girl who outwits the whole Persian empire and defeats men in their own game. Eva Green's character was so unnaturally forced into 300's universe just to have that ""strong female main character"" that it was obscene. No Leonidas, no Spartans, a childish Xerxes whose only role in the film was to be an idiot so that Eva Green character's ""wittiness"" could come to light, and a terrible main character (forgot his name already). I won't even go into the storyline because the real story here is that the spirit of the original 300 has been utterly destroyed. This movie is so politically correct it's stupid, I guess this is what gets money nowadays. I just really hope this movie does badly so that the people who made it give a second thought before killing a franchise next time.",2014
1,"It was not even a waste of time because i got time to review mentally the real history of the Battle of marathon whilst dying watching this 3D movie. Firstly, I am tired of the dualism that Hollywood tries to portray when producing these movies: good vs bad. Portrays Greeks as clean, democratic, free civilization,... OK, but always vs dirty, vain, bloody Persians...!!! All that to get viewers to lean towards what they have to judge is good or wrong (america - middle east...). The movie does not portrays a single thing that was real at that time, not even the boats, ...neither, obviously, Artemisa who ""represents""a Goddess. Overall, I am not even sure I want to write much about this movie. In fact the chopping hands, heads, blood and bad 3D are representative of what I thought it was an old style of making movies, probably addressed to -sorry- ignorant viewers or those who are satisfied with bloody movies regardless of how misleading they can be. Don't watch it, a waste of time and waste of money....",2014
3,"1. The back story of the villains in this film is more interesting than the story of the 2-dimensional leads in it. 2. The cartoon blood was distracting. I half expected to see some ACME Anvils land on some Persian dude's head. 3. The slow motion to fast motion gimmick was old 5 years ago, and if we want to see 300 style action sequences, we will watch 300. Beautiful imagery, but I'd rather see paintings of it rather than 2 hours of slow- mo. 4.Under explained stakes and characters. I still have no idea why anyone was fighting and what they were fighting over really. And furthermore I felt more sad for the lead villain who was raped repeatedly as a slave child rather than the leading men who think it's cool to have sex with the enemy. And the other heroes from 300 are a culture of people who not only beat children but discard BABIES if they are not born perfectly. These are our heroes? The Persians at least didn't mention that in their back story. 5. This film is almost all exposition. Nearly 80% of the dialogue is either Braveheart style speeches to 10,000 soldiers who somehow can hear one man without a microphone, or two over-acting characters speaking in inconsistent British accents to remind the audience of what's going on and what they're going to do. 6. If you can't get Gerard Butler to perform ANY speaking lines in the film, just cut him out completely. It was laughable how many times they did the ""OH, Your favorite character, GERARD BUTLER, JUST left..you JUST missed him..so here is stock photos from the last movie of him...and oh his wife and this guy were in the last movie...and you know them...so they will speak on his behalf"" 7. King Leonidas' wife is just as skilled as any Spartan on the battlefield and leads them from the front lines? OK. 8. If Hollywood is going to only make remakes, reboots, and adaptations of earlier works, they should at very least think a bit more on the script before pooping it out. There is no substance in this film, no real story, no stakes, and worst of all, no serious supporting actor. 9. On a positive note, the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Comedy gold. 10. I cannot take this movie seriously, and I am their target audience. Worth a DVD rental for some fun, but even in 3D it gets old.",2014
2,"As the credits began to roll, i sat for a moment, allowing it all to sink in. Had i just witnessed the most disappointing sequel ever? I had not felt this disheartened by a sequel since ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" Like ""The Matrix"", ""300"" for me was excellent; groundbreaking. Fresh and original. And then instead of leaving it as is, they decide to bring in the cash cow and milk it dry. I loved ""300""; the action was engrossing, the story was compelling, it was an instant classic. And i never wanted to hear the announcement of an unnecessary sequel. My gut churned when i heard it. But i never thought in my worst nightmares that it would be as bad as it was. The trailer baits you in, with what seemed a promising plot. And left intrigue. By the end of the film it is clear that it was nothing more than a cheap ruse.",2014

3,As a movie it is OK but as a sequel to 300 it is insulting at best. As soon as the movie begins the first thing you notice is its in full colour and within a few minutes you realise that a lot of it has been shot around the basis of 3d. I'm not a massive fan of 3d however i don't mind it when it fits to the film whereas the film fits to the 3d here instead. Gone is the slow motion beauty although it is attempted it seriously falls flat. If that is not enough the huge army of Persia is gone and instead the film is pretty much boat based which is dull at best. The whole movie is contained in the trailer. The whole get from a to b in a special way at the end was about as unbelievable as it gets. The title is fully misleading as Spartans hardly appear at all except for about two minutes and despite attempting to explain why a god-king becomes a god-king there is no empire included in this movie save for the few boats.,2014
1,"After reading some of the reviews left by movie goers for this film I am rather pleased. Pleased, that I'm not the only person who despised this film. I didn't actually have high hopes for the film to start as most movies this year have been let downs. Well this one was no different..",2014
5,"The film is based as a backdrop to the original 300 storyline and paves a wave for the next part in the franchise but all the way it just drained the legacy of 300. The hero gives uninspiring talks with beats in the background score rising to make the army automatically charged up to start fighting and die... its very nonsensical just like Themistokles saying "" Today is the day we water the plants"" and with rising music the army responds hu rahhh and they get into the battle.

8,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" will be no surprise in delivery other than it is possibly better than the first? There will, still, be fight scenes reminiscent of flawless dance moves, and the great choreography is what lends the film to being a great 'dance' movie (hello Step-Up 3hundred). The difference in approach comparatively between the two films would be the perverse nature of the second's delivery of the story at hand. The first had a far more romantic predisposition.",2014

1,"i am sicked and tired of Hollywood mess up with Greek history once again!! for god's shake is it so difficult to study some history before they decide to make a movie based on those facts? we are used to watch them ruin our mythology but it's even worse to do it with our history. where to begin and where to stop? Themistocles had nothing to do with marathon it was Miltiades and he used a brilliant battle tactic which is worth mentioning. Persians did not burn Athens. that was the point of Salamina battle, to defend the city ""with wooden walls"".

6,"After The Ruin, a colorless equalitarian society is formed without memories and everyone follows rules established by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) and the Elders. The population uses drugs to stay happy and on the day of the graduation, the teenagers leave their childhood and are assigned to a career chosen by the Elders. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) lives with his parents and has two best friends, Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan), and he feels different from his friends. He is assigned to be the Receiver of Memories and he is trained by his mentor, The Giver (Jeff Bridges), who gives memories of the world before The Ruin. Jonas learns emotions such as love and fear and the concept of family. When he discovers that the baby Gabriel that he loves as a brother will be eliminated, he decides to change his society but the Chief Elder will do anything to stop him.",2015
8,"If you think that the world that George Orwell created in 1984 was a rigid one they were positively hedonistic compared to the society shown in The Giver. Playing the title role is Jeff Bridges who is called that because he has a very special duty to be the one entrusted with the memories of the past. The ruling body of the society has to be able to refer to the past to be guided in making decisions. But we can't have everyone knowing about lest they long for the good things of the past. It's all been abolished the good and the bad, conformity and sameness is the order of things. Color is not even allowed everyone wears drab clothing like they were in prison. The family is abolished, kids are born and then assigned to nurturers, women particularly go into that occupation and it is an occupation like being a plumber. ",2015
8,"""The Giver"" from the movies is certainly different from the original text, yet one can't be disappointed because it remains faithful to many of its elements. Looking at the incredible work done by the designers, one has to admit that this is a fairly accurate representation of what a sterile, safe, and totalitarian society probably would like in the future. The general population follows the rules automatically, with minor exceptions, and the illustrious leaders make sure their presence is respected and understood. People appear to be content.",2014
7,"I have not read the book and certainly will not after seeing the movie. Basically it felt like a mash up of several recent films, combining the futuristic and oppressive world where people are not allowed to feel, the rules that are ""for the good of the people"" and where people are being assigned their roles in life, where everything is iPhone white and boring gray and where there are some young adolescent heroes that are willing to change the world. The movie ends with a horrible deus ex machina that makes everything work out fine, despite any reasonable expectation.",2014
10,"I have seen reviews comparing the Giver (unfavorably) to other teen dystopian movies like Divergent and Hunger Games. That's actually a compliment, the Giver is not more of the same stuff, The critics seemingly can't accept that people are smart enough to get the point of Lois Lowry's book, and that people aren't smart enough to enjoy, much less understand, a character study and a societal study. Mindless action, needless violence, and transforming robots are all absent here. I have a feeling though, that people are smarter than they think. The book has been popular for at least 30 years, why would people balk at the movie adaptation? The Giver is a project that has been in the back of every movie maker's mind for years, now it's here. Go see it and judge for yourself.",2014
10,"Everyone is judging this movie based on its accuracy to the book, which is understandable. I re-read the book 2 days ago, so it would be fresh in my head before viewing the movie for the first time. I absolutely love the book, and I had heard varying opinions about the movie (mostly negative), but I wanted to watch it with an open mind and present my own opinion. I must say: this movie is simply amazing. Firstly, the acting is top-notch: Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges were perfect of course, but Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush also brought depth to their characters. I loved seeing Taylor Swift make an appearance in the film, and she gave life to a character who was only mentioned in the book. Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgård showed flawless acting in their supporting roles as well. The movie excelled in more than just its acting. There were so many powerful ""chilling"" moments, particularly with the portrayal of the memories. The contrast of the sensory-rich memories of the past with the colorless and boring Utopian community is what brought real depth to the film. My favorite aspect was the slow transition from black-and-white to vivid colors. My only true complaint about the movie is that it was too short. I didn't want it to end. As far as staying true to the book, there were minor changes, such as the ages of the characters and the career assignments, but these made sense. People must understand that when a book is adapted on screen, there are certain things that must change for viewing continuity purposes. I will say that, as always, the characterization was better in the book, and I was able to form a connection with the characters quicker with a written description. The movie jumped right into the plot, which was good for the pacing of the story, but this meant it took longer to really understand the characters. Having already read the book, this was not a problem for me. The overall themes and concepts (such as sameness, colors, emotion, and love), were portrayed ingeniously throughout the movie. As much as I love the amazing use of imagery in the book, being able to actually visualize the transition from a dull community to a vivid, colorful world was breathtaking. Also, without giving spoilers, the movie gives explanations to concepts in the book, especially with the ""memory boundary"" that separates the society from Elsewhere. The movie doesn't stray from the book, it just provides more clarity. Finally, I loved the ending of the movie. It gives more closure, and was even more satisfying than the book was. My overall conclusion is that this movie serves as an excellent counterpart to the book. The detailed characterization of the book and the sensory stimulating scenes in the film complement each other nicely to make one cohesive, stunning, and powerful story.",2014

7,"Books are a means of allowing the imagination to unfold without a budget to hold back your creativity. Yet in Hollywood they are ultimately a means to write the next big blockbuster to draw people to the theaters. This weekend yet another adapted screenplay comes to life in the form of the Giver.

10,"Overall, The Giver was a good, quality movie. It conveyed an important message: we need the bad in order to appreciate the good. I definitely plan on buying it when it comes out on DVD.",2014
4,"The most obvious and cynical theory to come up with the existence of The Giver movie is the success of futuristic YA movies such as The Hunger Games and Divergent. Though, The Giver was never meant to be a YA book in the first place, and it's already a two decades old book that has been going through some controversies in the past. This movie is proof that Hollywood is just picking books randomly and turn them into movies to match the trend. The important question is does it stay true to what makes the story so great? Apparently not. Not because it's now starred with teenagers instead of twelve year olds, or it consists more action scenes. The film just hardly cares about the concept and gives more way to the corny clichés of the genre. The Giver does have a taste for a blockbuster, but the heart of the story is missing and that is definitely frustrating.",2014
7,"At it's core this is a movie with a very worn out theme of Ubertypical Americanness: Communism vs Capitalism (ofen inaccurately labeled Democracy or Market Freedom). It's about the choice between strong, oppressive community values versus individual choice.

Think the aliens in Starship Troopers and Battle Star Galactica.",2014
6,"I went into the movie with high expectations after having read the book in high school. I absolutely loved the book and always imagined it to be a certain way.

There were many scenes that I would have loved to see but were not included. ",2014
8,"""The Giver"" is one of my favorite books, my eighth grade self could feel the emotions of Jonas as he received his first memories, cringe as his friends became unscathed by murder, and in awe as he watched a colorless apple turn red. The movie explores the concept of losing touch with emotion- in a way that was better than I expected. I thought my fantasy of making ""The Giver"" come to life exactly as I had imaged it would take hold and send me wining about how ""I could have made a better movie!"" Well, it did give life to the book, although it was through different ways (like a kiss, the nursery for babies, or a punch)- ways that were more appealing to an audience visually. I do wish the red apple had been the first color to appear- oh well! I was a little sad at not keeping the sense of complete mystery as to what happens to Jonas's town after he crosses the border of memories. Also, frequent flashes of memories distracted me at times (like what am I watching again?), but they did give insight into Jonas's onset of new thoughts- the movie would feel bleak without them. It seems I left the theater believing in the necessity of feeling all emotions, and relieved for the fictional society of no memories having to deal with life itself! A thought-provoking movie I am glad to have seen. After all if you can't feel, what's the point?",2014

7,"saw 'the giver' last night at the fathom events screening. It was my favorite book growing up when i read it in school and maybe the reason I wasn't horribly disappointed was because it didn't even look great from the previews. nonetheless, i watched the movie. having recently read the book in preparation for the movie, the first thing that stood out to me was how quickly they jumped into the memories. It takes about ten chapters of the book to get there, and the movie gets there in less than ten minutes. it cuts out all the build up of the book and depending on how you like the speed of your films, this could be good or bad. this could pinpoint to why the movie didn't completely work. the script was rushed. it is definitely a case of 'when good actors happen to bad scripts'. because of the nature of the script (or because the nature of the movie, who knows?) the actors aren't given much to work with. this may not be their fault as the whole point of the story is a dystopian society where they don't allow you emotions, but to watch actors have straight faces for 94 minutes isn't exactly a pleasant experience. it leaves you feeling meh about the whole thing as i did. shame.",2014
1,"I shall start this review with the staple comment. I loved the book. This movie is awful. And I don't mean ""they changed a couple of things and now I feel it is true to the original"". I mean, they changed a lot, including the subtext, it has internal inconsistencies, and it is no longer the same story. I couldn't even stay to finish the movie, and below I will state where I departed. For this reason, I give it the score as low as possible. ",2014
8,"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it,however I'm going to review this movie purely on the movie. There is also a reason I never read a book right before the movie comes out,I want to judge it on it's own merits. I really enjoyed The Giver,it really made me feel. It celebrated life and everything that comes with it;love,joy,laughter,sadness and everything in between. Things we take for granted like music. The story itself is pretty straightforward but that's not necessarily a bad things. Most of the acting was good, Jeff Bridges however was the stand out to me. Using black and white and colour to show what the community is lacking was used well.",2014

5,"Perhaps the book has something else, but this film just feels like a derivative mash-up of ""Brave New World"", ""The Village"", ""Soylent Green"" and ""The Matrix"", with some elements of ""Star Trek"" added in for good measure. The decision to start the film in Black and White, using colour as part of the later plot (no spoilers!) might have felt like a clever idea in pre-production meetings, but the execution just feels contrived and lame. Very little about the community or the unfolding plot feels either convincing or believable, and as a socio-political metaphor it feels very weak in comparison to ""The Matrix"" or ""Soylent Green"". Even the fairly weak 2004 effort ""The Village"" manages a much more convincing outing along the same lines.",2014
6,"Had I known Taylor Swift was in this movie, I might have been less enthusiastic about the film, however, I can promise you that any Taylor Swiftness on posters and in promo is all a marketing ploy.

The real star of the show is Brenton Thwaites as Jonas and he's really quite lovely in his role as the compassionate and curious Receiver.",2015

The Elders are not happy with what is going on and they do all they can to stop Jonas, but he will stop at nothing to make everyone remember. I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I never read the book and only caught glimpses of trailers. I expected another teenager-y save the world movie so I sat down with pretty low expectations. I have to say that I was very surprised at how much I liked this. The easiest way to describe this is a combination of Divergent and Pleasantville. When you watch you will see exactly what I mean (as long as you have seen both of those movies). This is a great family movie and my entire family loved it. It is rated PG- 13 and I think it is because of one small part but you will not have to have your hand on the pause or fast forward button if you are watching this with your family. Overall, this is just a good movie that the whole family will enjoy. I give this a B+.",2014

It was fairly predictable to me though I am a HUGE movie fan over 5000 seen. Still it made me feel the way I felt the first time I watched Fast and Furious! I like how they had no stunt drivers and they trained Aaron Paul how to actually drive the cars to make it more real. They replicated the cars to ensure that if/WHEN they did wreck the cars they could truly wreck the cars with no CGI involved. Aaron Paul & Imogen seem to have great chemistry on screen that sells the story also.",2014

1,"This movie is terrible! It is God awful! And I don't mean this in that ""it's so bad that it's obviously on purpose and because of this it's fun"" sort of way.

But no one seemingly bothered to read the script and when it came time to shoot they said ""screw it, just go with it."" That is the only feasible explanation for why the entire script is made up of clichés executed as poorly as possible.

It's a fusion of hot mess with barely any charisma, only offering display of expensive cars, as the movie constantly brags, and high level of stupidity on everything it does. Fans would be better off attending car shows.",2014

8,"I remember the first time I saw the Fast and the Furious, and how it  made me feel after leaving the theatre. By the time the credits rolled,  I wanted to get into my car and drivefast. Unfortunately at the time,  I was just barely fourteen years-old and not even able to drive, let  alone drive fast. Since then, there have been five more entries to the  Fast franchise, a tragic death within the series and an upcoming  seventh entry that will no doubt pay homage to the late, great racing  action star Paul Walker. Obvious comparisons from this film will be  made to the Fast film franchise, but I can assure you that Need for  Speed will gracefully race near to, if not speed right in front of the  series that made street racing cool.  When was the last time you saw a car fly? Like actually fly? And I'm  not talking about the CGI filled James Bond/science-fiction films that  show flying cars with wings as the norm in the future. For the first  time in a very long time at the movies, I had fun! I held my arms  close, my palms were sweaty, and tension was flowing through me like  the warm synthetic engine oil of a race car, and it was all thanks to  the high-octane energy of Need for Speed.  Based on the famous video game franchise of the same name released in  1994, the film had many hurdles to overcome even before its release;  horrible track records among critics and in the box office for video  game film adaptations (Super Mario Bros., Doom, Max Payne); direct  comparisons to the Fast films; and a television star Aaron Paul  (Breaking Bad) leading the film. But despite all the hurdles, Need for  Speed delivers on its promise for an urgency to entertain, enthral, and  perform, giving a whole new realism to the illegal street racing action  genre.  Now the word realism can be misconstrued in the context of this review.  The disclaimer at the end of the film does state that ""many of the  stunts performed were done by trained professionals on closed courses"",  including the actors, who had extensive training with street cars and  performance racing. Now when I say realism, there is no way we can  explain that word without mentioning director Steve Waugh. Waugh, who  was a seasoned stunt performer before he became a director (Act of  Valor), on films like Bad Boys II, Spider-Man and The Italian Job,  opted for genuine stunt performances from his actors, director of  photography, and stuntmen, and mostly abandoned the use of CGI in the  film, which gives a slight edge to the longing of danger to be put back  into filmmaking.  The video games, which popularized the use of 'first-person racing',  put gamers in the driver's seat and revolutionized the way in which  racing games were made. Need for Speed may be light on story,  completely absurd on intent and plot, and have many two-dimensional  characters, but makes up for it in action, thrills, and impulsive  entertainment. The film then becomes a blend of buddy comedy/road-trip  actioner/hard boiled revenge thriller that will have you rooting for  our hero and born underdog Tobey Marshall, with every gear shift and  sharp turn ahead.  The film spends a hefty amount of time establishing its characters,  especially its lead Tobey Marshall (Paul). A natural behind the wheel  but behind on most of his payments on the shop his late father left him  in Mt. Kisco, N.Y, Marshall makes up for his payments and barely keeps  the shop afloat and his close friends employed through a string of  minor street races. After a generous offer from an old acquaintance,  pro NASCAR driver and suave bad boy Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper),  Marshall sees an opportunity for the business to flourish for him and  his group of loyal friends. But after Dino double-crosses Marshall in a  race for winner-takes-all, Marshall serves two years in prison, only  igniting a burning scheme for vengeance.  Need for Speed spends a dedicated amount of time behind the wheel with  it's characters. From the moment Marshall is released from prison, he  makes his way to California to the infamous, invite only De Leon street  race, held by an anonymous organizer. Desperate to use the last car  that he and his team worked on, a 50th Anniversary Ford Mustang that  Carroll Shelby reportedly worked on before his eventual death in 2012,  a car that produces 800+ horsepower and reaches a max speed of 234mph,  Marshall and his team, accompanied by the wealthy investor associate  Julia (Imogen Poots) race to an unknown location in search of proving  Marshall's innocence and making Brewster pay for the death of his  friend.  In addition to the hundreds of cars and parts that were damaged during  the production of the film, is the passion and very obvious enjoyment  of everyone involved. From Cooper, who has been very open about his  excitement to be in a racing film since the beginning of his career, to  Paul, who spent months dedicated to stunt driving, Need for Speed is a  film that can best be described by its resident veteran franchise  patriarch Michael Keaton, a film that was ""born to ride"".",2014
2,"The only need for speed required is a good fast forward button. What kind of doo-doo is this? Guy meets hot girl, jumps in fast car, and goes fast. Let me see, was there anything else? Hmmm – no. I kid, this was not the worst movie I ever wasted money on. For one thing, there are so many worse flicks floating around out there - and for another, I did not pay for it. So – hahahahaha. Also, this review is not all negative. There are some huge plusses I must mention. These jewels are hidden under one huge pointless- blanket, and I will try to uncover them. Aaron Paul did a good job – he spoke his lines and drove a fast car. I was very impressed. Imogen Poots played the pretty blonde to a 'T'. She superbly sat in the passenger seat, and did a fine job inhaling and exhaling - breathtaking. I almost forgot, she actually talked tooand, I think the words she spoke were extremely important to the plot. Hahahahaha – again. Just kidding – there was no plot. The rest of the cast were spectacular. They put gas in cars, got beat up or just plain raced against Aaron and Imogen. This is a must see movie.",2014
9,"I got to see an advanced screening of Need For Speed and I must say, despite a 2hr 10min running time, this film was extremely entertaining from start to finish. The film follows Toby, played by Aaron Paul, and his quest for revenge against a billionaire racer, played by Dominic Cooper, who killed his friend. The film's familiar plot gets excused for the mere fact that the action sequences in this film are amazing and keep you holding your breath. The lack of CGI is jaw dropping. It makes the action sequences in Fast & Furious 6 look like more of a video game than the basis for this film. It truly is amazing. Aaron Paul is very good in this film, while he is nowhere near the caliber of his famous Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad, he still proves that he is an amazing actor with great things ahead of him. Another surprise here is Kid Cudi, who gives a light hearted touch to the rough and tough story of revenge. Michael Keaton is another welcomed addition to this film as he lets the viewer get a better idea of who our anti-hero, Toby Marshall, truly is. Dominic Cooper is a down side of the film, unfortunately he weighs down the film with a typical evil billionaire performance, the only think he is missing is his pinky finger against his lips but it is just enough to overlook. Getting back to the basis of this movie, this is hands down the best video game adaptation ever made. It's hard to believe when watching it that this is a video game adaptation because it is actually good. This comes as proof that with good actors and directing, video games can be adapted correctly.",2014

2,"Do you like watching other people play racing video games? Have you longed to see a movie starring One Direction look-alikes who drive real fast? Do you wish car commercials were over two hours long? Then have we got a movie for you! Otherwise, Need for Speed will leave you dumbfounded at its dullness. The idea of making a movie out of a racing video game is bad enough; add-in flat characters, ridiculous dialogue and complete lack of excitement and what's left is worse than imagined. This is essentially a Fast and Furious knock-off, but one would imagine they would bring something new to the table. But, noit's completely formulaic. No surprise or intrigues exist at all. In fact, other than a couple of okay crash scenes and racing moments, tension and excitement are entirely absent. I longed for the ""thrill"" of the go-kart derby race in Little Rascals to replace the humdrum of the driving scenes here. Talent is just wasted everywhere. Poots (That Awkward Moment) and Keaton (RoboCop) are each 0 for 2 on movies this year, and Aaron Paul deserves a much better vehicle. He's not terrible, but his vulnerable, round-faced, boyish charm can only go so far. Worst of all is the morality of this film. The ""good guys"" are doing atrocious things. They're reckless, selfish, unlikable, pompous idiots, and we are supposed to root for them. All of this goes to show it really doesn't matter how ""cool"" or ""pretty"" you think you're movie is. If you don't have an exciting story, or decent script, all you have is glossy garbage.",2014

1,first of all i must say about the plot.there is nothing special.the plot is really predictable.plot is really thin and characters have nothing to do except resting their ass in cars.none of the actors will make an impression (including most acclaimed Aaron Paul) .and this film is the worst 3D film i saw.its converted to 3d just to make some more money.some races are splendid but weak plot spoiled everything.cars used are costly but you can miss some manufactures like Ferrari.music is OK.film is nicely adapted from game.you can see exactly a game but not the film.film run time is dragged.and writing is not so impressive.the only thing which impressed me is stunts performed without graphics used.crashing scenes are well executed. FINAL VERDICT:this is not even a film to watch for time pass.so please wait for DVD,2014

I'd rather watch Vin Diesel and his stupid monotone voice over and over again... then have to sit through a c***sh**t like this ever again.

I just can't believe how Director actually think that could be a awesome movie sequence. Not to mention the final pursuit..... I can believe that some an think that looks good.

Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.",2014
9,"Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our  childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the  unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little  resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved  so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap,  hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a  bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor  acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra).  So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego  Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than  a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy  store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets  of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most  original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has  quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014.  Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out  his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to  all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an  obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex  Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more  mustache-twirling insanity.  A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads  Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of  only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their  impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him  before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius  (Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and  WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most  hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a  plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise  fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all   provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad  Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman.  From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless  array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil  Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert  grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that  every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's  best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles,  and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules  established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen  must be possible to construct in the real world.  There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act  that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily  derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect  execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount  of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego  Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a  brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great  foundation to build on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously,  The Lego Movie is fantastic.  -- Brent Hankins",2014
9,"I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out ""chose one"" clichés and also rather poignant and touching. ",2014
10,I was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can say is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled.,2014
9,"If you watch the trailer and you think its just gonna be a fun stop-motion animated Lego movie, you were wrong. The Lego Movie is beyond fun. its creative and it brings back a lot childhood memories. The story was amazing, the jokes were hilarious, and they have great intention in details.",2014
10,"This is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other IMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a mistake to see this movie because it's just a ""toy"" movie. But that's what makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters throughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character development.",2014
8,"To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it.  The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders.  Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities.  The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.  Rating: 8/10",2014
8,"Went to see it with my brother. With the age difference between us we both loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It's amazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and interact with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and even some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You'd be surprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. ",2014
10,"This film has great animation and a great story, it has an all star voice cast example Morgan freeman and will Ferrell. This film will be up on the shelve as one of the greatest films ever animated, ever thought about and ever written. When I was a kid playing with Lego I never thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they have all my Christmases have come at once. Cant wait for the special features on blue ray. This movie will be up there with toy story 1 2 and 3 , the lion king , frozen and wreck it Ralph. The power of good films are in Lego hands people are genius congrats to all the Oscars for the road ahead",2014
6,"I usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy Story being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me. There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the 'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children commented on this.",2014
3,"I go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like it. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems like a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came home and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.",2014
2,"""The Lego Movie"" is irritatingly frenetic, smug, and so ugly to look at it hurt my eyes. Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but borrowings of borrowings. ""Jokes"" come fast and furious. They come so fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not. Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few seconds of ""Danny Boy."" This is supposed to be funny because Liam Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the chute. ",2014
1,"I absolutely hated this movie. Having paid for my family around £10 each to watch what is basically an advert for Lego, I just feel cheated. I didn't find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films funny, I didn't find the script funny. It was too loud, too slow, too ... rubbish for me to watch. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not but I have no idea what the ending was about, the whole Will Ferrell thing with it's preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being able to be creative - complete tosh. My family felt the same by the way. No amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide the fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype.",2014
5,I'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing all the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with the film...,2014
1,"This film was like watching a 1h40 advert for Lego. I think the fundamental problem is that Lego is a great medium for telling other people's stories, to which the plethora of characters in the film allude (Star Wars, Batman, pirates) but is not really an interesting subject for a story in itself. ",2014
1,"I took two 5 year old boys (who adore Lego, BTW) for this movie and could not have been more disappointed. they certainly didn't enjoy it. this is just not a movie for young children with it's mile-a-minute, wannabe hipster historical and cultural references and inside jokes. it was over-amped, overloaded with way too much chaos, fast action, and (impossible for children to follow) fast cuts . . . let's face it, it was generally full of pumped up nonsense. a group of stoned college kids in the back roared with delight. and sure enough, it felt like it was made by a group of 20-30 some-things with short attention spans who were terrified of making something sweet, slow, charming, amusing, gentle and kind. guess that's not the currency of the realm in Hollywood? I, for one, feel sorry for the children who get subjected to this cultural insanity in the theater and then go to school laced with Ritalin because they are hyperactive. feels like our culture is in a sad place and usurped by stupid commercialism. made me miss Jim Henson before he sold out. boo hiss.",2014
2,I have seen this movie a couple times now and I just do not get it. Really? This is what people are calling the best animated film of 2014?,2014
8,"A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.",2014
5,"In the Lego Movie, and evil minifig named Lord Business has decided that he is tired of all of the creative people messing around with his stuff. He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The masterbuilders can only count on the ""Special,"" a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.",2015
5,"This movie was so so SO overrated. The jokes were terrible and Emmett was insanely annoying! I mean the first line was, ""He's coming. Cover you butt."" The moment I heard that line, I knew the movie was gonna go downhill from there. And I was right! The jokes flew by so fast, they went right over my head. But the ones I did get... weren't funny at all. Now I will admit I enjoyed the character Unikitty (I know, a cat/unicorn. Stay with me). She was pretty funny with the whole happiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff (it's called irony). Plus the ending got boring. Around the time the people appeared on screen, the line cues got slower and slower (and more boring). Most people have been saying that the ending sucked (it did), but I like it because the movie finally ended. Anyway, this movie is bad! The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the animation actually was awesome. That was one of the few good things about this movie. So unless you only pay attention to the animation and not the story line, this is not for you.",2014
3,"If you want either a primer into the experience of having ADHD or an endless advertisement for Lego toys, then this unmitigated piece of rubbish is for you.",2015
10,"Some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. Very suspenseful, very disturbing, very brilliant. The filming style helps create this dark and well put together, well acted storyline. A must watch. The twist and turns of the story will keep you on edge through all the episodes. The feeling of a parents devastation for a child who is missing is woven through the whole series and will draw you in deep. The direction and production of this series is incredibly good. The frustration at the attitude of some authorities and police responses is felt deeply. The writing is superb. I can't praise this series enough. Gripping and suspenseful and Highly recommended viewing.",2015
10,"First review, but just finished watching Season 2.",2017
9,"One of my favourites on television from 2015, that's for sure..as well as being one of the best mini-series of this genre in recent years. To see top-notch production values, an absorbing story-line and great acting, 'The Missing' is essentially a must watch.",2016
10,"Somebody among the reviews said that the positive ones are paid for. Well, I'm not paid by anybody to review this show and I feel like giving it 10 stars because once I watched the pilot episode, I could not stop watching the rest of the show. Somebody might find the pace too slow, some others won't enjoy the acting, or the editing... whatever, I found it interesting, nicely done, realistic, dramatic, catching... I feel like recommending The Missing to anybody, although I respect the fact that it might not be for anybody. The whole show is characters' driven and it's about a couple losing their 5 year old child while on vacation in France. There's a lot of drama in it. If you're a parent you'll understand and ""enjoy"" the show even more, clearly. Again, it might not be your kind of entertainment, but I objectively think it's a well-done show worth to watch it. Can't wait for next season. PS: The show is 100% European, whether you like it.",2015
9,"This is a very slow, drawn out drama. I emphasise that because so many people give the thought provoking long drama negative reviews. Just not enough fast paced explosions for people. If that is what you like go to channel five or Hollywood. The BBC make gritty, real life dramas for the intelligent person who do not need fuel filled, jaw dropping moments to keep them interested. This programme is about people, relationships, how a moment can change your life forever. How people react so differently to situations and how it affects them. The actors take you on a journey, tony, so blinded by guilt and rage that at times you have no empathy for him whatsoever until you reflect on his loss and wonder how you yourself would react. I find the acting brilliant and i like the time skips, if at times, if you have blinked it gets a little confusing as to what era you are looking at particularly when the young french man goes to the UK. I was confused as to what era I was watching at one point. Besides that i am avidly waiting for the next episode, particularly after the 'jaw dropping' twist of the last episode with the boat incident (you see what i did there)?! Watch and enjoy and if you cannot sit still for a drawn out programme, go watch x factor!",2014
10,"Just watched the first 2 episodes of this amazing show & it blew me away. Brilliantly written, acted & executed, handled with great thought to the characters & keeping the suspense on going, 10 out of 10 in my book. The characters are believable & you can feel their pain & heartache. I also love the way the scenes skip back & forth too show you the past events & what has led up too the present ones.Can't wait until the end of the show too find out how it pans out.The ending of the first episode gave me goosebumps. I was on the edge of my seat with expectation. British crime drama at its best.This show is not too be missed, the viewer will not be disappointed.",2014
9,"I enjoyed Season 1 a good deal, but this new season is off the hook. The suspense, the tension, the unknowns (the answers to which are doled out at an agonizingly wonderful pace), the twists, the dialog, the acting. All of it has me on the edge of my seat each episode. Tremendous.",2017
9,"While sick I had time to binge both seasons, which is the best way to address episodic cliff-hangers. The series reminds me of The Killing, at least the first 'good' season which aired in the US. No huge actors, but great acting by all.",2017
7,"THE MISSING is a timely intervention, as its plot has strong echoes of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, the four-year-old who disappeared from a holiday apartment in Praia de Luz, a resort in the Algarve in 2007. Madeleine has still not been found, even after an extensive police search; but hitherto the search has led to speculation about the role of Madeleine""s parents in the affair, and whether or not they were involved in abducting her.",2014
9,"The Missing isn't going to be to everyone's taste, but if you like suspenseful character driven crime drama then i suggest you give it a try. The premise is simple.. a child is abducted surrounded by mystery, we see the aftermath and we see the obsession of a father who desperately needs closure, the timeline cuts back and forth from the time of the abduction to the present day.. something which is used to great effect to explain how each character got to the point they are now at. Some reviewers have suggested the pacing to be slow, but having watched the first 4 episodes now the pacing for me is well timed, we get some background information, we think we are getting a handle on some of the facts surrounding the case then as the tension builds we are knocked back from the edge of our seats with one swift body blow and our perceptions immediately change. The acting writing and direction for me have been very good. Nesbitt is always watchable. but he portrays Tony's pain and anguish very well indeed it is at times quite literally etched on his face, the supporting cast equally earn their dues. If you want a story that is wrapped up in 40 mins this isn't for you it's all about the journey and the final reveal i am sure will be well worth it.",2014
8,"Slow paced suspense drama based mostly around the time in days and years after the abduction of a young English boy in France, the parents are faced with the terror of the abduction and a police system which is different from their own in a language which is not their own. Lines can be drawn in a small way to a famous real life kidnapping of an English child overseas. I think that is where the similarity ends though. Elements of the drama seem a little far fetched but not beyond belief. I found its pace to be generally just enough to keep me engaged, yes is it slow and drawn out, like True Detective and The Fall and Top of the Lake. It doesn't make for a bad drama, I'm quite content that the grit of the story was more important than a fast paced US style drama. Unfortunately the ending was a bit clumsy and I think they left the door open for a 2nd series. This is probably a poor choice as the series sits better as a stand alone production. It is hard to see how a 2nd season could add realism.",2015
10,"Season 1 was excellent, but Season 2 blows it away. The suspenseful story line, coupled with great acting and direction, makes this eight episode season possibly the best thing I've ever seen on my television. If you haven't seen this, I recommend you go right to Season 2 as the only connection between that and Season 1 is the character Julien Baptiste.",2017
8,"I had heard nothing of this series. So gave it a go. I like Frances O'Connor so she drew me to it. It is a great series. Loved the character of Baptiste played so well by Tchéky Karyo. The attractive old man cop who is calm and intelligent. Just loved when he was on screen. Felt like when things went wrong, you'd shout 'tell Baptiste'.",2016
9,"I'm not a fan of dramatic family stories, whether or not based on true events, and definitely not when they are stretched to a long- running mini-series instead of a normal-length film feature. But when my wife said that she really wanted to follow this series when it aired on television, I didn't object at all and this initially because of (a) the involvement of some of the names in cast and crew and (b) because apparently the vast majority of the series – even though set in France – was filmed and produced in my native country Belgium. ""The Missing"" is directed by the Brit Tom Shankland, who made a couple of intriguing and semi-successful horror flicks (""The Children"", ""W Delta Z""), and stars a number of talented actors and actresses, like Tchéky Karyo (""Bad Boys"") and Jason Flemyng (""Snatch.""). It rarely ever happens that such an interesting bunch lands in Belgium, and it's even rarer that local TV-actors from this country (like Titus De Voogdt or Hilde Heijnen) receive the opportunity to co-star in such a prestigious and international production. The fantastic Belgian band Amatorski even had the chance to deliver the fantastic title song that'll remain stuck in your head and heart after each and every single episode (oh my love, I pray each day that you come home and be okay) ",2015
9,"First of all let me say that mystery crime are my favorite series. I like it when you have to try to figure out what's going on or who's the villain. And this show is a really good one in his genre. Every episode ends with a cliffhanger and makes you wanting to see the rest as soon as possible. I saw the whole eight episodes in two days, that's how much I loved it. The actors are all very good even though they might not be well known by a lot of people. Being from Belgium, to me it was even more interesting when I discovered places I knew because they filmed a lot of the scenes only like 20 kilometers from where I live. Also the mix of French and English worked really well for me because it are two of the three languages that I speak daily. To me The Missing is on the same level as The Killing. Every episode you think you figured it out or at least you think you know who did it or what happened and then it goes in a complete other direction. I figured out one part of the mystery but the other part I didn't see coming and that's what I love about this kind of show. Top show to watch!",2015
6,"It seems that in most cases 8 episodes of any thriller (True Detective and danish Killing were exceptions) is just too much, 6 episodes seems to perfect. First four episodes were good and interesting, but after that the story started dragging.",2014
3,"Parts of the show are good but other bits are just irritating. The plot is constantly shifting back and forward in time and by the time you've figured out which time frame you're in you end up losing the plot. Subtitles are used only some of the time which is extremely irritating. Characters do things which defy belief. At one point James Nesbitt's character beats up a paedophile after finding a known contact on his phone who he believes is involved in taking his son but doesn't think to take the phone as evidence. Why not, it's beyond belief ! On another occasion police say they cannot open the case again on the basis of the boy's top possibly being in a house basement but doesn't think to mention about his son's drawing being found on the wall of the room ?? The plot is painfully slow but you do want to watch it to the end to find out what happens. It's a bit like a book that starts off good, but about a third the way through you feel like giving up as it's not so well written but you still read to the end just to see the outcome.",2014
10,I just finished watching The Missing as a free viewing for Starz. Nesbit (lead role as the father) and all cast are on their game. These directors also really have taken time with their craft. It's an edge of your seat suspense. There is something about people from the UK that just get good drama. It's so believable and emotional. I'm signing up for Starz today just for this show. The thing I liked about this premiere the most was that it had no inkling of Hollywood around it. I consider myself a movie snob and this one makes my cut.,2014
10,This is a review for the first season of this show.,2017
9,People go on about US drama but whilst some is very good some is utter dross.,2016
9,This new BBC mystery series is awesome. The main plot resolves around the story about a missing child of a British couple in a small village in France. It happens in 1998 after they unexpectedly take a detour from there vacation due to car problems. During the world cup final at a crowded bar somehow the boy vanishes. The characters are superb and connected in many different ways also nothing is the way it first seems. And almost everyone is burdened by guilt and doubt. ,2014
10,"I became completely obsessed with The Missing series. I couldn't wait for the week to pass, so I could see another episode. I always came away feeling depressed for the parents, but couldn't take my eyes away. I really identified with the characters and thought about them during the week!! Luckily, for some reason, Comcast showed the episodes one week in advance every Saturday morning, for some reason. This story was amazing, in my view and the raw emotional content was brilliant. Not many TV series equal The Missing. Fantastic production. I especially loved the actor who played the father. He should have gotten an award for his performance. The first season of The Killing was another of my favorites. I rarely take the time to submit ratings, but this series really captivated my imagination. Still waiting for another series to take its place. My excellent rating is completely unsolicited.",2016
3,"I was so keen to watch this after it was all over the papers. I found James Nesbit to be so very annoying. He cannot act and had only about 2 facial expressions, one to look mean and another to look annoyed both of them irritating. His wife in the show was great and I enjoyed her performances. The whole thing was overlong, lot a of stuff that was not needed and wasn't relevant to the plot. Also why was he allowed to follow the investigator around & interview people?? Was I the only one who was also annoyed at the ending.I am wondering to myself why I bothered watching it all now when all it did was annoy me.",2015
10,"I am not going to go into the details about the plot but suffice it to say that it is one of the best TV series in a very long time. Unlike most crime TV series coming from Hollywood, this one is far more realistic. It does not center around some remarkable detectives whose unorthodox methods help them solve all cases, even when there is no physical evidence present at the crime scene. ",2015
1,"I like the idea of this show. I think that it's adorable. But after watching this show, I am greatly disappointed.",2016
2,"I absolutely hate this show. It's a cute concept, but growing up with boy meets world was completely different. Disney did not do a good job reinventing the show. What I loved about boy meets world was that it was real, it was similar to what someone was going through.at the end of the episode still taught a lesson. Girl meets world is nothing like that. this ""remake"" is overly dramatic for my taste. No teen deals with things in the manner they place them in the show. It's not realistically relatable and there's a lot of dry tasteless humor and the whole show is confusing, it's like watching a novella. I think the only thing I like about it is seeing all the original characters once again.",2016
10,"I grew up on Boy Meets World. I tuned in to ABC every week to see what was new with Cory, Shawn, Topanga, Eric, and the rest of the gang, and I still watch it on ABC Family. Since finding out about the reboot of the show through Girl Meets World, I knew it could go one of two ways. 1. It will be down-right awful. Sure, sometimes BMW could get a little cheesy, but this is Disney, it could be cheesy to the 100th power. It could be over-acted, pay no homage to all that made BMW great, be poorly written, and just be ridiculous... ORRRRRRR 2. It will be awesome. It will draw older viewers (who may now be parents of the show's target audience) in with the nostalgia of BMW, not only with cameos of stars from the original series, but also through plot lines, quotes, and details that any BMW fan would instantly grasp. It will be appropriately acted, and well written.",2014
4,I think this show could be good. And its honestly fun to watch but its so staged for a show that's kinda like a person going head on with life. The acting is terrible but some of the story line i like. I'm 13 years old and i feel like they should add more of what a real teen is like. And what they are going through. But i do enjoy watching it because its actually quite emotionally sometimes. :) I like when they talk about the environment.Or how they go through hard times but they are always find a way through.This show is very accurate to a teens life though so i do like that. (sorry for the terrible way i explained it I tried my best.),2016
10,"Finally! A Disney show that doesn't completely suck! Girl Meets World might not be everything Boy Meets World fans were hoping for, but it certainly isn't too disappointing. The two main friends are basically female versions of Shawn and Cory, which is awesome. We also have adult versions of Shawn and Topanga as the parents, which definitely makes the show worth watching. For kids growing up today who missed out on Boy Meets World, I think this ""reboot"" will more than make up for that loss. It's got great writing, a good cast of child actors (after all, it's pretty hard to find amazing child actors), and an enjoyable atmosphere. It will be interesting to see what sort of life lessons this show instills on today's kids, and how they compare to the many lessons Boy Meets World taught us growing up. I for one am excited to see where this goes. ",2014
6,"While Boy Meets World targeted pre-teens to adults, Girl Meets World is strictly for the pre-teens to teen age bracket. With silly story lines, Girl Meets World is much more like a Hannah Montana, ICarly, or Wizards of Waverly, than it is to the original Boy Meets World. While the format of learning a life lesson is still there, it is found in a much sillier way. ",2014
10,"I'm a fan of just about all the shows on Disney Channel but this is hands down my favorite! Spin-offs are always risky, but GMW has it all! Great story line, great actors and you walk away from every show with a ""life lesson"". I don't care if I am 38, this is one of the best family shows on TV. :) Disney shows remind me of the TV shows I used to watch when I was younger. Growing Pains, Who's the Boss?, Boy Meets World, Family Ties, Head of the Class, Blossom, etc. They were all funny and hokey and Disney has recaptured it with their shows. A good TV show doesn't have to have cursing and half naked individuals to be ""good"". The values that GMW and other Disney shows portray are everything we're lacking in regular prime time television.",2014
4,"As an fan of the original Boy Meets World, Girl Meets World was definitely something I was excited for. Once I saw that it was a Disney show, I became hesitant, but still entered with an open mind. The first thing you notice is the return of Topanga and Cory Matthews. And that's essentially the only good part of the show. The problem with GMW is mainly that started on Disney, which meant the show had to start with bad actors, bad plot, horrible scripts and cheesy morals. Even Danielle Fishel and Ben Savage (Topanga and Cory) who were great actors in the original show, have become silhouettes of those original characters, with extreme overacting and characters that simply aren't believable. Now, onto the main characters; First, there's the MAIN character and daughter of Cory and Topanga, Riley. To be blunt, she is a horrible character and actor. She seems to have no experience and is another shining example of over acting. The charm of Cory from BMW was that he was a good seed who often got in to trouble, and the lessons came from that. The problem with Riley is that her character is a ""Beacon Of Perfection"". There is never any trouble to be had for her, which means all of the morals have to come from other, rather unimportant things. Like the intense conundrum of ""Are we dating?"". One thing that comes with the GMW's Disney logo, is the restraint of serious topics. Such as in the original BMW, the episode ""Wake Up, Little Cory"" which focused on the kids ideas of sex and love. When events transpire and people think Cory slept with Topanga, the real lessons come out. Whereas, because GMW is featured on Disney, this show will never see anything even close to those topics, which really restrains the show. Now, back to the characters. Riley's best friend, Maya is probably the best character on the show. She is there to fulfill the role of Shaun from BMW, but she is nowhere near the same levels of depth that Shaun had. Maya is the most mature character on the show, but she still doesn't go around blowing things up with Cherry Bombs or going on strike in school like Shaun did. She's still a pretty clean character. Then, there's Farkle. He really serves no purpose. He's not the super smart outcast like his father Stuart used to be. He's actually a relatively creepy character. He's constantly taking hits at his female friends, trying to get a date out of them. And I mean constantly. He's just weird. And then we have Lucas, Riley's crush and one of the worst characters on the show. He's flat, shows no emotion ever, definitely can't act and is only there to be the crush/boyfriend character. The only characters that are actually important are Riley and Maya, and you don't even care for them. Whereas, in BMW, you cared for pretty much everyone in Cory's ""group"". ",2015
5,"I highly anticipated this show, thinking it would reflect the heartfelt, fun, and thoroughly enjoyable Boy Meets World. To my dismay, this show is nothing like BMW. It is laced with the same immature comedy, shallow emotions, poor attempts at touching moments, and un-relatable characters of most other Disney shows of this generation. Riley (Rowan Blanchard) is portrayed as the over- exaggerated, bland, and obnoxious daughter of Corey and Topanga. She lacks any depth as a character - nothing like Corey's character in BMW. She is not likable at all. Her best friend Maya (Sabrina Carpenter) is the ""Shawn"" of the show, and is a little bit better but still lacks any real character depth or development. Girl Meets World attempts to steal similar story arcs from BMW, but fails at them miserably - the girl who is ""coming of age"" and learning about life, with the ""troubled"" best friend who needs guidance because her parents border on neglect; the teacher who is more than a teacher, but who becomes more involved in the students' lives and teaches (or attempts to teach) real life lessons. This would have been okay, if the writers had done a better job of recreating these arcs. But Maya's story is nothing like Shawn's in terms of believe-ability and demonstrates none of the real emotional turmoil that accompanies these situations, something which was portrayed flawlessly in BMW. I could go on and on about what BMW had that GMW attempts to have but falls short. Even the most frivolous and comedic episodes of BMW contained more depth and truly touching moments that the watcher felt to their core, than the most mature and serious episodes of GMW. Overall, GMW attempts to be the BMW of the generation, but ends up feeling shallow, rushed, and immature. ",2015
6,"I had watched the original Boy Meets World from the first time Topanga (Danielle Fishel) drew on her face to when the new Matthews clan was winging their way to New York with a new baby. So, when I heard they were producing a sequel series following said baby, I knew I had to check it out.",2015
4,"I'm giving it a minimum of four for Topanga and Cory alone. Weaving ""Lisa"" from ""Sister, Sister"" into the first episode was also a nice touch (especially for the older fans). The acting on the show however, is poor and cliché. The characters have little to no personality and are over-scripted (as expected with modern Disney shows). Absolutely vapid writing. Had potential if they gave it substance. A real shame. Has some valid humor to it but those moments are few and far between. Would not recommend it if you're hoping it will be similar to Boy Meets World. Would recommend it for toddlers though or a maximum of age 8 or MAYBE 9. You have to remember, back when Boy Meets World came out, their target audience was set for 8-17 (roughly). This would be difficult to sit through for anyone above 9 ,as the target audience for this show and modern Disney in general is clearly set low in age.",2015
8,"Just watched the pilot and am excited for the rest of the season. Huge fan of Boy Meets World, so I was super excited for this. But I also tried to keep my expectations in check - it's its own show, the 1st season of BMW was fairly cheesy, etc. Well, I really liked it. ",2014
3,"Yeah, the acting is mostly wooden, but what really kills this show is the script. It seems that the kids do nothing but sit around and deliver to each other unbearably long and preachy moralizing lectures. I can't imagine anybody, whether you are an adult or a 13-year-old girl, actually enjoying watching THIS. It feels like the script has been written by a committee of lawyers and PR experts, not by actual writers. Disney shows are supposed to be sanitized and maximally inoffensive, but any semblance of real life has been so completely sucked out of this show, there is literally nothing left to watch here.",2016
1,"THIS IS HORRIBLE. I hate the new Girl Meets World its extremely corny, unfunny, and very disappointing and god awful. I used to watch Boy Meets World on Abc and absolutely loved it, I used to really enjoy the old humor they had back then, it was a bit foul with its language and the jokes were more mature but that is what made it amazing and great to watch, but of course I guess its because Disney transformed it into a corny, and cliché sitcom. I really hope this wont last another season. The characters act poorly and I hate how Topanga has barely any time on the show. All I want is the old Boy Meets world back not this terrible show.",2014
1,"I'm proud to say that I'm a True Boy Meets World Fan! That show has been, and ALWAYS will be one of my favorites. I learned a lot from that show, and it was Beyond Funny! I have Every Season! And I'm re-watching them all one by one. Then comes along this piece of TRASH. Not only is this show absolute trash... it's NOT Funny! It's NOT Realistic! (In some scenarios maybe, but not all), it's Extremely Feminist towards Men! I can keep going on. I have nothing against Danielle at all playing Topanga, I really don't, but I'm disgusted that her character is NOTHING like her character on BMW. Not only that... but the chemistry between her and Corey throughout the show.... just Awful. Not only that... but Corey is being talked down to constantly by his own wife and daughter multiple times... I felt so bad for Ben Savage as an Actor. Speaking of Actors... Ben as Corey... did Amazing! Ryder as Shawn... Excellent! William as Eric... Wonderful! And who can forget... FEENAY! Absolutely Legendary! Danielle did a great job I will admit... but I can't say that her character is this MISTAKE of a show did any good. There are life lessons sure... but A LOT are NOT realistic solutions in the real world, and I feel so bad for this year's generation of kids watching this show. Only because while they're learning from absolutely cheesy and corny solutions from this show... it is NOT teaching them FULLY about how the real world is. Like I said before, sometimes there are good life lessons learned here... but I highly suggest they learn these at home, or in the REAL WORLD so they're not being led to FAKE SOLUTIONS. Parents! Do yourself a favor! If this show is on TV... switch the channel! Or better yet... buy the DVD Box Sets of Boy Meets World! Your children will learn much more from that show... I promise.",2017
6,"I'm 36 and honestly I watch GMW and be so confused. The discussions and relationships are so deep I wonder how kids relate. Some episodes I be left wondering WTF were they talking about and they always talk in 3rd person. Also arguments or disagreements be real out of teenage like scenarios.. That's my opinion. I'll continue to watch as I have been my entire life. But can this show be less confusing or am I too old to understand? lol? I get excited when old cast especially Sean be in the episode, if I'm not mistaken everyone including Angela has made an appearance, which makes it feel more boy meets worldish. Still great show I just can't relate like i did when I was in high school watching the old one. #I'm so old. Lol",2016
2,"I was really excited to see this show at first, as I'm a huge fan of Boy Meets World. Since the first season is now over, I have to say that I really didn't like it. ",2015
1,"(I have to add this line here in order to post this review because apparently you need at least 10 lines for a proper review? What the fudge? Oh, and you can't curse or use capital letter/exclamation points because that would be shouting?)",2014
6,"Personally, I think this show is a fine spin off from Boy Meets World. It gives myself some sort of closure by revealing how everyone in BMW has been doing so far. I am glad to find out that Cory and Topanga are happily marriage.",2015

3,"I'm not even quite sure where to begin with this movie. I mean, I had decent hopes for it. Leading up to it, so many people seemed to be taking it way to seriously. I mean, come on. Its about giant talking turtles who fight crime. Its not supposed to be that serious. Hoo, boy.",2014
3,"Folks, it's no exaggeration when I say this one is bad. And I'm not just reviewing it as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. The Ninja Turtles are a lore. Every telling of the story deserves its own version, like Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, or Batman. Adam West, Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck all play different versions of Batman in different universes. Though I have a version of the Turtles I like best, I can set aside that prejudice for this review. It's just a very awful film. It's so bad, I don't understand how the current rating stands at 6 stars.",2014
5,"Like many other people, the original 1990 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie has a very special place in my childhood. Even if the movie wasn't all that great, it was fantastic for what it was trying to be. Now we're in 2014, where our beloved turtles have been given a whole new lick of paint with a straight-up reboot and have the daunting task of winning the long time TMNT faithful over. Needless to say that for the most part, I am one fan that was not entirely won over.",2014
6,Here we go,2014
1,"So I browsed some IMDb user reviews before watching this movie and amazed by a quantity of 1-star ratings, I thought, come on its just a TMNT movie, it cant be that bad, right? But it turns out that its even worse than 1 star...",2015
1,"As with most redoes, the original is so much better. The ""Turtles"" of the 90's relied heavily on snarky one-liners; likable characters and some really good humor. This move effectively discards all aforementioned attributes and glues its storyline to over-the-top CGI (typical), oh-so-very-special effects and poor lighting. Oh, and the powers-to-be smacked this chelonian trio with the un-funny stick so hard, I suggest discarding any plans for sequels. I did watch this movie and felt overwhelmed by the hum-drum boredom spewing from the screen. At first I thought all would be saved when April O'Neil entered. At least in the original, that's what happened when Judith Hoag's strong personality came on scene. Hoag's April successfully bridged the gap between real-world and sewer world, and further strengthened the brotherly bond of the turtles. I'm sorry, but Megan Fox just seemed wrong for the part. She is a very pretty woman, but she was not the right fit. I must be fare and say that it is not all her fault. These personalities of these turtles seemed much more superficial than the ones in the earlier movie(s), and that might have made her job more difficult. Anyways, like 'The Green Hornet', 'The Green Lantern', and - even 'Superman', I am over redoes. I will not watch the sequel and will try to erase this fail from my memory.",2014
1,All I can say is thank God I was given a free ticket to see this garbage as I can't understand why anyone would want to spend money to sit through this. This whole movie was just drivel from beginning to end and I can guarantee that there is are better ways to waste 100 minutes of your life. ,2014
1,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been around for many years and many kids have enjoyed it very much. Those children must be severely disappointed with this horrifying display of a once semi-interesting story line. Honestly, the new animated TMNT Nickelodeon TV show is better than this movie, and that show has some very questionable and disturbing things. For one thing, what kind of writer has plot changing scenes that are all based on conveniently placed objects or stupidity of characters? I mean really, the rat conveniently discovers an advanced ninjitsu book in a sewer? What did Jackie Chan drop his hand book last time he wrestled a crocodile? And what kind of evil mastermind, who doesn't want anything getting in his way and wants all the turtles dead, would settle for a simple ""yeah, that turtle is dead"" and not even attempt to be completely certain and just basically is completely okay with that? Not only are the fight scenes terribly disappointing and short, but the jokes aren't even laugh worthy. While sitting in the theater, not even a pity laugh was uttered after the failed attempt at humor. If there is one thing TMNT is known for, it's the humor, specifically Michelangelo's jokes. It's really pathetic when the only jokes the, theoretically, funniest character can come up with are potty humor and stupidity. Nickelodeon is more clever than that, and they didn't even have as much money on the line. Yeah, the box office results for TMNT are huge, but just think about it. Box office results tell you how many people went to see the movie, not how many people actually liked the movie walking away from it. It makes you ashamed to have participated in the box office results that are leading more people to waste their money on this movie. So, basically, if you are a TMNT fan from childhood, don't waste your time if you haven't already made that mistake. And don't fool yourself into believing it's a good movie simply because you hoped it would. I would say, don't waste your time or money. I'm sorry for those of you who actually liked this movie. It is just simply disappointing, and I guess an opinion is an opinion. I just hope that you won't have to walk away wishing you hadn't walked in in the first place.",2014
1,"Story, presentation, originality, humor, character presentation and acting are all things obviously left unexplored in this epically abysmal 2014 installation of the turtles franchise. ",2014
6,"I cannot take it anymore. No, I'm not referring to Michael Bay. I have no issues with him. He was nothing but a co-producer. What I can't take is how lovers of this movie can't see what was wrong with it. I'm a long time turtles fan. Born in the 80s, grew up on the TV show, seen all movies and series, and had many action-figures. This movie was disappointing. I'm not saying it's terrible and normally I don't really agree with critics, but this time, I'm inclined to. It simply wasn't that great. Here are the reasons why: ",2014
6,Now before I begin this review let me clear the fact that this MOVIE is aiming for the new younger audience. This movie is not focusing on aiming for the fans of the past generation. So lets look at it this way.,2014
10,"Rather childish but will appeal to young audiences. Children 17 or below will absolutely love it. The plot is really nice. It has a lot of inflated action scenes which reminded me of the Transformers movies. They obviously spent a lot of money making this movie. It doesn't deviate much from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles story. It contains all the main characters including Splinter, Shredder and April O'Neil. It also presents us a background story with an explanation as to how the mutant turtles were created. It doesn't promise more than what it delivers. A very entertaining but rather lengthy movie with a few funny scenes. They made sure through those funny scenes that we understand those turtles are young teenagers. I definitely recommend it to any parent who wants to take his or her kids to see a movie. I give it a full 10.",2014
1,The good news is that this is better than the last turtles movie. The bad news is the last turtles movie was horrendous. The title should tell it all. I really don't understand how certain people retain their jobs in Hollywood. The only reason this movie is afloat is due to legacy. It could have been written by kindergartners and it would have performed just as well. Might as well let someone new have a shot instead of paying these idiots for doing average or below work.,2014
2,"After years of trying to bring this franchise back to the big screen, Michael Bay and his company, Platinum Dunes was able to do it. Sadly, the effort was just as sad most of the recent Michael Bay films. Without Bay behind the camera on this project, we are left with an even worse story(if that is possible), and just awful action. This is my review of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",2014
10,This movie was amazing!,2014
1,"This movie was just horrible, it had absolutely nothing to do with the original story and plot of the TMNT. Splinter and the turtles were April's pets? And instead of Splinter being the rat of his master in the foot clan mimicking his movements he learns from a book he finds in the sewer. Megan Fox is also just a horrible actress who happens to be the absolute most unqualified person to be playing the role of April O'neil. If Megan Fox was not in the movie it would be slightly more tolerable, still a horrible movie. Michael Bay proves to have no creativity and no imagination as this movie looks and feels like his just as crappy Transformers movies. It has the same dark look as the transformers. The movie had 1 or 2 fun/cool parts but it isn't worth watching the whole movie just for those parts. Shredders suit is also way overboard and entirely made out of metal. The TMNT live action movies from the 90's seems to be the only good movies considering how awful this movie is, I cannot express how awful this movie is.",2014
2,"Before I begin this, I want to say I'm not exactly the biggest TMNT fan out there. Having said that though, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is so bad that it'll probably make any fan, whether they be casual(like me) or a die hard fan. When trailers of the film first came out, I thought it looked like the new Transformers movie. But when I finished seeing it, and noticing Michael Bay was behind it, I had a bad feeling about it.",2014
1,"Going into watching the newest TMNT I wasn't expecting an emotional, complex character driven film.. having said that I was hoping for more than another unwatchable Michael Bay movie. Unfortunately by the end of the film it was too late and I realized I had just wasted nearly two hours of my life and was left feeling a little bit more dead inside.. With annoying voice acting, horrible CG and some of the worst ""acting"" by one particular character the entire movie seemed as though it wanted me to turn it off and throw the disc out the window.. The only slightly redeemable quality of the film came in the form of Will Arnett and his awkwardly funny yet underutilized character.",2014
3,"Personally like the Turtles they are strong and there costumes are absolutely phenomenal even though people don't like them. But I see them as the only authentic thing in the movie and also the only thing that took time to be created.But as for the Girl who is supposedly the main character i think she needs to be given a common sense or killed in the second movie. That girl is a pain in the lower part of the back. trust me if the second installment is to be hailed as a great movie .That chick must die or become mute,which ever one gets her to shut her trap.Cause seriously her random screaming ain't workings for me.I give this movie a 3.for the Turtles and of course their swag.",2015
1,"The turtles are called upon to fight a man who wants to take over the city. He is a rich man planning a dastardly deed so he can become... rich. That is just a taster of the complete dog's breakfast that they made of the narrative in this cynical, loud, disjointed, unfunny, insincere waste of time. It's winter, there is snow on the ground, but Megan Fox runs about in a tight t-shirt and short jacket so the lads can constantly ogle her assets. They blow up a lot of stuff, the camera shakes like hell, there seems to be fighting going on, there are well-worn jokes - ""That went well"" - and the two funny bits are in the trailer. Park your brain outside. And bring earplugs.",2015
1,"Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself. He took so many 90's childhood heroes and forever tarnished their GREAT reputation. This movie was a half fast piece of crap. The title should be APRIL O'NEIL:New York News Reporter. The script, graphics, and plot line were ALL terrible. Seriously now the turtles were April O'Neil's pets? Just because you waste a bunch of $ on a gorgeous, but horrible, actress doesn't mean the movie needs to revolve around her. It's TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, not APRIL O'NEIL and the ninja turtles. Nickelodeon should immediately sell the rights of the ninja turtles back to Kevin Laird and Peter Eastman so they can make a better movie, even if it is just a 30 minute cartoon episode, I will be more entertained and more impressed. Oh and Dear Michael Bay, NO ONE CARES IF STUFF BLOWS UP!!!! WE'VE ALL SEEN IT BEFORE!!! ",2015
1,"Jonathan Liebesman, Michael Bay, Josh Appelbaum, and anyone else involved in the casting, writing, production, or direction of the film should be beaten with their choice of a sword, a bo staff, sais, and nunchakus. I didn't think it was possible to ruin a franchise more thoroughly and absolutely than they did. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The concept of the movie was a complete and total failure. From the introduction sequence of the film to the look and origin of the turtles and Splinter to the overall storyline to how April O'Neil's character would be integrated to the absence of other key characters (Casey Jones anyone?) to how the conflict would be established to the decision to show Shredder's face and eliminate part of the mystery behind his character... it was all bad. I would assume that after they had the preliminary blueprint for the film, they would begin the writing process. Oh man, the writing was terrible! The dialogue felt forced and disingenuous and the script made it just about impossible for any cast to save the film. The characters are not developed at all and the plot is developed even less. How about the casting decisions? Megan Fox? Really? What about Megan Fox screams April O'Neil? Nothing, that's what. Why not go for Emma Stone, Amy Adams, Isla Fisher, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone, Karen Gillan, or Rachel Nichols to play everyone's favorite redheaded reporter? Any of them could've provided the appropriate overall look for the character and they all would have their own unique spin on the feel. Whether it be sense of humor, acting style, sensuality, etc. What they all have in common is that they all would've been a better choice than Megan Fox. Oh, and did I mention Emma Stone? Because why bother going after the one actress every single TMNT fan wanted to see in the movie when you can land a brunette with too much plastic surgery and not enough acting chops. Yeah, that makes sense. The casting decisions for the turtles was nearly as bad. Outside of Alan Ritchson (Raphael), none of the other turtles even remotely sounded like their characters and the casting of Johnny Knoxville as Leonardo may have been the worst decision of them all. So now we have a mediocre script and cast, maybe the cinematography and special effects will be good, right? Ha! That's funny. No, instead we got a combination of some of the worst shaky cam, cgi, and overall cinematography I've ever seen. Honestly, it feels almost as if some idiot studio exec gave $125 to some bums off of the street and told them to reboot this beloved franchise. Actually, no, I think they would've done a better job.",2015
1,"OK. I honestly do not know how there's people on this planet that are granted huge amounts of cash to produce something like this. I mean, sure the production is fine. But why is it, they always have to mess with the story lines. Same with Transformers, same with X- men, same with all nostalgia we grew up with.",2015
10,"This is my first review here so bear with me. As I'm sure most of you know, this movie is based on a novel Where rainbows end by Cecilia Ahern. It is just loosely based on it, because the story differs somewhat. I won't reveal anything else, to avoid spoilers. All I'll say is that it works because it captures the essence of the book. The chemistry between the two main actors is unbelievably good and the supporting cast is good as well. I warmly recommend this film to everybody. How probable the plot, that is up to a viewer to decide. It was for me. If you're a hopeless romantic, you're gonna enjoy this one. If you're a realist, you're probably gonna find certain situations a bit too much and out there. Nonetheless I left the theater with a smile on my face. The movie makes you believe that anything is possible and that one should never give up on hope.",2014
7,"Based on the 2004 romance novel 'Where Rainbows End' written by Cecilia Ahern, Love, Rosie is about a story of two people who were best friends since they were young. They've known each other for so long and they're absolutely meant for each other, but could never have the courage to admit that they have strong feelings for each other. Furthermore, life is not always how we expect or want it to be, as various unforeseen circumstances or misunderstandings continuously keeps them apart from each other.",2014
9,"As a fan of the original book ""Where Rainbows End"", I had been kind of disappointed when people told me that there are many differences between the novel and its adaption on the big screen. However, I changed my prejudice when I finally saw it myself. The movie is romantic, with beautiful-filmed scenes (I love the color throughout the whole movie), and moving. The music sounds good (gotta buy the soundtrack!) too. And I love Lily and Sam Claflin as Rosie and Alex, as you can really feel the chemistry between them from the very first minutes of the film. Perfect casting :) I don't care about how unreal the plot is. It just feels good watching a slice-of-life movie like this once in a while.",2015
6,"Romance novelist Cecilia Ahern made a bit of a splash in chick-lit circles when her second novel, Where Rainbows End, was published in 2004. It was a tale of two people who were clearly perfect for each other but could never seem to find their way towards being in love, told in the form of e-mails, text messages and letters. The story itself was predictable, but the format was reasonably hip and refreshing at the time. Ten years later, the book has been turned into a slight but amiable romantic comedy for the silver screen. The film isn't particularly hip or refreshing, but boasts just enough charm and emotion to entertain - even if it isn't a film that will stay with you for long afterwards.",2014
3,"Sam Claflin and Lily Collins play Alex and Rosie, whom we watch grow from childhood friends to awkward adults, separated by sea but bound by heart. Bless. No contrivance is left uncontrived to keep them apart. Bad relationships. Babies. Even worse relationships. It's life, Jim, but not as we know it. Fans of the book may be dismayed to learn that the film deviates from the text in the final act – although by then they might actually be glad we're not going the whole hog.",2014
10,"I do not usually write reviews but these hating reviews got me into that :D I don't get all the people complaining about how predictable this movie was. God damn it if you want some unpredictable ending go watch ""shutter island"" or ""mulholland drive"" or something that SAYS that it is a freaking THRILLER!!. This movie is a ""Romantic Comedy"" and it is just like ""Pretty Woman"", ""10 Things I hate about you"" or ""say anything"" - The movies we loved, even if they were predictable. The point is, its not about the ending, its about living in between the movie; desperately wanting for them to recognize love and chanting for there friendship and adoring their silly fights and commitments.

5,"The supporting cast is a jumble of ham-heads, over playing vileness just to hammer home the point that the protagonists love is meant to come to fruition. This point alone underscores the absolute naff unbelievable absurdity of this trashy little film. That said - as way of consolation - the main actors pull off their toffy anguished tormented soul routines to at least the low standard Hollywood has set for romantic comedies; they are both watchable. The adaptation was worthy of the book, but that wasn't very hard now, was it? ",2015
8,"Rosie and Alex have been best friends since primary school. They nearly got romantic on Rosie's 18th birthday, but Rosie was way too drunk. Since then, both have had relationships, just not with each other - timing has always worked against them.",2014

The whole movie is dedicated solely to launch there actors careers/not about the actual plot? Check.,2015

Best friends, girl and boy since the age of 5, girl gets pregnant by an irresponsible guy who runs off, the original male friend goes to NY and hooks up with a hot model wife ... I just don't want to even think about it. It makes light of failed young relationships where a kid is involved and that true love cannot be found with a hot wife in Manhattan with a great job and materialistic life style, instead dreary England with a hot but not as hot girl who has a child by another man is a better option. I think I'd choose the emotionally challenged hot wife in Manhattan thank you very much. It's unconvincing, it's unrealistic, people are not willing to sacrifice what they have for a person with baggage across the Atlantic. The single parent girl in England even accepts the bum dad that abandoned his child in the first place and gets burnt, so the girl in England is portrayed as stupid and irresponsible also. There's even the inevitable rush at the end as the person whose made a series of relationship mistakes runs to what she believes to be the true love of her life and vice versa, that good old Rom Com cliché I just hate this movie, I want my electricity paid for which I spent on the TV watching this drivel, I want my 110 minutes or so back where I could have been asleep instead....",2016

Rosie and Alex missed so many chances ( as it happens in life) and they finally had courage to be together in their 50's... And yes- that was the very happy moment for me as a reader and I almost jumped when they finally got together...But the movie didn't gave me that jump...

1,"Somehow i made it to the end of this movie in spite of questioning myself the whole way through as to why I was giving it my time. I think this has more to do with my inability to stop something half-way through or perhaps my willing it to get better & leave me feeling at least somewhat satisfied. Not. This. Film. They were so busy squeezing in the many missed opportunities the leads had of getting together that they forgot to give them personalities or anything for the audience to care about! The script was weak at best (& at times simply confusing in its empty/fast-forwarded-ness), the acting was mostly unconvincing & the characters so badly stereotyped that they couldn't have any credence at all. Add this to some been there, done that, attempts at comedic moments & you have a deeply vapid experience that laughs at the audience for staying the course. As you can tell, i found nothing redeeming in this movie at all & cannot understand why it has 7 stars. There was nothing new or clever or interesting or emotive in this film...so what's the point?",2015
7,"I think this movie is really nice, i mean amazing. Why? I think so because it was full of nice jokes, yes i laughed on them. The actors were brilliant, like they made you believe in them. Also, the story is pretty nice and the directing is also nice. The Soundtrack is also good. Well, in general the movie was full of suspense, it's like you think that this thing gonna happen and you found the opposite thing happening. It's also full of new actions,in a very fast way that you won't get bored while watching the movie. Well, the end made the movie simply perfect,while watching it, i expected Alex and Rosie, together but not that way. Finally, let me just, this Romantic Comedy is Amazing and really entertaining",2014

1,Life is too short to waste on awful films.,2015
10,"Better without the trite and predictive plot. After seeing the cover photo for the movie, I thought I knew how it was all going to end. But after 20 minutes and all the twists and turns, I realize my assumptions were all wrong and didn't know HOW this movie was going to reach its denouement. ",2016
8,"A clichéd rom-com. Shocker. For all those reviewers out there saying that this is a bad film because it's predictable, I'd like you to point me to one that's not. Yes, you can see the ending coming from a mile off but that's really not the point, because if you go to see a romantic comedy for a twist ending then you really shouldn't be watching these kinds of films. This was refreshingly English, with two brilliant leads in Collins and Claflin, who had great chemistry on screen and were very much believable as almost lovers. It was a really touching story as well, and it was nice to see a film about two nice people who were incredibly selfless - I saw someone complain about how many times other things got in the way. This was because the other things getting in the way were what the two characters thought was best for the other, they just wanted each other to be happy, no matter what else was going on around them. Yes, the plot was a little bit all over the place and some of the time jumps felt unnecessary, but it was hardly a deal breaker, in some ways complimenting the hectic nature of these star-crossed lovers' lives. A lovely film that really warms you up inside, and well worth the watch if you enjoy rom-coms, although it's unlikely to sway any non-believers in the genre.",2014
5,"good Rom-Com in general, Honestly though, i was always in love with Lily Collins she's a babe .. what a beauty :D ,, The casting was successful.",2015
3,I've never read the book that it's based on but after seeing this movie I feel even less motivated to read it.,2015
4,"Rom-coms are a special type of movies. In some aspects they are equivalent to a junk food - something that's your guilty pleasure, that you know is way beyond your usual type of movies, but you just want a quick fix of dopamine and you go with it. And just like with the junk food, the ingredients always tend to be the same - people come for their favorite snack because they know what to expect. But just like when Coca Cola tried to introduce its new taste to the general public, these things usually backfire. So you either need to stick to the well known or try to be completely original, but you can never go half way. And this is what we see in this movie. They try to be unpredictable by putting in so many twist that an average soap opera wold be proud of it. Yet all this twists seem so predictable that you have to ask yourself - ""why bother?"". In the end you get something that neither smells nor stinks, and that's never a good thing.",2016
5,"Love, Rosie is your run of the mill rom drama. Yes, drama. Only those with a particularly perverse sense of humor can truly label this a romcom. A few sporadic laughs a comedy do not make, my friend. So, watcher, be forewarned. Expect drama bordering on melodrama and only then might you like it. Otherwise, you'll be staring at the screen wondering where your comic relief for the night went... and that's straight out the window, I'm afraid. It's almost two hours of psychological torture when you're expecting the mood to lighten up and it never does. IMDb needs to get its category labeling in order. Anyway, the movie itself isn't half bad. The acting is believable, the story's engaging. It's just not a comedy. So know what you're getting into. I wish someone told me that.",2015
10,"Okay, first of all, let me address the 1-star crowd. Yes, it's a musical. How could you not know that it was...this musical's been around for nearly THIRTY YEARS NOW! Ahem. Okay, yes, it has dark elements, including references to pedophilia. THIS WAS IN THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL! In fact, Disney toned it down severely! Horrible score? Tell that to Sondheim - he wrote the pieces (and won awards for them)...sigh. Some people just don't ""get it"".",2015
1,"For those who liked the play save your money and go see the play. This film was a poor adaptation with maddening unsympathetic characters. The extreme efforts and great acting of individuals could not make up for the horrible script, pedophilia and rape undertones, and horrible moral guidance. The songs are all sung in the near same tone and were poorly integrated with the action. This is the first film in 30 years I've wanted to throw my drink at, yell boo, and leave. I gutted out the last of the film to give an honest review. The film was so horrible it motivated me to open an account and review it. The premise was interesting and brought me in. The cast kept me sitting, hoping it got better. I can't get that time back. A very poor film for children, annoying and maddening for adults. With plot holes and inexplicable insertions. The cast tried their hardest and individually acted well but the film direction, production, script, and song lyrics made for a horrible product. The visuals were the only redeeming value. And not to spoil but the moral lessons are questionable at best.",2015

1,"Spoilers, you've been warned.",2015
1,"Left the theater I just could not take the pain. Many others left as well Reading the reviews I am stunned at the number of positive reviews. Perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen I want those two hours of my life back. What am I missing, wonderful cast but the movie just dragged on and on with most songs boring at best. I did enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song without an much of a connection to a story. Again, I cannot get over how many positive reviews are out there as so many left the theaters as did I after about two-thirds of the movie and with no end in sight.",2014
1,"Very disappointed. Begins good but then downhill and keeps getting worst. At one point you may find yourself wondering if some of the long musicals are just to fill up time. Nobody can spoil this movie since the ending makes no sense. Seems like the ending was more about indoctrinating kids that wrong and right don't exist. I enjoyed the beginning and how multiple stories are integrated logically. But, around the middle it seems like all the steam is lost and as if they just did whatever to finish it by ming the songs longer and they just loosing all creativity. Seriously, while the beginning had creativity the end did not. It was as if they lost the script and began ad-libbing everything. Not only did I not like it but my kids hatted it also. My wife did not like it and my mother fell asleep.",2014
1,"This movie was absolutely, positively HORRIBLE in every sense of the word. I generally don't write reviews but I was so incensed by the stupidity of this absolutely ridiculous crock o' s*** that I had to spread the word. I don't see how this movie got any positive reviews at all. I had high hopes because of the cast and I generally like what Disney makes, but this was horrendous. From the first song on, it was a disaster filled with repetitive, pointless songs that attempt to provide moral guidance but definitely DOES NOT. This movie instead has hints of rape, pedophilia, adultery, shitty parenting and basically half the cast is killed off with the remaining cast not seeming to really give a damn as it ends with the Baker starting to re- tell the same shitty story that just happened to all of them (in which his wife died, little red riding hood's grandma and mother died, and Jack's mother died)... ",2014
7,"Half the hate reviews I'm seeing on this website are all saying ""The trailers didn't announce that it was a musical"". 1. The music in the trailer is the character's singing voices! Please pick up on that! 2. Yes, it is a musical. I really don't see how a movie can get so much hate just because they didn't know it was a musical! At least try to appreciate the music in it instead of just hating it because you don't like actual singing. 3. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON A STAGE PLAY BACK IN THE 80'S, OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BE FREAKING LONG! Honestly the people act as if they've never sat through a 2 hour movie before! Schindler's List was over 3 hours and that is a freaking masterpiece, but god forbid a musical being just over two hours. 4. If you came in to just see Johnny Depp: Stop being so stupid and be warned he's only in the movie for 5 minutes. 5. IT'S PG-13! It warns you that some scenes will frighten young children. However if you think that the movie version is disturbing then don't take your kids to the stage play! ",2015
1,"OK...so first of all I ""did"" know this was a musical, and ""do"" like musicals. I don't always go out of my way to watch them, but this one looked fun for the family and I to watch. Waste of my money, waste of my time, waste of acting talent, etc etc etc. The music was weird and didn't make any sense. Basically rhymes for the sake of making a rhyme. Johnny Depp seemed like he was trying to seduce Little Red Riding Hood by getting awkwardly close to her, the strange lyrics, and weird dancing. Plus the odd re-telling of how the girl got out of his stomach when the baker cut her open made it seem like they were on drugs when they wrote that scene. The only scene that was slightly enjoyable was the Agony song, mainly because it was hilarious whether it was meant to be or not. When the supposed ending came where everyone seemed pretty satisfied and then everything went down hill, my wife and I looked at each other with a ""are you kidding me?"" face. Things just got weirder and weirder, and once the prince started making out with the bakers wife we pretty much threw in the towel on the movie as a whole. My 7 year old daughter even recognized how odd things were getting and told her Mom how weird this movie was. We just left with the disgusted feeling that this movie actually exists in this world, and the fact that people rate a PG movie so high when it involves so many immoral things in one. Shame on you Disney. I hope this was a huge loss.",2014
1,"It's a musical, based on a Broadway play (no really, it's a musical). A misrepresented boring film, how the movie could have received a green light, just shows how little fresh ideas Hollywood has. Okay, am I being too harsh, I'm sure there will be some enjoyable tunes, interesting sets, adorable characters or some interesting twists on stories that really is en vogue at this time. No, No, No, and No! ",2014

1,"If I could vote -10 out of 10.. That still wouldn't be a accurate rating for this Musical/Fantasy film. Honestly I'm not going to go into to much detail about why this movie is beyond awful, cause honestly I'm completely drained after seeing it and the movies soundtrack/music torture list is still corroding my mental state 50 minutes after I left the theater. Story, BAD..like really bad...It's almost like halfway through the film the Director and Writer got fired and they brought somebody else in that hadn't even seen the first half of the film. Soundtrack...dear lord... I had to come home and throw Sweeney Todd in to get the taste of Into the woods ""Musical"" out of my mouth and ear drums, honestly my entire body ached after the film from tensing up to every excruciating song in the film, which coincidentally all sound the same. Acting, Meryl Streep did a great job, but even she couldn't save the soundtrack or make sense of the jumbled story, Emily Blunt does a great job as the comedic relief, Johnny Depp, in his very short and minimal role on screen reminds me of a child rapist/predator who was just released from prison and spent what little money he had on candy. Miscast plagues the film. Special Effects.. None... Plays out like a play/opera..nothing, absolutely zero special effects worth mentioning which made it hard to get lost or enveloped in the world. Picture a forest....a very generic boring forest...you have just seen 90% of this films setting/locations. ",2014
1,"My daughters opinion of this first........Daddy can we leave after about 40 minutes into it and her twisting and turning in the seat for 20 minutes at least. Daddy's opinion about 20 minutes into it, same thing. The trailer is clearly deceptive by leaving out the singing while the witch talks...........enough of it really, A movie with a few songs like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty bang bang etc...and it's okay. The whole movie makes this not a movie! This is NOT Disney material and NOT worth wasting my time. If I had not been using free passes, I would have demanded my money back! I mean Johnny Depp showing off his skills for a singing pedophile? This is some sick stuff and for someone brainwashed into thinking this sort of thing is good. Bottom line, this movie was portrayed in the trailers to be for a child with the Disney branding and trailer, which left out the singing likely to garner more views. Big mistake Disney! I think folks will be a little more wary of your trickery now. There is a difference between a movie and a musical. Bad judgement call to deceive the consumer and not make this abundantly clear it was a musical. Someones job should be on the cutting block for this one without a doubt!",2014
9,"I loved this film. I've seen the film version of the play starring Bernadette Perers and loved it as well. I think many watched it thinking it would be a happily ever after story but it's not and that's the point. I first heard about/watched the play version in a college drama class. The characters start out struggling but still idealistic. They believe they can achieve their wishes and set out to do that. Then, after they've each gotten what they thought they wanted they realized they didn't want it or in some cases they didn't want it yet. And while they're struggling to come to grips with the idea that maybe they didn't want their wishes granted after all, the giant attacks and knocks them for a loop. Characters die, marriages fail and they see that maybe happily ever after isn't an idealistic fairy tale dream but instead it's the reality of their acceptance of and for themselves as they are. I gave it a nine because I loved the narrator and missed him in this version and as well as a few other changes. Overall it was wonderful and I can't wait until my children are old enough to enjoy it with me.",2015
10,"Firstly I am very surprised Disney did this, as it is NOT for kids. Sondheim is my favourite composer and I think the film did justice to his lyrics and music. Those of you who could not understand it or follow it, cannot be a big lover on psychology and human behaviour. Sondheim is a psychologist! The woods represent the paths we choose in life, and how wishes cannot always lead to wonderful happy endings (true to life!) You go on your journey, and experience joys and pain and heartache, which you learn from. You finally discover yourself and your true purpose in life. Those of you who said their are no memorable songs in it are not listening to the deeper meaning of those lyrics. No One Is Alone. - You've lost your guide (mother) who meant everything in your world, but there are others out there in that World who are also guides. You just need to open your heart to them, and they will show you the way - put you on the right path.",2015
10,"I loved Into the Woods because it had such a creative plot. The music and singing was great, and unfortunately was and has been stuck in my head since it came out in December! My favorite character was Little Red Riding Hood (see my user name) played by Lilla Crawford because she was brave and outgoing, and not afraid to stick up for her friends, even if it meant getting herself in trouble. Cinderella was also great because she didn't want to make the wrong decision with the prince, or with anything. That's why she kind of reminded me of me. All of the characters were brave, and tried to do the best thing for their acquaintances they met along their journey into the woods.",2015
1,"A wretched musical with rotten musical score, plot befitting a porno, and only one scene with character development. Maybe the special effects were OK if you go to movies just for special effects. The all-star cast were given roles without sufficient emotional depth to allow them to be authentic. From the start, the musical phrases are trite and awkward, no doubt partly because there is not much to sing about other than 'going into the woods' which apparently is supposed to have some metaphorical significance that doesn't really develop. The whole thing reminds me a lot of the old Wizard of Oz yellow brick road trip. This was a waste of money and 2 hours of life.",2014
1,"I didn't know this was a musical. I just saw the Disney logo and the movie poster looked interesting so decided to give it a shot ... Wow. The first 20 mins they sing the same melody over and over. I guess I don't like musicals, so I'm trying to be fair, but this movie's still awful. I'd have a different opinion if the lyrics were clever or funny. But they're not. They're just boring, 99% of the time pointing out the obvious, over and over. Worse, the plot is just a rehash of well known fairy tales. Nothing fresh or original until the toward the end, which is actually the worst part of the movie. Really. It was like the writer just pulled random events from a hat and decided to use them for a plot. And worst of all, the few characters that are interesting are killed off, leaving weak secondary characters that the viewer doesn't care about, but that doesn't stop them from singing unfortunately.",2014
1,"I wish I could say that this was a great, even good movie but alas Terrible is the word I would use ! I love fantasy, I like musicals but this fantasy musical was a non starter and didn't end soon enough. The singing and songs from the start were mind numbing on the point of brain washing with they""r nonsensical repetitiveness. So many great actors, such lovely scenery and backdrops yet what a total loser of a movie. I think if this had have been a non musical offering or along the lines of the TV series "" Once Upon A Time"" I'm sure it would have worked out much better. I think this was always destined for the stage rather than the big screen I am disappointed to say.",2015
1,"So this is just a taste of the famiy friendly, PG-Rated content that this Disney film had in store for my kids: A line where a woman actually says ""he raped me"" ... A scene where Johnny Depp is basically singing a song about a ""juicy young girl"" he wants to eat but instead of you imagining him as a wolf you're imagining him as a sick stalker pedophile. Having fun yet? This film has scenes of mutilation of women's feet to fit a shoe, because what we need in a kids story tale movie is ""SAW Part 8"" ... And constant references to women being literally chased around by men like objects , and last but not least a random sudden scene of a married man and woman cheating on their spouses. Having fun yet family viewers? This is stupid and offensive. Should not be rated PG and save this garbage for adults who want to see it.",2015
1,This movie was very disappointing. I could not believe that Disney would attach its name to this garbage. This should not have been rated PG13. Things such as Johnny Depp as a pedophile wolf and Meryl Streep's psychotic relationship with Aurora might suggest that it was sexual. Emily Blunt's scene of adultery with Cinderella's husband banging her against a tree definitely made this inappropriate for me. This is definitely not a movie for your kids. I could not believe my eyes or my ears. The songs were not as cleverly written or composed as one would expect from a Disney film. Even more difficult to understand was that the movie continued even after the curse of the witch was broken. It seemed in-cohesive somehow. Why bring in another giant? This made the movie feel like it was 3 hours long instead of 2. What is worse is that Disney has made most of these stories like Cinderella and sleeping beauty iconic. Why would Disney turn their most beloved storybook depictions into a creepy nightmare? Very contradicting. And a big mistake on their part.,2014
9,"Clearly people did not realize that this was a play first. This isn't some animated bubble gum pop Disney movie. And if that's what you are expecting then don't come. Watch the play from the 80's before you come see this so you understand what this movie is about. This adaption has a great cast and great music. The scenery is also impressive. If you're looking for something that actually has character you can get behind, than I encourage you to view this film. If you're looking for a singing dog or something...this isn't the movie for you. This isn't frozen or lion king. Just because Disney is in connection with it doesn't mean it's something you bring your 3 year old to. They would get bored. It's more of an adult thing and has a good view fr each character. It does jump around to characters. But it's to try and connect their stories together",2014
1,"This was the biggest waste of time and honestly a massive disappointment. Seriously, that's all I can say. I have never written a movie review before, however walking out of this movie I have never felt so inclined to express my utter disappointment. Filling 10 lines with how awful this movie was, is simply a painful recollection starting 5 minutes in. The sinning by most actors was not pleasant, not to mention the actual lyrics became annoying. I do enjoy a good musical, which has thoughtful and creative sense behind the lyrics. This, simply did not. Anticipating the next song mixed through dialog with failed attempts of humor was less than enjoyable. I can honestly say that I cringed when the movie did not end at the wedding of Cinderella and the prince. It was so close to ""happily ever..."" but was then cut short and we had to endure an additional 50+ minutes of nonsense. This is not a movie that I would recommend to anyone. I would score it a zero if I could.",2014
1,What the heck happened to Disney. I Hated this from the moment they started singing....It was the most annoying song I have ever heard and it was sung the entire length of the movie.I can handle retelling of stories but not like this.This seriously has my vote for worst Movie of the year.I had very high expectations and I watched the whole Movie but I could not wait for it to be over! I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I am having a hard time trying to figure out just what Disney was trying to accomplish Whatever they were trying to do it was not successful.It sounded like they were trying to make this an Opera but they failed miserably!,2015

Left with the classic parental pressure to get a 'good job' and 'succeed' the opening scene with his father illustrates nicely the conflict with the realistic view of life that Nash shows him.

9,"""Red Oaks"" is the name of a Jewish country club in NJ, in the suburbs of NYC. Set in the mid-1980's, after watching the first episode I thought this would mostly be a bit of a ""Caddyshack"" ripoff. While life and the people who inhabit Red Oaks are a major part of this series, it is more of a coming of age type of story about 20 year old David Meyers, who is an assistant tennis pro at RO. David's at that point in life where he isn't sure what he wants to do. His father wants to him to follow in his footsteps and become a CPA while David wants to learn film. He is also caught in a dilemma in his romantic life.

A little more populist than his great Section 8 work, Red Oaks follows the life of a character any Gen Xer can identify with. The dialog was snappy and clever, and after watching this one half hour pilot, I felt like I had been loaded with three hours of back-story.",2014
9,The pilot was good but not great. It was a light-hearted reminder of the 80s coming of age movie comedies that I grew up with. I wasn't really compelled to watch the next episode but ultimately I did anyways just out of curiosity. As the episodes rolled by I enjoyed them more and more. Yes some of the characters are formulaic but the entire show works. I started actually caring what happens to them in future years. After finishing the 10th episode I actually am anxiously awaiting next season. There are quite a few ways the show could go and I can't wait to find out. Yes I have seen better shows but for this genre I think it was well above average and certainly worth watching.,2015
9,Look at these faulty reviews of haters. This shows is awesome. Don't listen to the negative folks in here going out of there way to type an essay and persuade u to not watch. It's a fantastic show with much effort to fulfill the audience needs while watching an 80's comedy that is PURPOSELY PREDICTABLE.,2017
9,"I started this with no expectations, actually all other Amazon Prime Video series did not get into me that much... OK, we are in the '80, so if you are born exactly in 1980 like me you are going to have a lot of revival moments, this is not sweating '80 like some other piece of TV streaming show (cough... stranger, cough... things, cough...), but there is a lot of quotes and reference everywhere. Then the whole plot is pivoting around niceness, and this is heart- warming, too many series are around just bad and evil characters, here you will find comfort after a hard work day. But the most important thing is: Time Travel. When I watch this show, time goes faster than ever! It is unbelievable how an episode slides smoothly to the end, while you think you are actually in the middle of it.

10,"Red Oaks - Amazon Prime's hit dramedy is back with a third season & we sure were thrilled to view it.
The moment we were done with the first episode of the first season of the American show set in the 70's, we were bowled over. Every episode in the series is barely 22 mins long. While the first season dealt with the lead character - David Myers's (Craig Roberts) stint as a tennis coach for a summer in Red Oaks club. The second season spoke about the subsequent summer at the club. The season ended with David breaking up with his gf Skye & Skye's father losing his court battle.
 The third season does not see David back to teaching tennis at the club. David is working in the city for ad film company. There is a new woman in David's life in the third season. His parents have moved on & are both seen to be exploring romantic opportunities with others. David's mother - Judy Myers (Jennifer Grey) is doing well as a real estate broker, whereas his father - Sam Myers (Richard Kind) has found a way to monetize his love for food. Sam has finally found love in a woman. Doug Getty (Paul Reiser) is in a minimum security prison for the rich. His daughter Skye (Alexandra Socha) does make an appearance in this season as well. A lot of time is devoted to Wheeler's (Oliver cooper) & Misty's (Alexandra Turshen) relationship. Nash(Ennis Esmer) - easily the most popular character on the show, has quite a few ups & down in the third season. He is not quite himself. He is not seen making sexist comments or flirt with women in this season. 
With a run time of barely 22 mins, you end up wanting more. Every episode is entertaining & easy on your senses. Every character is well defined. Everybody in the cast does a good job. With Nash & wheeler becoming subdued versions of themselves, Doug has the best lines this season. 
The ending does leave a lot to be desired. Despite the makers having made it clear that they won't be returning for a fourth season, there are several loose ends at the end of the show. Fans of the show will not get the closure they will have hoped for. 
For those who are yet to see a single episode of this series, we highly recommend this series. And for those who have been following the series, do watch the show & bid goodbye to your favorite characters. We believe there was scope to extend the show by at least two seasons more!",2018

4,"Just went through the Red Oaks series on Amazon This season is a cross between the Wonder Years and Brighton Beach Memoirs, except without the charm of the latter. It's a fantasy for pre-pubescent 80s ethnic males, so it's fairly narrow in its vision and view of the world. In fact, the fantasy play of two male juveniles is mostly overdone to the point that it lacks believability. ",2015
1,"Not the worst thing I've seen but definitely not good. I'm a huge fan of 'The Goldbergs,' '80s, and teen movies and this was a big disappointment and seemed more like a low-budget web series than an actual TV show. Paul Reiser? I don't think anyone cares about him anymore other than my grandmother, and she's dead. Jennifer Grey? A true waste of her talents. Watch the Sneak Peak and make your decision from there if you'd like to continue rather than waste 31 minutes on the pilot. The Sneak Peak didn't look funny but I forged ahead for the sheer kitsch value of the jazzercise leotards they promised, with hopes the show would be better. Nope.",2014
2,"This show lacks charm, originality, heart and soul. There is no thought in the creation this show, no craftsmanship, no feeling. ALL the characters are cardboard cut-outs of the originals - gleaned from 1980's TV shows and movies. There is the aimless college student main character, his neurotic parents, the egotistical rich president of the Club, and the dirtball stoner friend, - all STOLEN from other movies. The only interesting and funny character is the senior tennis pro who speaks with a weird British/Middle Eastern accent. Is this the best our entertainment industry can offer? - A trite coming of age comedy wrapped up in a bad Caddy Shack remake. My advice - use your screen time elsewhere.",2015
5,"This series is very difficult to rate. The pilot was cleverly written and well-acted with a carefully selected soundtrack curated for the moods of each scene. The drama of directionless college students, middle class middle-aged parents, and the wealthy set in a 1980s country club create highly comedic situations. The creative team clearly invested everything into that 30-minute intro so they would be greenlit for an entire season, which they were awarded deservedly. However, the remainder of the series lacked direction. The season was a collection of sub-plots that occasionally intersected as if by accident and confusingly derailed itself for an entire ""Freaky Friday""-esque episode. The one character who ended up arcing beautifully by the end, club president Getty, was unceremoniously removed from the Labor Day men's singles final (his opponent was former top 10 player and current tennis commentator Brad Gilbert!) in an attempt at a dark cliffhanger. Based on the way this played out, the series does not deserve a second season, and if they did go forward, I have serious doubts about their ability to cohesively tie together the plot threads from this mediocre first season.",2015

7,"First the positive; The story kept my attention and the plotlines were interesting for the most part. BUT, it was hard to get past David Meier and his stoner buddy Wheeler. David was a short, dead pan, at best average looking going nowhere young guy, who was dating a hot daughter of a multi-millionaire. Unrealistic to say the least. Wheeler his buddy , was an obese, unkempt messy guy who gets the hot lifeguard. Both these women were women that could easily have accomplished , handsome, professional men and yet chose to be with such losers that did not even have the bad boy aspect going for them. I somehow got passed that and enjoyed the show. The supporting characters, Richard Kind, Paul Reiser and Jennifer Grey were awesome. Not to forget , the character of Nash as the overweight horny tennis instructor , was also a very funny character. Enjoy this sitcom for what it is and you wont be disappointed .",2018
9,"Show takes place in the 80's. If you've grow up during that time, you will feel a sense of nostalgia while watching this show. Big camcorders, no cell phones, big hair, colorful sunglasses, denim, aerobics, etc. Kind of makes me want to re-live the times. Show is very well made. Great cinematography , good selection of actors, lots of settings, easy to follow plot with just the right amount of side stories going on. I would re-watch the show... can't say that about many shows. Can't wait till season 3.",2017

1,"The story line is slow and predictable if you are a 14-year-old teenage boy you might enjoy this lethargic excuse of a series. Don't waste your time, I wish I could get the 5 hrs. of my life back I spent on season 2. Do the show and its viewers a favor I call them viewers because I don't think there's are many fans of this mundane slow series, so do a favor and put it to sleep! The series is like this review site where it goes on forever. In order to post a review, it needs to be 10 line long! Why one can say if something is great or horrible in one sentence or one word for that matter, so why do they require a certain amount of words for a review beats me. This will be my last review due to the fact that I don't like running on and on when I've already said what I wanted to get across and not need to meet sites minimum words quota.",2016
7,"Doesn't have the heart or the smarts of ""Transparent"" or ""Catastrophe,"" but this new series from Amazon is still worth watching. Set at a north Jersey country club in '85, the show has a long pedigree, going back to ""Goodbye, Columbus"" and ""The Flamingo Kid"" (among many others), but the retro touches aren't laid on too thick, and the writers come up with enough original notions—a smug Turkish tennis pro at a Jewish club, a polyamorous dentist and his randy hygienist wife, a smarmy wedding photog who natters about his ""Jacooze""—to keep things from getting too generic.",2015
8,"For all who says that this movie is bad because it doesn't follow the Dracula story we all know from the past I say, it's not suppose to. When I sit down to watch a movie there's one thing that matter in the end: Did I or Did I not enjoy the movie? And this movie was definitely enjoyable and fun. ",2014
6,"While this movie pretty much ignores the history, it's still a good movie, great CGI, good acting and the ending implies a sequel. ",2014
7,"Leaving the cinema last night I found myself arguing with half the audience about the movie. Half of them said the movie sucked, and the other half (myself included) loved it. Now, this is a type of movie that will divide the audience so much that there will not be a middle. One will either love it or hate it (which seems to be a pattern in recent Hollywood history). By just watching the trailer it was clear as day that this will not be a masterpiece or a rebirth of Stocker's fable. So I ask a very plausible question: What did you expect?",2014
8,"If your looking for a good action flick with a decent plot this is the movie for you. With a 90min runtime I was expecting this movie to feel ""rushed"", it felt far from that. The action was great, it did not disappoint with all the cool vampire abilities you see in the trailer, especially transforming into a group of bats. Being a Dracula movie there are things you have to expect, yes he receives his power by drinking blood, having all the vulnerabilities as every vampire (which they do very good in this movie) but the way this movie makes you root for Vlad(Dracula) you actually find yourself engulfed in the movie wanting him to overcome the darkness and win. However if you are a history buff and it irks you when movies take real life people and change their history for a movie, you will not enjoy this because it is loosely based off Vlad the Impaler. My Review 8/10 Excellent",2014

Vlad is happily married with beloved wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and their son, Ingeras (Art Parkinson), is their pride and joy. When Vlad and his soldiers find a Turkish helmet in the river, he goes with two men to a cave in the Broke Tooth Mountain expecting to find Turkish scouts. However they stumble with a deadly creature (Charles Dance) that kills the two men, but Vlad succeeds to escape alive from the cave. He learns that the creature is a vampire.",2015
8,"many reviewers complain about the history of the movie not being accurate or truthful; in case you forget, Dracula, the vampire, is all fictitious, so why complain about history?? I don't care if the story is not along the line of the other Dracula stories we know of as long as the story is well told. such a movie shouldn't be taken so seriously; see it as purely entertainment; now back to serious review; to put it simply, I like the movie. Luke Evans is perfectly cast as Dracula. The movie is 90 minute so you wouldn't have everything 'spelled out'. It's reasonably fast paced; the movie has its flaws but minor enough that you can reasonably pass it; the only major flaw that I see and think the movie should work on explaining is how the Sultan knows about Dracula's weaknesses. Dang, Dracula almost got defeated because of the Sultan's knowledge and the director thinks it's not important to dwell on it?? that's why it's only 8 for me.",2014
10,"I can honestly say that my family and I really enjoyed watching this movie and that's saying a lot because we all have different interests in movies but this one we all enjoyed. It was exciting and entertaining and would enjoy it if there was another movie to come in the future.this movie caught me from the beginning. Some may hate this movie because it doesn't base off of the Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. This movie focus more on the legends and stories (that some believe to be true) about 'Vlad the Impaler' the prince of Wallachia. 'Vlad's' history is what led to the famous Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. 'Vlad' was the original Dracula. But Its just a movie, in which i found vary enjoyable to sit down with popcorn and watch. this movie was awesome in my opinion. but some will hate it and other will love it. in which i can say i'm one of those who loves it.",2014
3,"I've watched this movie with an open mind, intending not to look into the historical facts and just enjoy a good CGI-packed film, that tells the story of my country's most famous ancestor. But I couldn't, I just could. They've went on to use actual names for people and places, that some may think some things are actually true. Absolutely nothing from this movie has to do with reality!!! ",2014
10,"If you are looking for action meets drama, with fantastic story telling, this is the movie for you. This is 300 meets Dracula, and the result was fantastic.",2014
10,"The film itself can be rated as passable. There were a few logical glitches for the sake of the plot, mainly Vlad's shortcomings when it comes to time and resource management (seriously, I wouldn't promote him if I was his boss in a company) but that's neither here nor there. However, the most important thing about this film is somewhere else. Similarly to pieces like ""Planet of the apes 2"" and such, ""Dracula Untold"" sends a very important message - one that each and every one of you need to heed, if you want your loved ones to live. Alas, I can't write here what that message is because that would be politically incorrect and this review would be deleted. The ending was promising though it could survive having a certain element in it (I can't write what kind of element because this is a non-spoiler review).",2015
7,I remember the 1992 version of Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola and thinking that the best part of that version was the anti-heroic Prince Vlad defending Europe against the Ottoman invasion . I do believe there is a market for a historical epic featuring the true life story of Vlad the impaler . This version from 2014 does come close to it in some ways but let's be honest and say no one is going to watch any movie with Dracula in the title unless it features a vampire in the title role and one wonders how many people might have been disappointed by the marketing if not the title alone ? ,2014
2,"To Summarize, for me it is a pretty bad movie. Why? (INCLUDES SPOILERS)",2014
6,"It's always intriguing with an origin story, because it allows viewers to experience the change, in this case the man who will then become the monster we know as Dracula. This film did just enough on that part, while being sufficiently entertaining as an action flick. But it came with many minor flaws, one that culminates in a less overall dramatic experience.",2014

10,First and foremost I know it's appalling that I am giving this a 10 but because I went to watch this movie knowing fully that I ought to disregard the true history of it and the classic Dracula novel from 1897 Gothic horror by Irish author Bram Stoker. I kept and open mind and my mind was blown away. ,2014
10,"This story gives us something new to watch and keeps you on your toes on what's going to happen next. One of the best Dracula/vampire movies of all time. I'm a huge fan of all these type of movies and I feel that they did an amazing job bringing Dracula to life and a character that actually makes you fear him. Costumes in this movie are very well made, and the actors and actresses did a great job in the movie. I hope enough people feel the same way about this movie so we get more movies like this back to the classic horror movies instead of senseless slasher movies with no plot! Don't listen to negative feedbacks, be your own critic and this is worth taking the risk to find out for yourself.",2014

10,"1st of all i have read lots of books about Vlad the Impaler/Dracula because it always fascinated me. Even so, before to watch the movie i expected to be different and i accepted the new fantasy story. Strange thing is, why it has a bad note? Why people always want either the real truth or something only their mind can create/imagine? Luke plays FABULOUS, special effects are awesome, too bad it was only 90 min ""long"". And i don't really get why Turkish people make such a big deal from it. (PS: i got Turkish blood from my dad). ",2015

The content of this movie covering every aspect hats off to the director and screenplay person every one the actors did a remarkable job in this movie.Everything is just perfect! Watching the movie didn't even felt like that this part is overdone by the director or the acting is not sufficiently done or over sufficiently done it was perfect with no room to spare.The dialogues and the quotations used were excellent and not to mention the computer graphics used for action scenes was amazing. It surely needs to be seen by everyone!,2015

10,"This new series hit the ground running with adrenaline-charged action/Emergency room trauma from 15 seconds into it at a level equivalent to a blockbuster action movie. (I won't reference the army-field procedure in the forest in the first few minutes but it will knock your socks off!) The Night Shift kept the heart-pounding adrenaline up throughout the entire first season! I am enthralled and in love with this series. Great writing, great dialog/sarcasm/character development/ camera/story. This is a SMART SHOW. Any poor reviewers of this show are clearly under- educated. I feel sorry for those folks who left a negative review and obviously hate everything and the people bother to read their negativity. NBC TAKE NOTE! THIS SHOW IS DEVOURED APPRECIATIVELY!! THANK YOU!!! PLEASE RENEW SEASONS 2, [3, 4, 5, AND 6-10 ] I haven't been sparked to watch a medical drama (one of my favorite genres since I am a Doctor) since ER. The Night Shift blows Grey's Anatomy out of the water!! Grey's anatomy is a soap opera with a little medicine thrown in for garnish. The Night Shift, thankfully, is centered around original creative trauma scenes with serious medical maiming that the cast has to handle on their own via diagnosis, treatment and surgery, in the same way real overnight ER doctors would in one hospital that serves a lot of military staff.

But when you do open chest surgery in the ER, with no masks!!! What are the directors trying to portray here? Drama and coolness abounds but glaring falsity in treating patients must not be twisted. wrong wrong wrong. At least HouseMD and Greys anatomy do not distort the medical procedures (sterility etc). They need a medical adviser to make this better. The first episode with the doctor doing auto transfusion without filtering is again a misnomer with what we really do. I will not go to this hospital ever.",2014

Forget the fact that they have doctors performing heart transplants without doing tissue matching tests, doing field surgery, and hitting each other.

The troubled veteran, fighting for justice while recovering from PTSD. Give me a break. It's insulting to doctors, veterans, and people with PTSD.",2014

Certainly a great series, its the ultimate best, it shows emphasis on real people and how their work life's contribute to their professional life in the med field, it shows you also how passionate people are about saving lives and the behind the scenes of how real doctors and nurses lives are. The casting crew is amazing... its like they characters are like family members they love and care for irrespective of caste or creed.

A MacDreamy look-alike, a Meredith character, a naive intern straight out of ER, the wise counsel of the calm Dry. Green...seriously? Do television execs think we the audience are that gullible? Had trouble following the dialog, the pacing was chaotic at times of high drama. The storyline was too far fetched to be believable - a child with multiple and violent personalities.acting stiff and forced, bedside scene with dying hero so contrived. I am sure the actors in this show can do much better...writers and director to blame. I am done, shutting it off, never to return.",2014
1,"I honestly could not believe how bad this was. It looks cheaply made. The acting was like watching acting students who knew they were being filmed. Now I know some of these actors have been successful in other things. So I have to blame the writers and the show itself. It feels like a jumble of 100 other medical ""dramas"" with the all the parts that do not work. I watch stuff like this to fall asleep to but I found myself waking up with annoyance at how bad it was. This is the medical version of ""Friends with Better Lives"", which I felt the same way about after one episode. I said that is getting canceled STAT. And it was. This will never make it. They will burn it off for summer and it will be done. There is nothing worth watching on this show.",2014
1,"I watched the first episode and thought this can only get better, give it another chance. Episode 2, how wrong can one be, it actually got worse and I finally turned it off after 20 minutes. A definite no go. The acting is only as bad as the script makes it. There are a couple of good actors in this show who should be doing better work. Wonder sometimes whether they really read the script or they get talked into things. I can really claim I have been watching TV for around 55 years and have seen good things be canceled and bad things stay for a long run. Maybe they will manage to make this better but they will have lost so many viewers by then it may be too late. I'm gone.",2014

I know a lot of work goes in to each episode, but the same can be said for every show. So, that isn't an excuse. Did you run out of money? Did it not look appealing enough to order 12?

Having had the opportunity to watch the pilot episode tonight, this after fielding several high acuity patients for the last 12.5 hours, what I got out of this was an insult to the profession, that I love, Emergency Medicine ! After watching this, I am not surprised that, almost every ER in 50 states has a Google review of 2.2 or less so. I Would like to point out that in the pilot episode, WI think the first 10 minutes, the patient had a BP of 94/96 with a MAP OF 93. WTF? Not humanly possible!

Not only does it have a captivating story, but it shows realistic reactions to grief, loss, and depression. Generally films that we watch from Disney have that level of realistic emotions, even more so with films like the lion king and mulan, but with Big Hero 6 we have something that is reminiscent of this time period, so we can connect better to the characters being portrayed. Other than that, it really would be nice to hear people singing centuries rather than let it go.",2015

8,"Disney does it again! Finally, back on track with films worth watching. Big Hero 6 delicately balances humor, tragedy, coming off age, loss, and grief for it's adolescent viewers. All the while cleverly wrapping the film in a bankable comic/manga/ superhero/marvel/ xmen eque good vs. evil storyline. Hero, a classic underdog, is wracked by grief worth the loss of his brother. This super smart Hero, aptly named, it's a scrawny pubescent boy. His friends are a ragtag bunch of equally as smart boys and girl. The quest for truth and triumph of good over evil, even if wrapped in grief and loss make this a story that is entertaining and action-packed for the kids and thoughtful and question evoking enough for parents that may or may not have found a pathway to do so previously. Disney seems to have gotten this particular, multilevel, emotional based story down without the use of magic or processes. A fact that this reviewer finds completely refreshing. On the track, initially, worth Frozen, Disney has finally broken free of 'Happily Ever After' and 'Someday My Prince Will Come'. I,for one, find it empowering that the lead is a boy. And the 'hero' is him, himself. Finding his voice and power via his brother's creation BayaMax, Hero actually winds up dealing with his grief and loss by saving himself and letting go of the guilt he feels as a result of his brother's untimely, accidental death. Disney could keep this formidable formula up and running for a series with this cast of characters. There would be a demographic, for sure. But, one wonders, if this was just an incidental hit. Seemingly, the tried and true process algorithm is their bread and butter. But worth Big Hero 6,we as parents, get some meat! Encouraging more films like this!",2015

Having just watched it I will admit that yes, there are a few spots where the action and drive seem to slow down considerably, but honestly I think that, overall, the main characters are too lovable to not enjoy. The source of conflict is thin and perhaps if the movie had been centered around the misadventures of Baymax and the Harada family it would have been a bit more enjoyable for some, but for what the final product was I'm not too terribly disappointed. Can you believe that some people were up in arms over the fact that Honey Lemon was Hispanic but not ""Hispanic enough""? Talk about splitting hairs over technicalities of a film!",2015
10,"so i originally didn't care for this film. a waster of time, irrelevant to both Disney and marvels big plans. i assumed it would end up like daredevil or black cauldron, best forgotten, bow was i wrong. this film combines the amazing animation, writing and greatness of recent Disney like frozen and tangled, with the great plots of marvel. it nearly had me in tears at times, because there is so much emotion in this film, and had me laughing uncontrollably at others. the group is full of personalities that are lovable and great. baymax is the true highlight of the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great characters. wasabi is always there for the comic relief and gogo is bad-ass. but they all become great as serious characters. and you have to love how honey lemon says ""hiro"" obviously, there are some issues. no film is without sin. it is predictable, cliché and some of fred's lies are just too stupid for words. but they aren't the points that you will remember. this film is definitely worth a watch and i suggest to to EVERYONE",2015
10,"Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie.",2015
9,"Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.",2014
8,"Okay, let's first start with the pros. This movie successfully showcased how good the animation 3D technology can be. My friends and I quite enjoyed its overall quality. Also this movie has pretty much innovative elements in it, with some big high tech creations. Overall, it's a light hearted movie. I'm sure almost everyone can find it amusing. It is not perfect of course. First, seriously, all big hero movies have to start with a family tragedy? I understand revenge is an emotional treat and good for plot, but this seems to be forcing the sad parts in and I don't like that idea of big heroes all have to suffer from family loss. Apart from that, some jokes are kinda stiff. The big marshmallow bear's blalalala is pretty lame on my side. It certainly has good branding effect tho. I see big ad boards everywhere including the bus station at Zhongguancun, Beijing. In a nutshell, it's amusing, sort of funny, nice animation with fairly good character settings. You might enjoy it if not being too critical.",2015
8,"This Disney computer animated film was advertised a good few months before the actual release, including cinemas with a large inflatable rubber versions of the recognisable leading robot character, I was very much looking forward to this feature. Basically fourteen year old robotics genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo and spends his time participating in back-alley robot fights, his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) worries he's wasting his potential, so he takes him to the robotics lab at his university, there Hiro meets Tadashi's friends GoGo Tomago (Sucker Punch's Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). Hiro is also introduced to Baymax (Scott Adsit), a personal healthcare robot Tadashi created, amazed, Hiro decides to apply for the school, presenting his project - microbots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable - to gain admission, school robotics program head Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) is impressed and Hiro is accepted, but a fire breaks out at the university, Tadashi rushes to rescue Callaghan, but the building explodes and both are killed, Hiro secludes himself from others having lost his brother. One day, Hiro accidentally activates Baymax who responds to his cry of pain, i.e. ""ouch"", the robot notices one of Hiro's microbots moving in its jar and thinks it wants to go somewhere, Hiro and Baymax are led to an abandoned warehouse, there they discover that someone has been mass-producing Hiro's bots, before a masked man controlling them attacks and chases them out. Realising this masked man has stolen his project, Hiro decides to catch him, upgrading Baymax with high-tech armour and a battle chip, and he reunites with GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred, the six form a superhero team, they are all attacked by the masked man but manage to get away. The group discovers a former lab of prestigious robotics company Krei Tech, it was experimenting teleportation technology, the test went wrong when the test pilot vanished into the unstable vortex, the masked man reveals himself as Profressor Callaghan, he stole Hiro's bots and used them to escape the fire. So Tadashi died in vain, Hiro angrily removes Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving him only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan, Baymax almost does so, until the healthchip is reinserted by Honey, and he is restored, angry for their interference Hiro leaves his friends and goes home where he breaks down. Baymax asks Hiron if killing Callaghan would improve his ""emotional state"", he is not sure, but to soften Hiro's loss Baymax plays several humorous video clips of Tadashi creating and running tests on him during Baymax's development, Hiro realises killing Callaghan is not what Tadashi would have wanted, so he makes amends with his friends. The group discovers that Callaghan wants revenge on Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk), president of Krei Tech, because he blames him for the death of his daughter Abigail (Katie Lowes), she was the test pilot, so with newly formed armour and technological advances they team together to save Krei and stop Callaghan. The microbots are destroyed and Krei is saved, but the teleportation portal remains active and is imploding, Baymax detects that Abigail is still alive, trapped in hypersleep, in the abyss, he and Hiro race to save her, but with most of his armour lost Baymax realises the only way to save Hiro and Abigail is to propel them back out the portal with his remaining rocket fist, Hiro refuses to leave him, but Baymax insists and Hiro tearfully gives in, Hiro and Abigail make it back, and Callaghan is arrested. Sometime later Hiro is trying to move on, but he discovers Baymax's clenched rocket fist contains his healthcare chip (this contains his entire personality), delighted he rebuilds Baymax and they happily reunite, and with their four friends they continue helping those in need in the city, as Big Hero 6. Also starring Maya Rudolph as Cass, Abraham Benrubi as General, Billy Bush as Newscaster and Daniel Gerson as Desk Sergeant. The young leading character is a likable and sometimes vulnerable technological genius, his supporting friends all offer their good traits as well, but it is the hero's robot companion that steals the show with his kind and caring personality, and when he gets added extras he becomes much more the fantastic pal to have. This is supposed to be based on a comic book series, it apparently does not have much relation to the original, but that doesn't matter, the whole family will be enthralled by the high-octane fight, flying and chase sequences, as well as the tender moments, the references to western technology and culture is great, and the animation is superb, it is a fabulous animated superhero action comedy film. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",2015
10,"The movie is beautiful in a way that only Disney can do it. The main character is an wonderful kid, I love intelligent kids and this one has a background not so good to tell what makes his story more likable. His brother's robot is hilarious and so sweet, and his robots are completely amazing too! I cried many times during the movie. To me is an absolute must seen for animation movies fans. For kids movie will pass a good message about the will of want know and have great achievements, maybe a boost for interest on robots and science. Furthermore, the typical message about friends: with friends is easy pass by tough situations, they always help us and will be there for us. An important one. In future I absolutely will show this movie to my own kids!",2015
8,"Thankfully not the sixth film in a sextuplet, Big Hero 6 is the latest visually dazzling Disney film since the studio's resurgence. I was not a fan of Frozen, deeming it inferior to Pixar's elite animation masterpieces, and the feature- length music video to 'Let it Go' was mildly enjoyable at best. However, Big Hero 6 is much more fun, with science prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) forming a bond with his brother's home-made ""huggable"" robot invention Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and subsequently creating a team of superheroes to combat a masked villain with a nefarious motive (it's way better than I just made it sound.)

10,"Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. ",2015
9,So many movies give the story up in the trailer. Was pleasantly surprised at each of the significant reveals in the story.,2015
7,"So basically, it's a movie which is inspired from the Marvel's comic book with the same title. Removing the serious parts from the comic book, Big Hero 6 by Walt Disney is a bliss for those who ended up loving similar movies, for example, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles etc. They have changed the story a lot which makes it way too different than the comic.",2015
10,"I have seen this animated film a number of times now, and have not grown to become sick of it. I love the plot, the characters (especially my favorite, GoGo) and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for Best Animated Film 2015. The only downside is that my favorite male character, Tadashi, dies, but I understand why the writers included this in the plot, for it had a huge impact on the film and brought great reflection to - especially - Hiro Hamada. The idea that the overall 'hero' is a non-threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further interest to the film, for he ends up saving just about all of the protagonists lives, not to mention he is a very appropriate character for all audiences, as well is the film entirely. All in all, I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence, in my opinion, and look forward to any future works that will come out of this film!",2015
8,"Honestly, I didn't have very high expectations for 'Big Hero 6', considering that I'm usually not a fan of Marvel's works, but I was gladly proved wrong.",2015
10,"To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out ""OW"" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say ""I'm satisfied with your work"" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's ""Cliche"" ""awful"" ""boring"". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. ",2014
8,"One of the best animation movies in the past couple of years. Gets hold of its audience right from the beginning and doesn't lose grip until the credits. Charged with grandeur of animation, once you begin to watch the movie, neither the popcorn, the soda nor the people around can make you take your eyes off the screen. It's a real ride!! The fast paced screenplay and a very well written script around robotics keep your heels dug. May not be as good a treat for adults but will not be reprimanded by them either. For kids, it's got everything to keep them bubbling throughout the movie. From its characters to the well executed action sequences to its superb background score the movie is a delight to watch. All the ingredients of a ""BOX OFFICE HIT"" animation movie are pretty palpable. The ever evolving protagonist of the movie Baymax who senses pain around and activates, determined to go beyond limits to treat its patients (Hiro most of the times,) receives blows, puts itself through any challenge and rises again. Though just a robot that's programmed this way, the portrayal of its character is what makes Baymax the real Hero of this story. Nice job by Disney again. I hope the Disney announces the sequel soon.",2015
8,"I feel like sometimes great movies don't get enough recognition, films like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination. ",2014
9,"This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the characters—every day people like ourselves—seeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifully—but hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film.",2014
8,Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching this movie i have absolutely no clue why.,2014
8,"""Predestination"" is an incredibly original and creative film, employing what may seem like 'common' aspects of the science-fiction genre, and putting a darker, grimmer twist on them. Time travel is handled quite well in this Australian film, focusing less on the effects of travelling back (and forth) in time than other sci-fi films. ""Predestination"" uses decidedly odd pacing, beginning with a 'bang' and following that up with almost an hour of subdued plot. But oddly enough, these moments of -almost- pure dialogue and occasional flashbacks never become boring, but rather deepen the film's characters and their back-stories. The cast performances are what really make this movie 'shine'. Ethan Hawke, as usual, delivers an almost flawless performance as the unnamed lead, and Sarah Snook, an Australian newcomer, surprises with her wide range of acting abilities. Overall, the third feature film by the Spierig Brothers is a surprisingly original, daring, and genre-bending film.",2014
10,"A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film. Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing, suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever.",2014
9,"Brilliant. Thought-provoking mind bending brilliance.  Coming under the radar and screening on Tuesday night as part of the  Toronto After Dark Film Festival schedule, Predestination stars Ethan  Hawke (Sinister) in a film that caught us off guard and sent us home  with the reality of just witnessing one of the best films of the year.  Ethan Hawke plays a character without name who is a time-travelling  agent for a secret agency that uses their ability to transport to  specific dates as an opportunity to stop crime. Hawkes character (known  as The Bartender) is on the tail end of his career. And on his final  assignment, he is tasked with stopping the ""Fizzle Bomber"", a terrorist  that exploded a bomb in New York City in 1975 that killed over 11,000  citizens. The bartender had a chance to stop the bomber once before but  failed and now after a recuperating after his final jump, he jumps from  1960's through the 70's, 80's and 90's to achieve his final objective.  The time travel machine used to jump is basic and brilliant in its  simplicity  a violin case where the adjustment of the numbered and  lettered locking mechanism determines the date to which one will  travel. It is during an early jump that Hawkes character finds himself  in the 1960's acting as a bartender in a small dive bar. It's here  where he meets the character played by Sarah Snook (again, no name is  given for the character just the description ""The Unmarried Mother"").  The two main characters begin a conversation that is part Tarantino  part Mamet in its delivery and genius. The Unmarried Mother begins to  weave a tale so unbelievable that it's mesmerizing to hear it unravel.  The bartender does not seem as overly surprised at the details and at  the conclusion of the anguishing story, he offers the Unmarried Mother  an opportunity to go back in time to face the person which caused her  such grief.  The time jump of the two characters sets the timeline path for a story  that goes in directions that will be completely unseen. By the time the  Unmarried Mother meets her oppressor and the Bartender confronts the  Fizzle Bomber the directing duo of the of Spierig Brothers (Peter and  Michael) have laid out a complex plot of intersecting stories best  described as a ""snake eating its own tail."" Ethan Hawke has worked with  the Spierig Brothers before with 2009's Daybreakers which this reviewer  thought was a well above average tale of vampires in a futuristic  world. But with Predestination the collaborative efforts of the  brothers and Hawke have created a brilliant time travel science fiction  film that betters Rian Johnson's Looper in its vision and execution.  Predestination is a movie where washroom breaks are not recommended.  Every detail of the story circles back to the wonderful final reveal.  It's a film that commands attention and then rewards the viewer for the  courtesy.  When the year finally comes to a close, we will have screened over 200  films released in 2014. Predestination is sure to be on our list of Top  10 when the tallies are constructed.",2014

9,"Anyone who loves mindfuck movies and movies incredibly hard to understand at the end, will love this one. The beginning seems kinda weird, and what the director does with the beginning is planting a seed of thought into the minds of the viewers, i bet you 10 people will have 10 different outcomes thought through while watching the movie from the start. The plot twists and the originality of the movie were fantastic, haven't seen anything quite like that in a movie. The fact that all the movies main characters, except Robinson is the same person is hard to believe and extremely well thougth through and displayed for the viewers. Were else have you seen a movie which can lead to you having sex with you, giving birth to you, then bringing yourself back to 1963 to break up the relationship between yourself and yourself and taking yourself as a baby back in time and toping it all by killing yourself? Awesome plot, great idea and something very original and amusing.",2014

9,"Twisty, turny and mind-bending, one viewing won't be enough for this time travelling head scratcher. Two plots – one revolving around Ethan Hawke's temporal agent seeking to stop a terrorist, the other following the life of a precocious orphan who isn't quite like everybody else – are intricately and intelligently woven together to not only build tension but to explore provocative themes to spoiler-y to mention here. In fact, Predestination is one of those movies its hard to say much of anything about. It's such a meticulously drip-fed thriller – slowly and superbly unravelling as each and every minute of the runtime ticks on – that the real joy here is unwrapping and grasping (or attempting to any rate) what it is you're actually witnessing. In his second collaboration with Aussie filmmakers the Spierig Brothers, Hawke is in career-best form as the veteran time traveller on the brink of burning out, whilst relative newcomer Sarah Snook (born and bred South Australian) is outstanding in a complex and demanding role that has rightly grabbed the attention of Hollywood. The Spierig's also demonstrate their diversity in both the writing and directing departments, going from the enjoyable but tonally lightweight splatter-fest Daybreakers to this altogether more mature, thematically heavy and narratively elaborate sci-fi saga that still manages to maintain a high excitement level. This year's Looper or Inception.",2014
10,"This movie is hands down one of the Greatest Sci-fi films of the century. The acting was great, the plot was amazing, and it kept everyone on the edge of their seats. This plot has so many twists and turns it leaves the audience scratching their heads. I have watched a SH!T TON of movies in my life time and this is by-far the greatest. it kept me up all night trying to think of how this movie even happened. If i were to explain this movie in one sentence it would be - ""DON'T BLINK, YOU'LL MISS THE BEST PART"". If you have not yet watched this movie you absolutely NEED to!

3,"It is hard to understand the hype surrounding ""Predestination"", maybe by people that has not understood the story but pose as intellectual; or maybe by people that wants to seem smarter or more intelligent than the others and easily satisfies themselves with a weak story of butterfly effect. The paradoxical story is indeed a complete mess and the screenplay is awful, spending a long period with the past of Jane and fast-paced later when the time travels are shown. A film that needs boards and forums to be discussed by countless viewers trying to find explanation proves how terrible the story and the screenplay are. The lovely Sarah Snook, from ""Jessabelle"", steals the show with a fantastic performance and is the best ""Predestination"" can offer. My vote is three.",2016
2,"Imagine a time machine that allows you to go back in time and prevent a crime, or disaster, save a life or two, or pick a $million winner. Great idea, for a movie, but very badly expressed in this one. Firstly full marks for originality, a time machine that is/looks like a violin case (reminded me of the Al Capone movies in the 20's), But to be able to go back in time after you've had a sex change, fall in love with your opposite sex self, then have sex with yourself and get yourself pregnant, that's CRAZY to the nth degree. Makes you wonder which looney bin the screen writers and producers escaped from and what psychedelic drugs they were on when they came up with this film. Clearly they flunked physics and have re-written the laws of relativity etc that govern life on this planet, or they took one too many of those crazy pills that mess with your brain. It gets even crazier as you start to suspect that the three main characters, Bartender, John and Jane are all the same person. John is the reconstructed bartender after the explosion burnt his face beyond recognition. Granted it's a science fiction movie, and no-one really knows how to deal with time travel, and meeting yourself, etc let alone having sex with yourself, really weird'!!!!!!!! this movie would have been more plausible as a cartoon.",2015
7,"No need to give the game away: this adaptation of a Heinlein classic short is nicely directed and acted, but tries a bit hard to create the suspense of its twist. This makes the movie long in parts as it works on its building of clues, but most viewers will have guessed the ending well before the finish. All the cast put in convincing performances, with Snook stealing the show in what is essentially a three actor movie. Some back-story items are interesting- particularly the training of in-flight courtesans for the all-male astronauts - but other parts look more like fillers. In summary the movie is solid - but not exceptional in the way of, say, Inception. However - it is great to see Australia contributing to the SciFi body of work and there is nothing to be ashamed of in this contribution.",2014

The Expendables 3 is not for the cerebral it is full of blazing action scenes, comfortable humour and a plot that is held together by duck tape but it delivers in spades.

A fantastic performance by Antonio Banderas, really well done and of course the return of Wesley Snipes, great to see him back in action in a job he definitely pulled off. Mel Gibson as the bad guy worked well for me but his role could've been more crafted as far as I'm concerned. The humor was on target considering the many laughs from the audience, I certainly enjoyed it. The action was also very well executed and held a good pace. The positive (changes) compared to the former two movies was the absence of the blood and guts (adds nothing for me), this cast (additions), much better paced action and logic and everything seemed to work.

Most of the man's career has revolved around him playing the same roles for over 30 years. The trailer came out and it was extremely promising. Bringing in actors like Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis and what do you know? Stallone was even directing, a man who had proved himself a competent action director. Even of recent years, Rambo IV was pretty awesome. Ironically however, these 80s stars created something as dull and humourless as today's modern action films. Where was the fun? Where was the one liners? What should have been a spectacle piece with soul was a shaky-cam filled ride of nauseating proportions. Sure there were some small moments of fun, but they were few and far between. So, has the third iteration in the series any good? Not really.",2014
2,"First off, nobody expects a film like The Expendables to be amazing. Even the cast and writers are aware of it, which is why the first two movies in the series succeeded. They were merely an excuse for our favourite childhood action stars to blast people's brains apart and utter cringe-worthy one-liners, and sold themselves as such, and that's why the series worked in the first place. The series was pure trash and it embraced it, and so did we. I mean, how can anyone expect a film with a scene where Chuck Norris makes a Chuck Norris joke to be anything deep? If we want Shakespeare, we'll watch Shakespeare, simple as that. And so it leads you to wonder exactly how on earth The Expendables 3 ended up the way it did. The first red flags were raised when it was announced earlier this year that the film would be rated PG-13, and that was just the start",2014
8,"Don't expect too much and take it for what it is - a high profile summer action flick that's out there to bring you some light entertainment and a bit of nostalgia. The story is simple and filled with tropes but makes sense to a degree where you can buy it and focus on the action sequences and one liners, which are pretty funny. I especially liked that they went for classic action sequences, still with lots of explosions and fight scenes but keeping it tidy enough to not overload the audience - unlike other movies where action scenes start to become just flickering images because they put so much in them and so many dynamic camera movements that you almost start to feel nauseous. ",2014
8,"First off, Expendables 2 was better and I do not think anyone will argue that. But some of the poor reviews on here almost made me second guess going, and the reviews likely had an effect, since only a handful were in the theater last night (9:45 showing) My take on the young actors/new team is yes, the older one's are better but they tied in nicely in being immature where when the old team returns to clean up the youthful's inexperience issues. Bandera's was Hilarious, the few in the theater were laughing a lot at him. He was annoying, but that is what made it comical. The one disappointment, wish Chuck Norris would have made a brief appearance like in part2. Agree, the younger actors were used to attract a younger audience, but did not see that in the audience when I was there. I'm 39 and would say audience was 30 and up. Also thought perhaps the newer actors were used to pull lower the $$ down some, might be BS, but just my thought. Not the movie going type either, haven't been to theater in 3+ yrs, much rather watch at home(DVD or Blue ray) to take b-room breaks and refill my mug ;-). This movie was worth going to. Solid performance, but bar was so high with Expendables 2, will be hard to beat.",2014
8,"The third installment of ""The Expendables"" is right up there alongside with the previous two movies. Not only in adrenaline, action and impressive action stars on the cast list.",2014
9,"This film has everything a great action movie should have, better then the first two hands down. A lot more Serious which i think is the way to go in an action film, yeah it has its fun and jokes but less then the others. Stallones great in it, looking good, better then the second, the rest of the cast are great as well, all of them. So many super set pieces, Big set pieces, you can see this film had a bigger budget then the others. Seems to be quite a few haters for this film, don't listen to them, They probably don't like old school action films. Stallones best film since the last rambo i think. Great job.....watch it.",2014
7,"After the last movie, Barney goes on freeing one of his old team members, Doc. And on their next assignment there's a surprise, the target of the op turns out to be Stonebanks, Barney's presumed dead old teammate, who is still alive and now is a big shot arms dealer. Stonebanks get a clean shot at Barney but instead shot Caesar to get to Barney's mind. Stonebans' trick worked, Barney feels that he's not into losing anyone else close anymore, and decides to break up the team that's been with him since the first movie. He then contacts Bonaparte, and together they recruit young guns to make a new team. With the new team, they take on Stonebanks again and succeeded. But Stonebanks apparently has a tracker with him and the team gets ambushed on a bridge. Barney was tossed into the river while the youngsters are captured. Barney then sets up to go alone for the rescue, having only Galgo, the talkative operative formerly denied entry to the team by Bonaparte, to go with him.",2014
3,"I'm a huge fan of action movies and after watching so many movies I can tell which one is going to be a disaster. Expendables 1 was okay in my opinion, Expendables 2 was great and then there's this coming in last place. There is simply no character development in this movie. The cg looks like adobe after effects, the camera work is shaky, and there is absolutely no blood and gore. I felt nothing through out the whole movie except boredom and being angry at the fact that I'm wasting my time. Some of my favorite stars like Jet Li had like 3 Min's of screen time and that's it. Mel Gibson was no good as the villain and the last boss fight was so very weak. Jean Claude was the best EX villain. Antonio's character did okay but I think they should used his Mariachi character, instead of being a loud mouth. So much cheesy dialog's here and there; it's really not fun at all. In conclusion this is a passionless excuse of a movie. My rating 2/10 Abysmal.",2014
5,"Learning from the mistakes in The Expendables 2, the cast has reunited in this sequel with a climax that really brings back or nearly close to the old school action thriller just as in the original first film. However, having the Galgo style of plot has dragged the entire film into an unnecessary overlong of 2 hours. While the old cast still brings a lot of fun and maintains the brother love across the trilogy, the introduction of the young Expendables might seems a fresh strategy to develop possible sequels but the poor performance, poor developed screenplay and moderate quality of visual effects have ruined part of the film. At least, it compensates audiences once again with amazing scores from Brian Tyler which enhances the actions scenes but overall, Barney's emotional feelings in this sequel seems to be similar to the boring emotional Iron Man in Iron Man 2.",2014
10,"There is no doubt that Stallone and Schwarzenegger want to bring back the 80s and make todays films about action and explosions, but from the films that they have brought out in the last few years, they have drawn loyal fans who love them, and then some younger people who grew up in the late 90s watching thrillers and don't get what action films are about. They are a thrill, a ride to sit and watch and to crack open a beer with friends. The expendables 3 does just that and here are some reasons why. ",2014
5,Movie Name : The Expendables 3 Genre : Action Rating : Average 2.5 /5,2014
1,"Definitely the weakest entry in The Expendables series. Lousy acting, and too much Hollywood invincibility it's annoying. I get that the good guys in such action movies, almost always has to win, i get that. But NONE of the heroes die! Not even the new, young ones, it's pathetic! No matter how bad-ass elite soldier you are, you just cannot let, what uh 12-13 people, get away without so much as a broken arm or someone dead or something against a whole freaking army! Even Caesar is alive at the last scene, even though he wasn't in the whole movie almost and that was what it was all about, revenge, but for what? This movie is so cheesy, everything is seen and done before, but this one still doesn't manage to kinda' make it it's own in some way. And the last battle between Stallone and Gibson is just pathetic. Gibson kicks his ass the first half minute, then Stalone get's the angry ""now you're gonna get it"" look on, and get's those special Hollywood ""hero almost looses the battle but at the last crucial moment, gains momentum and defeats the bad guy"" powers, it's so old! Oh and then the cheesy one liner ""I am the Hauge"", and then BANG Gibson's all gone and the battle is won. I was really disappointed with this one, i actually found 1 & 2 entertaining enough if you just take them for the brainless action movies they are. But c'mon for Christ sakes, get some variety and let someone other than the good guys die, so it's just a little more believable and fun to watch. If the next one is just as much Hollywood bull crap and cheesy, then i'm done with these movies AND Stallone!",2014
1,"This movie isn't a 1 out of 10. Its an overall decent, okay movie, maybe worth renting. BUT. The most beautiful aspect of the 1st two, the realistically bloody action scenes were replaced by a completely unrealistic vibe of NO BLOOD at all! If you want to see blanks just fly into people and bodys flop like the NBA, then watch this movie. I see on IMDb that Rambo 5 and Expendables 4 are announced. Please Sly make these rated R and stay true to what you are good at. The final scene of this movie would have been so cool if it had the vibe and rating of the first two. Plot, story line, excitement, etc all stayed pretty good but it was just missing that realistically violent aspect.",2014
7,"So I can admit that I'm an adult woman who watches Nickelodeon (I grew up on it, and I've found that watching kids shows and kid movies helps me ease my stress because, let's face it: a lot of the shows on t.v. aimed at adults feature topics/scenarios that are too ""like real life"" for a person like me who just wants to relax). Call me an immature escapist if you want, but isn't that what t.v. is for? Anyhow, I gave ""Henry Danger"" a try -- and let me say, I was surprised that it made me laugh so much. The first eppie that I watched was the birthday party episode. And this led to watching three more episodes on-demand (my faves so far are ""Man Beast"" and also the episode where a new ""kid"" joins the basketball team). I adore the kind of humor in ""Henry Danger"" -- there are many side-jokes that are aimed at an older crowd so parents/adults won't get left out. The jokes also include pop culture references.",2014
6,"So this show had been around for quite a while before i actually started to watch it. Nickelodeon had been introducing loads of new shows at that point and honestly, Henry Danger looked boring and a childish show aimed at 8 year old kids just like all the other new cheesy shows and i had no desire to watch it. But it must have been a couple weeks later before i noticed that Dan Schneider had written it and as i had enjoyed all the previous shows that he had created (icarly, victorious, drake & josh, Sam & Cat) i decided i might give it a try. And of course, it was really cheesy as expected but i forced myself to watch it and i found out that the episodes were actually quite entertaining and lighthearted. Of course, some of the characters do annoy me like Jasper, Charlotte and Piper but because i really like the personality of Captain Man and Henry i am able to watch it. So even if you say to yourself that you can't bear to watch one whole episode, just do it and maybe you will actually like it. It'll bring out the kid in you if nothing! The script is fun and many of the jokes make me laugh or at the least they make me smile:)",2015
1,"I've watched all of Dan Schneider's shows beginning with The Amanda Show followed by Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious, and most recently, Sam & Cat. All of Dan's shows have been hits in my book so I thought I'd give this one a try. I couldn't even get half way through the episode before having to stop. The plot was stupid and the laugh track kept getting on my nerves. I was surprised that the show didn't turn out well due to Dan's previous streak of shows. This show seems mostly aimed at kids 8 years old. Even for them, the concept is outrageous. I think this is the excuse to have a show aimed for boys because most other shows are aimed towards girls. What makes it worse is that it's not set in the same world as his other shows. I wouldn't recommend this show to other people.",2014
1,"I've always been a fan of Dan Schneider's shows. I really didn't expect to like Sam and Cat, but I was pleasantly surprised, and was a little bummed it didn't get another season. I watched the movie premiere of Henry Danger, and though didn't completely love it, was willing to give the show a look. I just tried to watch the first episode and aside from the Henry character, pretty much all the characters are completely annoying. There's the dumb male friend, the overly precocious, sassy female friend and the unbelievably obnoxious and unfunny little sister. None of these characters are even likable. Sorry Dan, thumbs down from me on this one.",2014
1,"This show has a fun and interesting premise: an average middle school boy becomes a super hero's sidekick. There are endless possibilities for a smart and funny show but the producers went with slapstick comedy, idiotic characters, and low brow humor. My nephew was 13 when the show debuted, the same age as Henry Hart, a.k.a. Kid Danger. I asked him if he liked it and he told me it insulted his intelligence. After watching several episodes, I agree that it is indeed insulting to the intelligence of its target audience. Nick and Disney seem to love the show's star, Jace Norman, who is a cute kid but hardly a great actor. His performances consist of him strutting around the set making juvenile facial gestures and doing pratfalls. The rest of the cast is relegated to a secondary story-line that has nothing to do with the main plot. It seriously is like watching the rich spoiled kid everyone hated in middle school with his own TV show. I watched one of the new Season 3 episodes and laughed. Not because of the show but because Jace Norman has had a major growth spurt and now towers over everyone else on set and looks like a grown man dressed up as a little boy. Knowing how kid actors are chewed up and spit out, I predict this is the last season for Henry Danger and its star. I have nothing against Jace Norman and I hope he ends up as a happy, functioning adult. Henry Danger, however sucks and deserves to die.",2016
1,"I love Dan Schnieder. I have watched Drake and Josh, Victorious, ICarly, The Amanda Show and even Game Shakers. They are all great shows but this one annoys me so much. Where to begin??",2015
8,"Let me start by saying I'm a female in my 40's. My son who loves superhero movies couldn't wait to watch this. I have to be honest and say that I can barely tolerate most Nick Shows. For ""movie night"" I told my son I'd watch this with him. OMG. I have to say I really enjoyed this show. I can't remember the last time a show made me laugh so hard I cried. It might be a corny movie/show, but it is very entertaining. Since I LOVE sarcasm, I think the superhero is HILARIOUS!! A few days before I'd just watched Batman and Robin with George Clooney. This show blew that Batman and the horrible script and acting out of the water.",2014
5,"This show is okay. I think the show has potential, but the show does look cheaply made. The costumes don't really look like super hero costumes, like Henry's red cargo pants. ",2014
1,"This show is stupid man. First off the show is so unoriginal basically ripping off batman. (with batman and robin)And I think this is the worst superhero name ever. Captain Man. Also this show has a non stop laugh track that plays constantly after every ""joke"" (Can't really call it that since the jokes are dry as a desert)Also, I really don't know how this can be counted as comedy because ITS NOT FUNNY! Adding a laugh track after every sentence make the show extremely cliché and ANNOYING. Just a boring, bland and unoriginal show that needs to end. (It will never end,believe me.)",2016
7,"Henry Danger is a show with a very different story plot and ideas, which make it quite interesting. It takes the ""superhero"" concept and applies it in a modern sense, which make the show a refreshing one. That being said, some of the humour is pretty dry and forced....and also quite repetitive. I find Henry's little sister to be extremely annoying and bratty, and her screaming irks me, although she does pretty good for her character. Henry and his friends are pretty funny at times, but that's about it. Many of the actors act well, but again, the seemingly repetitive humour makes the show a bit boring. At least it steps out of the typical sitcom high school setting, where everyone is dominated and controlled by silly stereotypes, and uses a different concept and approach.",2015
10,"I absolutely love this show! When I first watched the hour-long episode I was hesitant at how it would continue. But this show proves once again, that Dan Schneider knows how to write hilarious scripts for the characters. Jace Norman, Ella Anderson & Riele Downs are great actors that only get better as the episodes continue! The kids have enjoyed watching Ella Anderson as a guest on different Disney shows & the Fairly Odd Parents movie, so we were all very excited to see her on this show. She has done an amazing job! Her character is hilarious because she captures the very essence of today's generation on social media, of course a little exaggerated to make it funnier. And she does a great representation of being a bratty younger sister! Jace Norman is fantastic as Kid Danger. A very natural actor who makes the kids laugh a lot! Overall, this is a great show that makes the kids laugh hysterically & the adults enjoy some family time!",2014
1,"This show is just awful. a total complete waste of money to make, time in watching and an insult to my intelligence. Whom ever wrote this big heap of crap should be stopped from writing anymore and whom ever allowed this garbage on TV should be fired. staring at a wall all day is better than watching 5 minutes of this show. everything about it gets on my nerves, the acting is bad, the story is bad in each episode. I have to set through this because I have kids...I mean I've seen crying cock roaches on this which their tears makes captain man weak..a boy gets stuck in skinny jeans and needs captain man, and a bucket pod cast? lol stupid just stupid.and one more thing,a grown man playing a super hero needing a side kick and finds it in a little boy instead of another adult?...Hmmm, sounds like a pedophile....there you go Captain Pedophile.",2015
3,"Henry Danger is a pretty bad sitcom that's created by the known creator, Dan Schneider. I don't know what's happening, but Dan's shows are just getting worse and worse. In my opinion, it was unnecessary for this show to have a movie, also, this show looks cheap and low-budget. (Look at the costumes, and the backgrounds.)",2015
1,"Henry Danger is one of those shows that obviously was forced on the public because Dan Schneider has a production deal with Nick. And that's the only reason. He's produced popular shows in the past for them so the executives probably winced and rolled their eyes behind his back when he proposed this turd, but had no choice but to add it to the schedule. It has that rare combination of an unoriginal premise ( Nick already had a superhero show, ""The Thundermans"" ) and unappealing actors . If someone gives you the choice of either watching this show, or having your face slammed repeatedly in a car door, choose the latter.",2015
1,The jokes are very cheesy not funny plays laugh track way too much plots don't make sense and if they are super heroes they barely fight this show is awful this show is Dan's Schneider's worst show this is the bottom of his bakery it needs to be cancelled it's cancerous to watch Dan Schneider needs to be fired he can't come up with a good show anymore,2017
8,"I've always loved Dan Schneider's sense of comedy. From All that to Icarly have been my favorite shows. And even though this how doesn't live up to those show's qualities, its still makes me laugh every time i watch it. Its got a combination of weirdness and random and they go together really well in this show. Sure, it doesn't live up to Drake and Josh' style of humor but i will still watch it when i'm bored. It kind of has its own unique plot. A kid becomes a superheroes' sidekick and has to deal with his normal life along the way. Sure, this plot is used everywhere but this one takes the cake. And once again, Dan Schneider has made a great comedy.",2016
1,"This show is awful, and I mean it when I say it. There has never been a show that has made me cringe this much. I can't believe the new low that Dan Schneider, who used to have talent, has sunken to.",2014
1,"First of all Jace Norman is the worst actor I have ever seen on Nickelodeon.He is so annoying and makes me mad anytime he starts acting . They all treat kid danger's ""best friend "" jasper bad . Captain Man doesn't like him , kid Danger's dad doesn't like him in fact No one likes him . They show little care when he gets injured .Henry claims he is his best friend meanwhile he never acts as such. Dan Schneider's pen for writing good shows ink got finished when drake and Josh went off the air . All the actors in this show are just awful .Piper the little brat who is disrespectful to everyone including her parents is a bad example for kid's watching . Captain Man instead of accepting the fact that Henry's mom is married he doesn't but always tries to hit in her ..Worst hero ever . Henry's feels good catchphrase is just lame . I don't want to waste my time typing on this piece of crap of a show ...Don't watch it please",2016
4,"Good god this show is horrid. All these characters are awful, Captain man is one of the worst superheros i've witnessed, his power is that he can't get hurt. How nice, i mean it's not like lasers or strength. THe other characters are bland; Charlotte and the other workers of the shop do pretty much nothing important, Henry is passable, Jasper is basically their butt monkey but not done correctly, finally let's talk about Piper. She is the most annoying little runt, she physically abuses Jasper the most next to Captain man and doesn't get any repercussions what so ever. She just acts like a brat and laughs at Jaspers pain. Do not let your children watch this",2015
2,"Dan Schneider has done so many good things for Nickelodeon, but this was not one of those. In this show, Henry Hart is a thirteen-year- old who works as the sidekick of Captain Man. In these stories, we get a bunch of cheesy and stupid conflicts. This show seems to take place on another planet, I'm convinced. One example of weirdness was Miss Shapen's large toe from ""My Phony Valentine."" Who on earth was asking for that? The main characters are far from good too. Piper Hart is Henry's little sister who acts like Megan, except that she's a social media freak. Megan may have been unlikeable, but she was charming enough to be a fun evil girl. She was on the lines of Orochimaru from Naruto or Aku from Samurai Jack. I really ought to give it up to Miranda Cosgrove as an actress. Not just that, but she was able to manipulate everyone else, so they never believe Drake or Josh when the duo blames Megan. However, everyone already knows Piper is unlikable. So, idiocy ensues when she tries to act like Megan. Jasper is Henry's best male friend who exists as comic relief. However, his gimmick either comes across as annoying like in Henry and the Man-Beast or uninteresting like in Let's Make a Steal. Captain Man comes across as the most annoying character on this show. One example of his jerkiness was getting Piper to lose her temper. The reason why was Henry and Charlotte have to eat pumpkin guts from JAM Session. Speaking of Henry and Charlotte, they're the most tolerable of the main cast. Nevertheless, that's not saying much. Overall, this show is a big mess. If they want to be surreal, that's fine. But if they want to do that, they must hook that to real world logic. I don't recommend that anyone should watch this.",2017
8,"Of the youth series at Nickelodeon in recent years, this is the best series. It has everything that should be in a comedy: great and funny actors, an interesting plot in every chapter and more. I became very attached to some of the characters there, especially the trio of Henry, Charlotte and Jasper. Also to Captain-man. The series appeals mainly to teenagers aged 15 and over, and I think adults can enjoy it as well. The rating I gave her is 8, I was based on the fact that the series of course is not in the top 10 best series I've seen, but definitely on the top 20-30.",2017
7,"I think it is a good show for kids and (adults alike :kids at heart) I normally give the show about a rating about a #7 but the past episode Bucket Trap. When Henry and Charlotte told Jasper the Fake secret...just to see if he would be able to keep a real secret Jasper's reaction was PRICELESS (I gave that episode a #9) I admit I'm not a kid (I am a kid at heart) but I watched it with my niece's they love it (I actually laughed with them, sometimes even more than they do) I love the original cast...I'm not crazy for the others who have recurring roles...(Henry's ""sort of friends""..if that makes sense?) Riele Downs: Charlotte, is great for the show ""I think she's hilarious"" She really bring out the comedic aspects of the show. Don't get me wrong they all have comedic aspects, But Riele OMG",2015

5,"Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are very capable actors. They've proved it time and time again, and That Awkward Moment is held afloat because of the chemistry between these three actors. Their bromance is electric. I would watch an Entourage-style show between the three of them and their antics, it's that believable. Unfortunately, the material they have to work with here is artificial and stupid. There are some lines in this movie that no one would ever say. And I know that's usually the case with romantic comedies, but this movie takes it a step further and totally demeans women every chance it gets, and I'm not one to point out misogyny in movies, but it just gets stupid after a while. ""Let's all make a pact to not get into a relationship! Let's keep having sex with random girls and never fall in love! High-five!"" It's such a dumb premise, and it's like the script keeps wanting you to hate these characters until they ""redeem"" themselves by the end but again, it's so artificial that you don't buy a second of it.",2016
4,"One would suspect that this film would offer the audience at least a fun experience and a decent amount of humor, but That Awkward Moment fails to deliver in every way. Not only does the film have a very predictable storyline and clichéd characters, it is also poorly paced and lacks any sort of momentum. The writing is weak and provides very few humorous moments, with the only encouraging aspect being the performance of Miles Teller, whose comedic talent does shine through. Overall, however, the three leading men lack any sort of chemistry, which results in disappointing delivery and causes the characters to be uninteresting. That Awkward Moment therefore fails to produce characters that are relatable on a emotional level, despite that being the film's main aim.",2014
10,"OK, so there were some parts when their morals were completely off but I still loved this movie! I loved that it was a comedy but at the same time it had its completely serious moments. And Zac Efron and Miles Teller shined in this movie. Especially Miles. He rocked in this movie. I love it when Miles does a comedy but has his serious moments like in The Spectacular Now. And Zac Efron. wow, Zac Efron. He really showed you that High School Musical is over. He really stepped up his game in this movie. And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. I've never seen him before but I really liked him in this movie. So, if you are looking for a funny, a little heartfelt, sometimes serious movie, this is the one for you. I would watch this movie again.",2014
2,"""That Awkward Moment"" was appropriately named, as most of the movie was scripted, forced, and cliché. As a 23 year old female, I was actually insulted that this is what Hollywood thinks is interesting or relevant to my demographic. It seems as though people this age have been dumbed down to toilet humor, drinking, cursing, and casual sex. The plot line was so uninteresting and predictable that had I would have been more intrigued watching an episode of Barney. It almost seemed like it had elements of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" that went horribly wrong, especially because of the lack of character development. The plot even fell short of the cliché I was expecting, as at least 2 of the characters never had that magical moment where they realize the wrongs of their ways and mature. They were the same, stagnant personalities all the way through the film, the only things that changed were their relationship statuses. Having three main characters with their own stories, the film had at least a 1 in 3 chance of making an intriguing story line. Instead, the plot walked the already worn out path of the traditional romantic comedy script. To make things even more painful, the comedic timing was so off that even elements that could have been funny (the coworker Fred) were just awkward and odd. The overuse of ""f---"" added to the awkwardness as you could just tell that random cursing was interjected into lines, maybe to make it more ""youthful."" ",2014
5,"""That Awkward Moment"" is a romantic/sex comedy about three male best friends in their twenties living in New York City. Two of them, Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller), work all book cover designers in a publishing house. The other, Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), is an emergency room doctor. ",2014
7,"I was discouraged when I saw the low ratings for this film, but thankfully I had already started watching it. It is definitely not comparable laughter-wise to movies such as This Is The End or 21 & 22 Jump Street, but it is very good. The type of humor may not be for everyone, but I found it to be very relatable. The way the jokes were delivered is how my friends and I joke most often. The actors in it were great and the story moved at a nice pace. Miles Teller was great and I now look forward to his work in the future, Imogen Poots was lovely and Zac Efron was great as always. I don't think Efron gets as much credit as he deserves. It portrays a few different likely dating situations that people could find themselves In these days. I would say it's more for twenty-something's than any other age group. If you are at all curious about this movie I say you should give it a shot!",2014
10,"I have read a ton of reviews saying this movie is not worth seeing but I don't understand. I laughed the whole time. Come on, it's three 20-something's fooling around with women. What do you expect? Oscar winning acting, costumes, music and writing? No. It's a feel good comedy meant to entertain you. And that's what I got out if it. And so did the rest of the theater, I'm assuming from the constant laughter.",2014
2,"The ad campaign for TAM gives the impression that it will be, at the very least, a fun romp, but don't be fooled. TAM asks us to sympathize for and laugh with the most deplorable and chauvinistic of characters, like the obnoxious guys in high school who thought they were funny but weren't. Every ""joke"" is about poop or sex, which can be funny. Here, however, they are so poorly delivered and juvenile it's hard to tell if they were even meant as jokes or just as statements of misguided philosophy. We follow three best friends who decide to call off real relationships in lieu of hooking up with as many women as possible. This tired story and accompanying dialogue are not only uninspired, inauthentic, and stupid, but make no tonal sense here. The drastic jumps from bad sex comedy to melodrama are so clumsy it's hard to know whether to blame the editing, the directing, or the script. Such a shame considering of the waste of young talent. Sure, Teller presents moments of charm, but no one is really given anything of quality to work with. There are a few laughs, but for the most part I couldn't help feeling like I was watching a soon-to-be canceled sitcom. The writers seemed more interested in writing bad one-liners than creating originality or emotional connection between characters. Even my wife, who normally loves anything classified as ""romance"" and/or ""comedy"", resorted to playing Candy Crush for the last half. If you're looking for a funny bro-mance, go see Anchorman 2.

That Awkward Moment seizes every chance it gets to be as clichéd as possible and to be as unfunny as possible. Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan turn in acceptable performances but that is overshadowed by the thin-as-ice plot and crude humor, which ends up losing two good performances in the mix. To be fair to those involved, this film should have either been shelved or given more thought, either or doesn't give this film a leg to stand on. The next Knocked Up it is not. This is Sex and The City with too much testosterone and not nearly enough laughs to justify any of the plot holes, clichés or how these characters treat women. This isn't a rental, this is more like a bottom dollar movie you take a chance on at Wal Mart.",2014

1,"I have seen this movie before. It had different actors and the characters had different names but the story was the same. Hot boy with attachment issues meets his perfect girl. They get to know each other and get on so well and fall in love. They fall out over something that he did and then get together in the end and live happily ever after. Also you have his two less attractive best friends. One is a jerkish comic relief and the other a serious straight edge guy who is in a serious relationship and is trying to overcome some kind of monotony. Which in the end he does overcome when he has a great epiphany, finds the girl with glasses and gets together with her. It's so cliché! When she came over to his house and was playing xbox with the guys I knew she would turn around to look at his with a cheesy big smile. I knew that when she rang him in the bar that her father was dead before the lead character told us. I also knew that the comic relief guy would end up with his female counterpart the moment I saw her and that they would end up fighting because he never told his friends they were dating because of the bet and he also has commitment issues. (note that I don't even know their names. I don't need to cause I don't care about them, they don't make me want to care.) Also the actors I feel should have been in their 30's to have those kinds of jobs and plot lines they seemed a little young that may have been another reason why I didn't connect with it. Blah blah blah altercations, no man is an island, resolutions, happy endings! I didn't even finish the film!",2014
3,"The acting is bad, the movie is poorly written. The dialogue is cheesy and there are clichés everywhere you look. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was because there were SOME funny parts in it. Zac Efron cursed more than he needed to (I assume to try to distance himself from his High School Musical days.) The characters are boring, the movie is longer than it needed to be and it was just tale of guys who try to have sex with attractive women and end up falling in love with them. There's really nothing else in it and everything was SO PREDICTABLE. I guess male teens will like it but I actually enjoyed the previews before the movie started more than the movie itself.",2014

3,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writing about lousy movies is no fun, but if I can save even one person from wasting $10 and two hours on this garbage, it's worth it. The only way this got the green light is because of the success of The Hangover movies, Sex and the City, and HBO's ""Girls"". The difference is that all of those projects had a sense of humor and style, while writer/director Tom Gormican somehow finds it creative to end numerous scenes with someone calling someone else either 'a f***ing idiot' or 'an A-hole'.",2014
2,"Well, that was a waste of time, and I won't spend any more time than necessary writing a review of this poorly written, poorly produced, and poorly acted movie. My first question is: What ever happened to clever humor? Every so-called joke is sex-based. People cannot even have a conversation unless it is based on something sexual (Oh, sorry, there is also some bathroom humor to break the monotony). These are 12-year-olds in thirty-year-old bodies. For some reason that defies all explanation, girls are attracted to these losers...but, then again, likes often attract likes. What's worse is that, towards the end, the director has the audacity to expect us to suddenly take this nonsense seriously. But, by this time, the only thing the viewers are taking seriously is a suicide attempt. I watched this so you don't have to. Don't waste your time on this one. Work on your compost pile. It will be far more enjoyable.",2014
1,"This movie was terrible! I watched it with friends and I wanted to stop it less than 30 minutes into it. I was outvoted, but we all agreed afterwards that it was a waste of time. Zac Efron has done some good movies (The Lucky One and Neighbors) but this one was a dud. The writing was terrible, and the movie just went nowhere. Miles Teller was by far the worst actor in this film. I have never seen this guy in a movie before, but he should look for another profession. There was no plot in this movie. The scenes just seemed random. This was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last year. Definitely not worth renting or buying.",2014

No one else would watch this trash, at least I sincerely hope not. My date didn't research the movie, we just thought a nice comedy would be fun. Mistake. And talk about an awkward moment on our first date !! I felt so bad for him. Luckily he is a gentleman and got me the heck outta there !! We will be sure to be very careful and research the movie before going in the future. Actually it's a shame we have to do that.

1,"That Awkward Moment is an incredibly repulsive and execrable movie, and even though I seriously considered leaving the cinema various times while I was watching it, I didn't do that in order to evaluate all the things this film did wrong. Or, better said, all the things it didn't even attempt to do well. That Awkward Moment obviously attempted to be a romantic comedy for men, combining the frank sexual discussions from Sex and the City, the vulgarity from American Pie and the picturesque New York setting from Friends. However, the result is an antipathetic and tedious collection of clichés which is absolutely lacking of laughs, romance or the slightest comment about modern relationships. It would seem that director and screenwriter Tom Gormican learned the routines by heart, but didn't comprehend their meaning. It's distressing to see the actors uselessly trying to bring their ""sparkling"" dialogues to life, or looking for laughs with their grotesque adventures (The artificial penis fell into a champagne cup! Jo, jo, jo!). But the worst thing of all comes when the unavoidable dramatic moments come... those were the only moments in which I laughed a little bit, watching Zac Efron trying to ""act"" and prove he's now a serious performer, far from his Disney past, and ready to show his rear and say the ""F"" word as many times as possible. My apologies to his female (and male) fans; Efron might be attractive, but in That Awkward Moment, he looks like a parakeet saying the lines someone wrote for him. In sight of recent brilliant deconstructions of romantic cinema, such as About Time and The Spectacular Now, the existence of That Awkward Moment is even more unacceptable, because it ignores the evolution of the genre in order to treat the spectators like idiots; as if the jokes about masturbation or Viagra were new or relevant. In summary, stay very far from this piece of junk.",2014

Sure i could look at a thesaurus and rhyme off a sea of synonyms to kick start my inability to word it correctly. But the movie is that dreadful it's really not worth the time; it has already wasted 2 hours of my life (if you include the trailers).",2014
8,"The Babadook isn't for the mainstream crowd. If you're looking for jump scares and scary monsters you wont find any here. The Babadook is a movie that taps into the basal emotion of fear. It portrays the truly terrifying things in life - grief, loneliness, and despair. Not things that freak you out but things that make you unsettled, disturbed, and human.",2015
8,"Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled. ",2014
10,"At first glance, The Babadook may sound like a tale that warns people  to not let children put creepy stories up into their heads. It may also  be like one of those old horror movies with children being influenced  by the ghost. The titular monster seems to have the potential of being  a silly urban legend, such as Slender Man or the Hash Slinging Slasher  (sorry about that), that is destined to be flooded with fan fiction, or  simply just another horror movie icon, but the film surprisingly has a  different aim than just scaring the audience. It might as well be a  character study of a mother having a hard time moving on after the  tragedy she's been through losing her husband and trying to raise her  only son. The real horror doesn't come out that quick, but there is  already a pretty compelling movie when it come to its characters. The  tension is just the prize for being intrigued by the story's core.  One thing people must know about the film is it's not generally about  The Babadook monster. In spite that the antagonist has an ambitiously  great campy design and his story is told well by a twisted storybook  with wondrously illustrated diorama, the movie is still laden on the  more human element of the tale, which is the struggle of a mother who  is unable to live normally. The pacing of her life may move too fast  for the film, but the sadness and deprivation beneath those regular  troubling days are totally manifested even without extending any of its  breathing. The plot mostly concerns Amelia finding a way to overcome  Samuel's behavioral issues and her memories with the accident than  dealing with the whole supernatural threat, for sure it is trying to  build some slow burn, but even without that horror movie sense, it  still feels like they're being tormented by life.  It deliberately takes their personal grief seriously, making sure that  they actually aren't insane, and nobody else could ever understand what  they're going through. This is pretty much the most compelling view of  the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own  nightmares. Mister Babadook only becomes the boiling point of the  ordeal. And when it hits to the part of the real scares, it sells well  whenever the monster attacks. Instead of loud lazy jump scares, it  rather spreads away signs of his presence and its effects to the  family. His appearance has more terror if he's lurking in the shadows.  It also has a nice use of practical effects to endure its very  effective creeps. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for  bringing the real heart of the picture. Essie Davis embraces the  character, making her fear, depression, and shifting madness all  visibly genuine. Same to the young Noah Wiseman who as well gives his  character's actions some sense of anxiety.  Some horror fans might get slightly disappointed for not giving The  Babadook monster enough of the characterization he deserves. The other  story is a lot more interesting to follow than his diorama tricks, and  that is why I keep stating that the the movie is best viewed as a  gloomy fairytale about a mother and a son fighting to keep a hold of  themselves and promise to protect each other from the odds, even if the  promise doesn't always apply, than just another horror movie being  shown in our theaters. While it still has the right amount of admirably  campy scares, the film often explores to the larger and much affecting  side of the story, and that sure offers beyond than what you expect to  this stale genre.",2014
7,"It's a rare thing when I give anything labeled horror more than a passing glance. The genre has become so completely oversaturated by teen slasher flicks, soulless gorefests and inferior remakes. Having said that I'd heard enough to convince me this may be one of the rare exceptions, unsurprisingly this is a low-key non-Hollywood affair. ",2016
8,"You've heard of feel-good films, well this is not one. It's creepy and disturbing pretty well all the way, a good old horror fantasy with a nod to the psychological canniness of Nightmare on Elm Street but much more economical in terms of special effects, casting and I would imagine budget. It nevertheless maintains tension and atmosphere along with some high-flying dramatic sequences from the actors which bear comparison with The Exorcist. The plot also connects nicely with the psychological and existential conflicts facing a single mother whose son's birth coincided with the tragic death of her husband, and the whole nasty Babadook phenomenon, and its unresolved outcome, can certainly be read as an allegory of this traumatic event. Maybe it's over-reading to say the film also contains a Nietszchian lesson about the importance of embracing every aspect of one's life and history, no matter how horrific - but it works for me. The acting is amazingly good from the two leads, although the supporting characters are a bit stereotyped, a directing decision presumably. Sets and locations are charged with a bleak gloom, and the colour accordingly verges on monochrome. Love the specially made children's book, and Mr Babadook's physical character, as well as the wonderfully curated vintage movie footage appearing throughout on the TV screen. And a special word for the very fine intricately crafted sound design.",2014
10,"I saw this film on Copenhagen pix yesterday. The movie was compared to ""the orphanage"", and even though i liked that film i was a bit in doubt if i should go for it because i was not in the mood for a heavy emotional, mother and son horror-drama. But its everything but. Sure its horror, sure its drama, but the tone is very different from the Spanish movies around same kind of subject which are very serious.This is way more fresh, snappy and sometimes funny actually, without being lame. But also creepy, its the change of moods thats freaky. Nice style. The actors are supreme and the whole socialrrealistic scene around it is far out and overexagerated, which the horror part also is. But it works, because its a metaphorical movie describing a feeling. Its highly original. If you expect the same supernatural children horror movie As you have seen before, think twice. This is new, this is cool, different. The best movie i have seen in a year. Serious. It never gets melodramatic, its fast, entertaining and a bit psychedelic. Very refreshing. And smart, clever. It has it all. I am a big fan.",2014

9,"While ""The Babadook"" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in ""Cabin in the Woods,"" this film's characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.",2015
9,"Let me start off with a little disclaimer: I am very picky with my horror movies made after the year 1990. Although some are excellent, I feel that they are few and far in between. I strongly believe that this is one of those few movies, and I urge you to watch it - no review necessary. GO NOW! This is one of those movies that isn't ""in-your-face"" scary, and it doesn't have jump-scares galore either. It's subtle, suspenseful, and downright creepy. There is a point in this movie where some believe the director lost the audience, but I beg to differ. This simple plot-twist was used to DRIVE the plot, not BE the plot (like in some other big- budget movies I won't name). The only little complaint I have about this film is the ending. I feel like they didn't know HOW to necessarily ""kill the monster"" properly and wanted a happier ending then most horror movies these days, but that only knocks this one down by one star for me. Now, before I spoil anything for you, I suggest you go and make up your own mind about this new horror classic. This is definitely one I wish we could have had in theaters this past Halloween, I'd buy two tickets!",2014
9,"It's not a typical horror movie and that's also what makes it great. There are some bad reviews here but what I always do is check out the reviewers... I pick one that said the film was horrible and one that said it was great. A quick check on their profile and looking at their other reviews helps give me some perspective on their taste. For example one of the bad reviewers on here enjoyed the movie Jessabelle. While not an awful movie. It's also a movie for dumb people. Simple and easy to understand and nothing really spectacular goes on. The acting is mediocre and the script predictable. It's like a high school film. She also gave Night at the Museum 10 stars. So you can tell she is probably a teenager. I do that with just about every movie I watch on Netflix. To help me not waste time. It's amazing because there are a ton of great movies that get average ratings here, and a ton of average movies that get really high ratings here. Like The Conjuring. That got very high ratings and it just wasn't that great. It was good but not a stand out. America has really really bad taste in film. Actually, in just about every genre of art. We have zero culture , and the rest of the world considers us it's blonde cousin for a reason. We are the dumbest nation in the world. But if a movie gets really high reviews here and those reviews are overwhelmingly good, you can bet it's a pretty good movie. At the least well made and entertaining. This movie stands out for a few reasons and here are the reasons it stood out for me . Because it is totally original. And it's so candid about parenthood.. Any parent can relate to this film, esp if they have kids with ""issues"" or that have been through a lot in their small lives. It captured perfectly the slightly troubled child. I too think that it showed what I know I've experienced as a single mom with two kids .. That need for space that you just don't get. The need for adult interaction that you also don't get if you don't allow yourself it. So there is a deep well here for character study and relationship dynamics.. I mean deep as in horror movies. So, on top of that the movie is freaky and strange and frightening . This is by far way more of a mind f*** than any Rob Zombie movie for me. A lot of people Really appreciate that kind of movie , like The Hills Have Eyes. They want the most disturbing , cruel , disgusting things to watch. I'm not them . I have to believe a movie for it to be put in the good box. Although those movies are entertainment , they also are like a prank in a way . Like all the directors got together for a game of Spin the Bottle and the ones that made like the Texas Chainsaw films asked for Dare. This movie isn't going to appeal to kids. , isn't going to appeal to the Hills Have Eyes fan club, the people that don't like to expend any energy on thinking , or just in general have short and shallow attention spans that they really a can't focus on anything that isn't doing something horrible is happening.",2015

7,"Original and truly terrifying, ""The Babadook"" proves what a horror-fiction movie could do with involving more on psychological emotion from it's protagonist character rather than shocking audience with ghost appearances. It has totally different ways to scare compared with James Wan's ""The Conjuring"" or ""Insidious"". The movie focused on Babadook, a scary creature from children's tale but even The Babadook appearance itself wasn't much exploited and seems too mysterious. The débutant director, Jennifer Kent has successfully and smartly convinced also planted images of Babadook character at audience's mind without much showing what it really looks like and keep them guessing at the ending part. Babadook only appears couple times at shadow, sounds or some hallucinations. ",2014
7,"We are all familiar with the scenario: a young boy with an overactive imagination becomes terrified of the monster underneath his bed, and rushes to his mother for a therapeutic bedtime story. But what if this imaginary monster actually becomes real? This is the set up for a new Australian horror flick premiering at this year's Sundance Film Festival entitled The Babadook. Our protagonist, Sam, is terrified of monsters. So terrified he is loosing sleep, causing trouble in class, and creating his own sinister weaponry out of household objects as a means of defense. It's enough to drive his widowed mother, Amelia, into a frantic state of paranoia. As tensions between the two escalate, a new presence called the Babadook makes it's way into the household which questions the sanity of everyone involved. The film cleverly embraces and deconstructs typical horror film conventions in order to create something new. Though it is hilariously playful and entertaining, it's also a terrifying psychological thrill in the same vein as films like Black Swan or Rosemary's Baby. Essie Davis is great as Amelia, but newcomer Noah Wiseman gives an incredibly memorable child acting performance. If you are a horror fan looking for something new, look no further than The Babadook. Just be prepared to have nightmares afterward, and remember to leave the kiddos at home for this one.",2014

Even though I thought I knew what was coming I still found myself caught off guard. The young boy is an amazing actor, and when I learned from the Q & A after the movie how some of the scenes were filmed it made me appreciate the movie more.

Unfortunately, it suffers from all the usual tropes of horror films, without bringing anything new to the table. I found both lead actors to be particularly annoying : the always whining and screaming boy and the clinically depressed hushing mother. I couldn't care less about their fate ! As far as the monster is concerned, the director didn't bother to explain its origin, meaning or how to defeat it. As always in this case, some may like the fact that it leaves things purposefully open to interpretation, and others, like me, would have preferred if some hints were dropped here and there ! Either way, the ending is really unsatisfying and dull.",2016

3,"I really didn't enjoy The Babadook and it seemed that this feeling was shared with many in the cinema I was at. The acting, production and technical elements were good but the story and character development really let it down. There was no explanation of why the Babadook was in their house or what it's motivation was at all, which is really important in a movie with a supernatural element. Also I felt the way the supporting characters behaved to be very untrue to life and needed more back story to make their actions believable. The film was also a bit long and the ending just bizarre. The ending might have worked, again, if there was more development into why the characters were behaving the way they were. ",2014

2,"This film has no plot. I wouldn't have an issue with this if instead they had filled most of the two hours with scenes of Godzilla destroying things and killing people. However, the monster himself receives a pathetic amount of screen time, only appearing halfway through the film after the plot has already focused its attention on two giant bugs. They are unimaginatively designed, have no basis in Japanese mythology like the titular monster, and their only purpose seems to be to diminish the impressiveness of Godzilla. The character development in this film is non-existent. Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood cliché. Unlike the viewers, the film believes its characters are fascinating enough to merit the laughably corny near-death and family- reunion scenes towards the end. Instead, the audience is left laughing in bemusement at the overly sincere expressions on the protagonist's face as he threatens a giant monster with a handgun. Whenever Godzilla and the insects finally begin to fight, before anything happens there's an instant cut to yet another tedious shot of US soldiers shouting about nothing in particular. The film's sole purpose is to showcase the might of America's armed forces and ability to survive under a crisis; and it doesn't even do that well, given that the navy can't even tell when Godzilla is swimming directly under their ships. Of course, setting the story in Godzilla's homeland of Japan would not interest American viewers, so the monster decides to swim across the Pacific Ocean in order to wreak havoc. No doubt Godzilla will receive acclaim from morons due to its high-tech but utterly unimaginative animation techniques. However, this film's cutting-edge CGI does not justify its lack of plot, excitement and meaningful characters.",2014
7,"Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it.

In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen.

This new depiction of the great kaiju, acting as a reboot of the franchise and directed by an up-and-coming director, Gareth Edwards, is a very entertaining film despite the complaints of there being too little of Godzilla. I somewhat concur with this argument, however, having seen many of Japanese films, especially the original in 1954, it is known for Godzilla to be teased throughout the movie (or have limited screen time), yet still have a profound impact on the film and the audience it is delivered to, and this is what the 2014 version does very well. However, at times, it did come at an annoyance when right as we see him, the scene changes. But this should not take away from otherwise a really good film. ",2016

I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things. But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Any REAL FAN of GODZILLA will enjoy this movie and THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO MAKE IT. I cannot wait to see it again. LONG LIVE GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS!",2014
10,So I just got back from Godzilla...,2014
10,"To all the turds here that think they know what a Godzilla movie should be, and to all the so called 'critics' that couldn't enjoy a movie if they played the star role, this movie isn't supposed to be a Schindler's List or Godfather, and if it had been it WOULD have been garbage. Too bad you couldn't enjoy it because for anyone that grew up actually watching Godzilla like I DID, this movie is nothing but pure greatness and just enjoyable to experience. I'm not going to sit there and nit pick a freakin Godzilla movie for AAA acting and story lines even though I thought both were just fine here. Anyone who has to do that with a Godzilla movie shouldn't be watching ANY Godzilla movies because you have no idea how to appreciate it for what it is and ALWAYS has been.",2014
10,"I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10",2014
7,"Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!",2014
10,"As I was reading through the other reviews I noticed one thing. People have split (mostly) into two camps. In one camp you can find those that utterly hate the movie, and in the other one you find those that adore it. Weird enough, there were very little that were in between the two camps.",2014
10,This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.,2014
10,"Critics have lost their way. They have rated this film average/below average because they dislike the tease of Godzilla in the movie and say an improvement would be having him centre stage every scene he's in. When you look back to some of the greatest, most tense horror/sci-fi films like Jaws or Alien, you will see that they don't always show the creature from the start, but little snippets, building tension throughout the movie. They call this a B-movie because they enter the screening with the mindset that its cheesy because they don't understand the meaning behind Gojira itself, making it sound like just another monster movie when it's not. The fans are speaking out, showing their appreciation for the movie and love for the view Gareth is giving Godzilla, but the critics do not. Never listen to them; their opinions don't stand for the millions that actually GET what the director was trying to establish here.",2014
1,"This is the first time I've seen a movie and felt cheated  genuinely cheated and lied to! The reason is because 90% of the trailers depicted Godzilla as a threat, something to fear, the city levelling monster we all know and love. The trailers were very good at misleading me to think that it was Godzilla that made all that mess in the woods, tearing that train in half, causing that fire ball at the airport  but none of this was to be! It turns out that Godzilla is a boy scout who protects us innocent little humans when the, apparently very incompetent, Navy boys are busy miss firing their highest grade weapons at a bridge full of school buses.",2014
8,"In my opinion, this movie was insane. Godzilla was not really that much in the movie, but when he was he kicked ass!",2014
10,"I LOVED this film. The sounds and special effects and editing of it was just amazing. Godzilla was teased and then revealed extremely well. A lot of people complain that they didn't like the short amount of screen time he got, but i think it was great directing and writing! It wasn't too 'destroy everything' but it wasn't too much drama. All bad reviews of this film I've seen have been mainly because (spoiler) Bryan's character died early on which wasn't forbade in the trailer. I think the surprise of it was very good and really change up the film with that person 'who was right in the end'. I think this film was phenomenal and i wouldn't be surprised if it wins an Oscar for best special effects.",2014
10,"Old memories never die. I was living in Tokyo in 1954 the year that Godzilla first appeared and destroyed most of the City. It is something that I have never forgotten to this day. OK I know this guy is nuts. I was not even alive in 1954. I saw the Movie when it came out Thursday Night and had to sleep on it. After absorbing it all in I think I can say that I really liked the Movie and think that most Movie goers especially hard core Godzilla fans will like this Movie. Give it a shot and see what you think. I have seen every Godzilla Movie that I can get my hands on and think that this may be my favourite. Now we will have to wait and see if they will recycle any of the other Japanese Monsters. Gamera, Mothra or any others.",2014
1,"Worse film ever! save your money and don't go. Godzilla is only in the film for a maximum of 10 minutes, the rest of the 90 minutes or so, that I lost of my life, is filled with mediocre acting that was about as exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on. I got the impression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and actors, leaving the effects for Godzilla until last, which resulted in him having minimal time in the film. Literally, up until the 70 minute mark, you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back. When a headshot finally materialised, it was only for a matter of seconds. I genuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone planning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD.",2014
2,"I meant to stay home to do laundry and clip my toe nails. Compared to this movie, that would have been a click-my-heels day filled with delight and wonder. And, I would've been 10 bucks richer. After watching this disappointing, would-be flick, i had to go to confession and ask for forgiveness for being, yet again, a gullible, wasteful consumer. I said two hail Mary's and watched Pacific Rim.",2014
1,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits are impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the sickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic villains.",2014
5,"I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from ""Spiderman 3"", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. ",2014
7,"Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.",2014
8,"This movie is amazing! Acting is very fabulous and character were well portrayed by all the actors. And I must say that the ending is awesome. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an enjoyable film for Spiderman's fan, or just someone who wants to see a fun and action movie. You will laugh, you will get emotional, it has it all and at the right moment. The romance exceeds the action in the movie and it is a great blend of action and romance with comedy. The movie tells the story of Spiderman(Andrew Garfield) and Max(Jamie Foxx). Max is a person with friends and nobody cares about him. He works at Oscorp(which is an electricity generating company) as electrical engineer, which is also where Peter Parker's (Spiderman's) girlfriend Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) works. The CEO of Oscorp dies and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn(Dane DeHaan) who later on turn into Green Goblin becomes CEO of the Oscorp. He finds out he has a disease which can only be cured by Spiderman's blood. Peter worries that using his blood may kill him. At the same time, Max is involved in an accident, and turns him into Electro which is negative character in the movie. Max(Electro) wanted to be good person and help the city but misunderstood himself due to his appearance. The first fight between Spiderman and Electro, which is a memorable scene of the movie. To get the blood of Spiderman, Harry convinced the Electro to come with him which is also turning part of the movie. The design of Electro was not so good but green goblin was well made. I recommend this film to anyone else looking for an action, comedy and romantic film. To sum up, I think it is an overall excellent movie and I give The Amazing Spiderman 2,Eight out of Ten.",2014
7,"Not too bad & not too good ,that's what can I say for this movie. This movie has a nice story line,and I think I just like the visual effect. I don't like Sad Ending, actually it's not Sad Ending it just not Happy Ending. I think people like this movie because this is a sequel, so the people like this movie because they like the previously movie. And maybe the people or ""The Watchers"" like this movie because they curious about the new character. And what I want to know is, where is The Electro? well he just defeated from the battle with Spider Man and after that he's gone. So... yeah this film is Not too Bad and Not too Good.",2014
7,"I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two Raimi films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man but his Peter Parker didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.",2014
8,"SPOILERS!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!! I have Never really critiqued film before but I have seen really nothing but terrible reviews for this movie and I thought that I would do it a Solid and give it a good review. Yes it does have its flaws and a lot of them, you can't just focus on its flaws because if you watch a movie for the flaws, then what is the point of watching that certain movie? Because I could not tell you that answer.",2014

9,"I had always been (somehow) against the remake, and even with the first Amazing Spider-Man being a success, Tobey Maguire has always been the better Spiderman in my heart. I chanced upon the opportunity to watch the first Amazing movie just two months before The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Ok, I was actually forced to watch it), I can't help but compare how different the character of the two Peter Parkers (Tobey Maguire's and Andrew Garfield's) as well as the relationship between Peter Parker and his uncle (Well, I prefer the latter). Relationship-wise, it's a Peter Parker-Mary Jane versus Peter Parker-Gwen Stacey, so comparing it will be like comparing apples and oranges. Although I've got to admit the effects of the Amazing Spider-Man trilogy is much better (10 years does a lot for the CGI).",2014
8,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, only assuming the commercials had been far to revealing. Anyways...safe to say that assumption wasn't very far off. Anyways, now to speak of this in a more revealing light.",2014
9,"I was a guy who like the first film and i was thinking the same with this one, and this one is far better than the first one. It's actually come out a pretty good movie. Please don't listen the critics otherwise you will miss why Spider-man is Amazing. If you are going into this expecting a Dark Knight or an Avengers or any other movie, this isn't for you. Spider-Man is a fun character and this movie is like a comic book come to life. Certainly I am not saying that this movie is 100% perfect. There are some things about this movie which can be questioned but after watching i can say i really want to believe in superheroes. A great mix of action, humor, love and pure fun. From the story about Peter's father, over to aunt May and the love to Stacy - everything fitted so well together. End is little sad I was heart broken It killed me inside. If you're a fan of any characters in spider man, I suggest you prepare yourself mentally before watching this film, because you really should watch this film.",2014
9,"Spider-man comics and movies aren't just about the hero, but they are about the daily struggles that Peter Parker must confront and balance. In the 2nd Amazing Spider-Man film, Andrew Garfield is back at his game at being that Spider-man who is cocky, ignorant, and full of humor, but yet I am pleased to say that he still has that brilliance to make you fall into the shoes of Peter Parker and make you feel like you are still keeping things together as the world is falling apart around you.",2014

7,I LOVED the first installment of this series (more than the second) and most beautiful part about the two parts is the love story. It was a SHOCK that they had to kill the character of Gwen Stacy specially when it is Emma Stone playing it. It left me in a sad sad feeling. ,2014
8,"THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 !!!!!SPOILERS ALERT!!!! This new chapter of the Spiderman comic book character, Amazing Spiderman 2, is a solid good movie. The movie contains a considerable amount of information that is released in sequential order concerning Oscorp, the Green Goblin, and the Sinister Six.",2014

10,"I thought this movie would be like a normal Spidey movie. But surprisingly ,a unique movie.The movie has a great story never told before.Some people complain that the story doesn't make sense.But look through it carefully.It makes complete sense.Like the fact that the spider which bit Parker was made of his father's DNA ,gives us a scientific explanation of why did the spider bite work on him.",2014
10,"Let me say that I'm a huge Spider Man fan ever since I saw the original Sam Raimi trilogy and I love the early series but when I learned that there were issues in the early film series I lost interest and I never watched any of Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy again after learning about its issues. But when I heard they were rebooting it with a new director and casts along with the same production team returning to make a brand new Spider Man film I was super excited. When I saw the 2012 reboot I was surprised and I started to like the series again. Now this year when I watched The Amazing Spider Man 2 the series seem to get better and better while Raimi's films are extremely flawed forever. Marc Webb's reboot films is making good progress. I remember being at the exclusive premiere of this film in IMAX back in April 30 me and my sister hit the exclusive late screening of the film which is at 11:55 pm to 2:00 am in the morning and when we watched it I was super amazed with it and I so love the new Spider Man film its even better than the previous films because this film like Spider Man 3 because the film has too many characters from the comic books where as Spider Man 3 failed due to the presence of too many characters from the comics and less screen time for the villains like Venom who was 2 or 3 minutes only in the film The Amazing Spider Man 2 worked a lot more even though there are way too many characters from the comics it managed to stay in the proper direction in terms of character development and introducing new characters even though this movie is way too rushed than Spider Man 3 because when we get to see a bunch of new characters Marc Webb seriously handled everything very well unlike Raimi who seriously worked way too hard and failed when the third Spider Man film was released Webb did a slightly better job than how Raimi worked on his films. One of the film's main highlights of course is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone and it gives the movie a very good feel something the Sam Raimi's films failed to do and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry will always be better than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's chemistry in the early films also the new villain Electro is amazing and the design of Electro is superb and it is way better than the Lizard's design in the first film. Plus one of the other film's highlights is the CGI and special effects which is always the highlight of the Spider Man films even in the Sam Raimi trilogy(The Sandman special effects are my personal favorite in the early films)but I love the special effects here way better and I would say that The Amazing Spider Man 2 has the best special effects in the series since Spider Man 2 and 3. OK it maybe rushed and flawed but they are easy to forget once you see the movie's highlights which are extremely unstoppable in the film and will keep you glued to the screen until the end and while we did see a couple of characters that we've seen before like the Osborn family what's great about reintroducing the early characters from the early films is that they are not only portrayed by new actors who give a stunning and amazing plus mesmerizing performance but I love how they are given a darker back story than in the early films. Overall The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a great sequel to the 2012 reboot and is a major improvement also to its predecessor in terms of character development, special effects, designs and stunning visuals and this is where the series get to expand where we are introduced to a lot of new characters and learn a lot more about the characters and I'm hoping that The Amazing Spider Man 3 and the spin offs will expand the Spider Man universe a bit more and have bigger and better fights.",2014

8,As a huge fan of the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Maguire I remember watching the reboot with Andrew Garfield and being far from impressed. I wished they never rebooted and just continued with Maguire under the suit.,2014
9,"As a fan of Marvel, Spider-Man is one of their best in my opinion. The comics are great, the film adaptations, however, I'm not that fond of. Spider-Man was just OK, Spider-Man 2 was flawless, Spider-Man 3 was really bad, and The Amazing Spider-Man was good, but not memorable. I walked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some reviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic, and is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was surprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew Garfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special effects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging scenes and Electro's skin. I have an issue with Paul Giamatti's performance as Aleskei Systevech/Rhino and the Sony marketing, but TAS2 is still very awesome and underrated. Even my mom enjoyed it, who doesn't like Spider-Man! Surprisingly, there was applause at the end, so the audience must have liked it.",2015
8,"Great power doesn't just come with great responsibility but also at a great cost. Heroes deal with their painful pasts and yet rise to face the evil that can threaten the present day. It is their ability to overcome those personal battles in times when darkness looms over society, that makes them superheroes. In the follow-up to the reboot of Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, director Marc Webb (!) massively improvises upon the story's technological rendering and the human element of it that delineates the challenges of being a superhero for an ordinary man. Peter Parker's ability to overcome his fears, his childhood loss, his financial instability and relationship's complication is what really makes him the Amazing Spiderman and in its 2nd installment, his portrayal by Andrew Garfield outclasses any prior attempt. At the burden-heavy core of his responsibility web is Emma Stone's charming Gwen Stacy who is perhaps the most lovable superhero girlfriend yet. ",2014

Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing. One question did the leads fast for their roles or was CGI used to give the impression of their skeletal frames.The ariel dog fights did use use computer enhancement as did the plane crash.I found this movie much more watchable than the much praised""American Sniper""",2015
7,Unbroken (2014),2015
2,!May contain Spoilers!,2014
3,"***May Contain Spoilers*** The story of Louis Zamperini is only half told in Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken."" After watching a screening of this film I did a little internet research on Mr. Zamperini and found that his life post-war, in my opinion, was equally emotional, meaningful and film worthy as his POW years. This film, while beautifully shot, lacked the true depth of Zamperini's life. In the beginning of the film, Angelina Jolie goes overboard in showing the viewer his early life and his Olympic journey. Next up are the war years and POW torture. The End. In addition to not feeling anything toward Zamperini's chief brutalizer, the torture scenes were way too long. After a few scenes viewers will get the point that this man went through Hell. What happens after the war is where the real story begins and where ""Unbroken"" stops. Louis Zamperini's struggles continued for quite some time until he found God. This new journey took him back to Japan where he sought out his captors and forgave them. However, his nemesis, the Bird, did not want to meet him...but Zamperini tried. I would have liked to see more of Zamperini's post-war PTSD struggle as this is such a relevant topic today, culminating with his will to forgive which ultimately saved him. For those who are only interested in Zamperini as an Olympian and POW, then you will appreciate this film. I found this film failed to address the full life of Louis Zamperini and felt his wikipedia entry would have been a better guide for Jolie.",2014
2,"Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about. Read the book - it will give you the emotion and satisfaction you are entitled to from this survival story.",2015
1,"I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. Granted the acting was very good, however, it was the longest 2 hours of my life. I kept waiting for something 'good' to happen and it never did. I believe this could have been a wonderful American story, but was nothing short of a huge let down. Really disappointed in how much this movie was hyped up. Painfully slow, and felt like two hours of literal purgatory. I am sure that his true story was much better and could have emphasized what his family was going through at the same time. Or possible they could have shown what the news had reported about him, and what the airforce was doing to look for him. Wish I could erase this one from my memory. The worst part is I feel this man was done a real disservice to his memory and honor.",2014
7,"When I first heard about this film, I got really excited about the story but the mix reviews had me walking into the theater ready to nitpick. ",2015
5,"Review: Man, this film is long and it felt like it was never going to end. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is touching and it's amazing what these war veterans had to go through, but Angelina Jolie could have jazzed it up a little. A whole hour is spent with them at sea and then you've got another hour with them stuck in prison camps. I would have liked to have seen the aftermath of what the soldiers had to go through because it dragged after a while and I struggled to stay awake. The inspiring Olympic athlete, Louis, was played well by Jack O'Connell and some of the scenes were extremely emotional. The actions scenes at the beginning of the film, seemed quite real and the whole look and feel of the movie was great but I just couldn't take the length of the whole thing. The scenes when they were eating the fish on the dingy and when Louis was constantly getting picked on by the prison warden, we're touching and it's hard to believe that they ended up in such a predicament because the plane was faulty. Anyway, I personally was expecting a better film from Angelina Jolie who had a great concept to work with so it has to go down as a disappointment from me.",2015
7,"During the World War II, the bombardier Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his torture and inspiring his mates in the camp. ",2016
8,"Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it.",2015
5,"Just came out of a pre-release screening. It was fine. Above all, the word I would use would be ""safe"". It was a movie created not to fail, and it doesn't. Watching it is a reasonable way to spend 2 and a half hours. A bunch of bad stuff happens to Zamperini, he survives it in an inspiring way, the end.",2014
3,"very poor compared to the book or the true story this film should have been an epic, no depth, so much was missed out extremely disappointing, I'm pleased I have read the book so I could get a true representation of this mans endeavour. There are so many characters brought to life in the book, Miss Jollie couldn't even bring the lead roll to life just like her acting. What a shame, this man was a true maverick before during and after the war, seems like she had the budget and the actors just no direction. Stories like this can inspire internationally and be timeless in the right hands, this film will be forgotten very quickly unless you've read the book and for those whom have had the privilege of living the story and knowing the characters through the book will remember the film for its grievous contempt and sacrilege to what the human spirit can endure.",2015
3,"Although it is an exceptional story in it's own right, the film fails to dazzle or inspire as the book did. It never fully materializes into the epic experience it wants to be. The script was problematic from the get-go. Attributing a mans extremely brutal POW experience with a spiritual awakening and strength in God does not translate well on the big screen. Blending those two subject matters together in a seamless way while maintaining the violent theme that the director imposes on the audience just doesn't work. This films tries to be too many things so naturally it fails to be anything. You cant please everyone.The buzz over the last two years promoting this film really boosted my expectations. Only to feel extremely let down and honestly, conned. Perhaps it was a lack of budget or the lack of talent behind the screen. On screen the talent was impressive and I think we have found a new budding star in newcomer Jack O'connell. Very impressive indeed.",2014
4,How was it possible to make such an compelling and inspiring life story into such a boring movie despite sharks and torture? Go figure.,2014
1,"I was very disappointed in what should have been, hands down, an Oscar contender. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because the direction absolutely ruined this film, which misses the point of the book altogether. Laura Hildebrand's wonderful book immediately reaches the reader's heart as she connects Louie Zamperini's life story of growing up from a kid headed towards a life of crime to becoming a man who not only survived the most unbelievable odds but also how the human spirit can sustain anything, if wanted. Never during the two + hours does the viewer get to know the character, or his friends, family and comrades-in-arms. Maybe Ms. Jolie should have spent more time reading the book and trying to understand the emotional connect the book had with its readers than planning all her promotional interviews and short documentaries which focused only on her and how fortunate she was to have been chosen to direct the film. It's not about you, Angelina, it was about a remarkable life and humanity, and you missed it all.",2014
6,"I have been looking forward to this movie, having loved the book and admiring Louis Zamperini like so many others. While the movie was well-crafted and well-acted, it failed to blow me over emotionally. It's one movie that could have been longer, while at the same time tightening up the POW sequence by at least 15 minutes. ",2014
1,"I could not WAIT for this movie to come out. I ""listened"" to the book on my drive out west and it was started the day Louie Z passed away which made reading this book even more intense. I was hoping the movie would cast the same spell over me but it only really addressed one aspect of his life and I felt it was a HUGE MISS. It missed so many other areas that were just as fascinating. The dialogue was almost non-existent as well. It was almost like watching Castaway but with violence. Sorry Angelina you missed the boat! ",2014
3,"While this movie purported to tell the story of Mr. Zamperini, who doubtless was a Great American Hero, his character was left undeveloped in the movie. Sadly the only person we got to know in this movie was Wantabe, his nemesis.",2014
2,"Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is far too ambitious. She obviously tried to win an Oscar for that one thinking all Hollywood WWII tales are instant award winning movies. The problem with Unbroken is that Angelina Jolie is a really bad storyteller. The movie drags for the first hour and a half, with the story showing how Zamperini survived in the pacific. While it is necessary to show how he survived the ordeal, the way Angelina told the story is boring and completely uninteresting. The cast is also lacking, and borderline amateurish, lacking any emotional impact on the viewers. Jack O'Connell (Zamperini) is not suited at all for the main role. The final scene in which he carries the heavy wooden log over his head is far fetched and borderline Hollywood fiction. Unbroken is ultimately broken on all parts. This 140 min motion picture is a pain to watch, and ironically the only redeeming parts remotely interesting to me was the final cut of the movie that shows the real Zamperini carrying the Olympic torch in Nagano's 1998 Winter games. Save your money and skip this one.",2015
10,"I finally rented this movie which I had been avoiding since it was released over a year ago. I am glad I did because it kept my interest throughout. I thought the POW theme would be too depressing which it is but there is no glossing over that. Angelina Jolie has become an admirable director. I don't understand the hate directed towards her. This is an epic movie that is very well done. The film has won it's fair share of awards including three Oscar nominations. The acting is great. I am surprised the movie didn't receive more Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Supporting Actor & Best Director. Also the Coen Brothers should have received more recognition for their screenplay",2015
4,"When I finished this book a few years ago I thought to myself, ""What a great HBO miniseries this book would make"". When I heard they were making a film, I thought ""No way. You can not tell this story in 2 or even 3 hours - not without cutting out too many important pieces.""",2014
9,"Lets just say I just saw a great movie about loyalty, courage, survival and redemption. Angelina Jolie has fantastic directing skills and its Oscar worthy. Jack O'Connell knocks his performance out of the park and he's proved himself with this great performance along with his performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71"". He embodies the characteristics of Louis Zamperini and the great wonderful life he lived. Jai Courtney had a small role, but really good surprisingly, can't wait to see him as Kyle Reese in next summer's Terminator reboot. The movie slowed at a point but picked it up and blew me away, O'Connell gives an Oscar worthy performance, but given the competition it's unlikely. Who cares though? This is one of 2014's best films and you'll see it at the Oscars I promise you that.",2014
9,"This seems to be a very nice comedy... i have seen a couple of episodes, they are fun, they are original, it does remind me of some older comedies, but at the same time it is quite refreshing. The acting and directing is good, the writing is nice, the budget is obviously seriously low but however they managed to create something really cute! will be watching for sure ! just hoped they would make these comedy shows last a bit longer than twenty two minutes.. Why do we only get 22 minutes of laughter and always 45 minutes of drama drama drama.. This is frustrating..! Anyway, as I was saying, if you are looking for a nice new comedy series for summer, you should totally check this one out.",2014
10,A hilarious vessel for Emily Osment (always has been one of my favorites). Emily gets to show herself as the young adult that she is now and Y&H is filled with adult innuendo (as I said - Emily is no kid anymore and the rest of the world is all the better for it).,2015
3,"I haven't been able to watch more than a few episodes, but I also don't intend to. So far it seems like this show is a cheap Melissa & Joey knock-off, with the genders reversed. ",2016
10,"Best sitcom in many many years, it would be a shame if it is not continued. The main quality for a sitcom is to be credible, to deal with real life. If it concerns hypothetical situations, it becomes artificial and unconvincing. So far, only three sitcoms worked for me: M*A*S*H, Married with Children and Taxi. 'Young and Hungry' is a worthy addition to the pile. It is spontaneous, exhibited and sparkling. You really feel that you are part of the plot, because the plot is tangible enough for you to blend in. Enjoyment, effervescence, wit, it has them all. It just reinvented the sitcom, a genre undermined by ill-fated precedents such as 'Friends' or 'Seinfeld', meant for pea brain viewers. Absolutely brilliant.",2014
8,"This is funny and good wrapped up in one package. It stars one of my favorites Emily osment. A young ""chef blogger"" gets a job as a chef at a rich tech's home.One night she accordantly slept with him.OOPS!!!! There's also a lot of funny moments,a fake pregnancy,a relationship with a car and a very funny love triangle. Let's not forget Yolanda(the housekeeper)and Elliot(the organizer) those two are hilarious. Give it a look its laughoutloud funny!!!!!!!Abc family really shows good shows I am happy that this got a second season bc its not easy to get one many shows gets canceled after a couple episodes!!!!",2015
4,"No. Call it a shtick, call it a spoof, I have no idea what audience this show is trying to appeal to. The humor is pure cliché sitcom with its ""likable"" funny poor girl. Emily Osment's Disney roots, Hannah Montana, shares level of maturity with her new show except that most of the jokes are based on tacky lines on sexual tension. The plot is completely predictable and shallow. If this was some genius retaliation on Disney's TV shows from former Disney stars, then I applaud. They definitely also desperately try to chase today's popular trends while not understanding any of this material that's in their scripts. The crap acting doesn't help either. So far Yolanda is the only one who is surprisingly believable to me. Now since this clearly not for mature adults and clearly not for children what audience is this for? Teenagers and young adults? Well, I am not trying to represent all teenagers, but as a teenager I find this show annoying and stupid. The whole conflict of this show is booze and questionably work ethics.",2015
1,Barely funny and dull and found myself thinking of something else when I was watching this stupid show.,2015
10,THERE WILL BE SPOILERS...YOU WERE WARNED!!!!,2014
9,This is the definition of a great sitcom. ,2015
10,"I love Emily Osment since I perceived her as a small gem with her presence on Hannah Montana; there and then I sincerely thought she did all the job, or, let's say she was more spontaneous and natural than the main character. After I watched a few times all the Hannah series, I felt that Emily deserved more, that she could show more, only if she had a chance. I am very thankful because this chance came for her and because I got to see her develop and show more from her potential and the qualities an actor should have: spontaneity, humor, good presence and rapport between the other members of the cast, and lack of falseness. I am not a movie expert, and I talk from the heart when I say that the Y&H series is very entertaining, because the more episodes I see, the better the cast gets together, harmonizes itself and deliver very good jokes and plausible situations, and we also can learn some educational stuff, too. The entire cast does an amazing job, Emily's self-deprecation humor is very funny, without falling into dark, so I like everything I see. Keep up the best work and from me to you, Emily: I am very glad that you have received this chance (I am mostly sure that more will come for you, from the smart directors) and hope only the best for you, since you have lots to give to the audience! She will be one of the greats, someone, mark my words! (P.S.: sorry for all the ""I""s)",2015
6,"This is going to come off very sexist, and I'm probably starting a fight here. ",2016
8,The show started out awkward at first but after awhile I began to really enjoy it. It's actually really funny. Still a very clichéd sitcom but it works. It's something light and fun with an outrageous side. Besides I cannot wait to see the show play out. After watching one episode I could see where they were heading and the more I watch the more invested I get.,2015
9,"I never had doubts that this show would rock, but the series exceeded my expectations! To me, this is pure perfection, there are so few series of this type that really are funny, well written and acted, and Young & Hungry is part of that glorious list. It's different, refreshing, funny and you can play with this series for years and seasons, the story and plot is not limited or weak, you can add this and that. For some reason it's in his second season, actually Season 2B, and I'm so freaking happy that this show is back. Believe me, it's worth it watching it, every single episode put a big smile in my face, I'm never sad or bored while watching the series.",2015
7,"So this stars the other actress from the Hannah Montana show. She's quite likable, but she's a caricature, similar to the Disney show. The gay Asian assistant and the black maid are also caricatures. He's reprising his role in Entourage, and they both do a good low brow job. The male lead is OK, but the least interesting of the bunch. He has an evil, status conscious girlfriend who's actress is pretty good.",2014
9,"OK, this is not the worst thing that ABC Family has put out. In the beginning I wasn't so sure - but after watching the Pilot I totally changed my mind. It had instant laughs, and jumped completely in and got the story going right away!!! I loved that!!! Sure it has cheese moments and a few lame jokes - but I seriously laugh out loud at every episode! The car episode killed me - we've all had that clunker car - and some of the stuff that happened was SO familiar!! There's definitely some good comedy in there! Yolanda kills me! And I love Sophia! I totally enjoy this show! ",2014
1,"Worst piece of trash i have ever seen, after seeing the pilot i wanted to dig out my eyes so i wont risk seeing a second more of this trash.",2015
7,this is my first review so forgive me if i suck at this.,2014
5,"Because the pilot caption stated ""Hungry blogger needing gourmet food work..."" I decided to give it a shot, as I am a seasoned writer/blogger and journalist. ",2015
10,"I love this show even my husband like it. I've watch every season 3 times already I can't wait for the next season. It not only has romance women but it has comedy for men and women. I got so hooked I had a marathon and was up for 36 hours. I will be watching all the seasons again I'm sure. Please don't cancel this show, I want to see more Gabby and even Elliot.",2017
7,Really have not seen much of this show just some reruns on cable or you tube clips and some old episodes on demand. Still the thing that caught my eye was the cute and sexy little sweet Emily Osment who's the eye candy of the show! Overall the show is fun and sexy Emily Osment is Gabi a young in her 20's food blogger who's hired by Josh a young tech in the city by the bay(San Francisco) to be his own personal chef. And these episodes become more and more on the adventure front in the form of learning life and relationships. As plenty of casual sex between the sheets is seen between Gabi and Josh as they each still try for love. And Emily is so cute and sexy some eye candy as many scenes in the series I saw her wearing very sexy colored bras! Overall funny and sexy little series that's a feel good watch to kill some minutes!,2017
9,I don't know if this is a spoiler or not but if you don't like repetitive topics or whatever than this show is not for you. ,2017
4,The first few episodes had a bit of promise. We have a young chef with some talent that falls into bed drunkenly with a tech mogul and then has to navigate a new job with the tension of that background. ,2017
7,"It's pretty easy to review this one. If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat. It holds up to the expectations and plays cleverly with 'being aware' of making basically the same movie again. The good thing about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some surprises and good action. I basically laughed from the first minute up to the (awesome!) end credits! If you like that type of comedy, this one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the funniest flick this year so far! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and you can see and feel, how they enjoyed doing this movie. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or professors for that matter). Everyone who's been to college can relate to those stereotypes (e.g. the pseudo intellectuals, the sport jocks, the art students etc.) and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""The Lego Movie"") do a great job spoofing those clichés while at same time debunk the downsides and shallowness of those groups or college life in general. ",2014
1,I have never seen such a bad movie like this one. The script is a huge load of illogical and absurd events which in the end collapse together into am anti-climax ending. And the acting even manages to out-worsen the completely trashy plot. Every actors and actresses in this film seem to worry that the audiences might not be able to hear them clearly so they just yelled at a maximum volume and it was not pleasant at all! The the slap-tick humor could have been able to save this film from becoming a total disaster but frankly it didn't work at all.,2014
1,"How on Earth is this film rated so highly? There's no true wit or intelligence within the script, it's just stupid, lame jokes & a lot of unnecessary swearing which the movie seems to think is funny. I'm not saying swearing doesn't have a place in film, but overusing them to this extent is extremely noticeable & came across as childish.",2014
7,"All these reviews are bashing the crap out of this movie. 'It's aimless drivel and only for mindless idiots'. Well....Yeah. When I watch a comedy like this that's what I hope for. Sometime you just want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half and watch two familiar ""actors"" play out ridiculous but easy enough to grasp scenarios while they foolishly react. A post-viewing critique is pointless because the directors have no intention of it being able to hold up on creative or any kind of artistic merit. If you want to think about what you're watching, or enjoy good story development, or simply see some great acting then there are plenty of movies like Rashomon, Eraserhead, The Man from Earth, Memories of Murder, Hitchcock films, Miyszaki films, or something like Life Is Beautiful or It's A Wonderful Life(I forget which is which, both great). And there's nothing wrong with a good documentary know and then either. But something good and properly stupid can be just the right thing when you need to take a respite. Not all comedies are going to be a quipping Woody Allen flicks. It's really about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right one for your current mood. In other words this movie is just what it intends to be and just what wanted it to be. Pure and easy entertainment.",2014
1,"Loaded with potential, 22 JUMP STREET is the sequel to the comedic buddy teamup (based on the 1980's Johnny Depp TV show) where Christopher Tatum and Jonah Hill posed as high schoolers to bust a drug dealer Not only did it score at the box office, 21 JUMP STREET was actually really funny and involving, and the duo made a fantastic polar opposite team.",2014
10,"11 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 22 Jump Street. This film was a hoot!!! I only watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend in preparation for the sequel and although I enjoyed it I have to say the sequel was much better. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a great double act and the film provides just the right amount of slapstick humour combined with witty banter and the serious side of undercover police work. Imagine if you will two undercover cops, not the brightest pair, sent back to college to infiltrate the latest drug ring. Whatever you are imagining.....it's in this sequel. Hill and Tatum are tight.....they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution.......Spring Break. A giggle from start to finish and Channing Tatum's not bad to look at either. Stay for the credits!!!!",2014
8,Quickie Review:,2014
8,"Keeping this brief, this is no doubt the funniest film I've seen since the turn of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing ""Ride Along"", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.",2014
2,I mean seriously. This used to be a respected site that gave people who didn't know much films insight into the greatest films and audience ratings for every film they've ever watched. 8.0. Dammit IMDb users. ,2014
7,"Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22 Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series.",2014
1,"I swear, sometimes I'm too optimistic. Even though ""21 Jump Street"" is one of my least favorite movies and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I felt obligated to see ""22 Jump Street"" and went through with it because I thought this time around they may of had something. While ""22 Jump Street"" is better than ""21 Jump Street"", though that isn't hard for any movie to do, it still suffers from the same problems as the first and has some elements to it that even surpasses ""21 Jump Street"" in awfulness.",2014
1,"Please, allow me to save you the time, money, and effort associated with watching this terrible film. I totally enjoyed the 1st, and had high hopes for something at least mildly entertaining... nope. I was bored to the point of incapacitation and Redditing on my phone. In fact, the attempts at being funny and dialog decisions made by the director and production staff were just sad. I honestly do feel that ANYONE could have done this movie better, and laugh at the notion of someone actually spending millions of dollars to make this.. and then I realize that the movie was profitable, and that there is no hope for the human race.",2014
7,"First of all, big complements to the protagonists. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity.",2014
2,"This film packs just a few good jokes in a full 112 minutes of bad, naive, trivial, vulgar and infantile ones. You will experience moments of real embarrassment for being supposed to laugh at such a crap. Believe me, if you're not a teen still struggling your way out through high school (or maybe even younger), this movie is definitely not for you. I think even a college freshman would find it simplistic and not so funny. The two cops relation development is so obvious, so trivial, it can't really make up for the entire film, as it is supposed to do instead. While their investigation (and action scenes) is relegated to the background. On top of that those action scenes seem to be taken directly from a 90s teen B-movie, not even near to be realistic or engaging. Both Hill and Tatung are capable of much better performances (as they already showed), they should begin to choose better script. Not worth watching, really.",2014
10,"When I was about to give up on modern comedies, here comes a sequel that outdoes the original ten times or more. Tatum is excellent as the slowest of the pair, proving he's a very good comedian, both physically and delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie, and his partner, Hill, redeems himself from the depths of ""Wolf"" with a turn that shows how talented he can be. His multidimensional geek fully forms a perfect whole with the physical and sweet jock turn by Tatum.",2014
1,Really IMDb? 7.4? How how how. Having read some other reviews clear some folks are getting paid to write positive feedback. Some reviews talk about laughing non-stop all the way through - that is simply not possible. ,2014
4,"Review: I know that I'm going to be the only person in the world saying this, but I really didn't find this movie that funny. The jokes were really weak, along with the storyline which wasn't that great either. I liked the chemistry between the two characters but I found it silly and a bit over the top. Basically, these two misfits have to find out who is selling this new drug called WhyPhy, in a college. Tatum's character becomes best friends with a fellow college student who he plays football with, which jeopardises his relationship with Jonah's character. It isn't the greatest storyline and I did lose interest after a while, but the acting from these two accomplished actors keeps the movie going. Personally, I was quite disappointed after all of the hype surrounding the film. ",2014
1,"If I could give this movie zero or minus 10, I'd surely do that, unfortunately IMDb doesn't provide such a possibility.",2014
1,"The American humor is sooooo bad and on such low level that its basically like walking into a kindergarten in Europe, its about the same level. Is this really what the people there like? Somehow i don't think so, i just think they are fed this crap so often that its useless to resist. no one above the age of 14 can like this, i would be amazed if that was the case. Why does everything has to be so overblown in their comedies? I don't get it, people aren't that stupid, try to make quality comedies again, if your capable of that. I didn't finish it, was impossible to do.",2014
1,I'll keep this brief...this movie was awful. Just awful. ,2014
7,"If there's one criticism I have about 22 Jump Street, it's that the movie feels too similar to 21 Jump Street. But is that really a complaint? With 22 Jump Street, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie) have created a massively entertaining ride, with more antics from the characters we love, and better performances all around.",2014
3,Adolescent and puerile. Nothing wrong with that if you are a puerile adolescent. I am not. I am older. But surely a good comedy should appeal to all age groups. This one is dependent on the audience being puerile. Jonah Hill is a very good actor. He should find grown up parts in grown up movies. There were good elements though like the throw away lines of the girl engaged in a gun fight and the young adult-speak in humorous situations. But really? This seemed to entertain those around me in the audience more than I thought was warranted; so there you go it must be me not everybody else. I notice it got a lot of rave reviews on this site so don't let my menopausal negativity get to you. Take no notice of me because you might like it. I am probably wrong and the other reviewers who thought it was good perhaps were right. If you are over 40 don't bother. If you are over 50 definitely don't bother. If you are still older just accept that it is a young person's world and read some Shakespeare. Still I think Jonah Hill is an excellent actor. I would go to see him in anything.,2014
6,"It was exactly what I expected from start to finish. Not something that I was at all interested in. There wasn't any hilarious parts that grabbed my attention. It was as if the took the plot from 21 Jumpstreet, did some role reversal, and threw in some twists to throw you off. I knew exactly who the mastermind was as soon as they were introduced. It's as if you weren't suppose to suspect that it was the one person that didn't have a huge role. The comedy wasn't horrible. But it wasn't anything out of the ordinary either. I'm not a huge Jonah Hill fan. I don't find him funny. He's whiny in every movie he plays in. And he's super annoying. He needs to find another persona to take on in his next film. Just the uttering of his name makes me not want to ever watch another movie he has even the smallest part in.",2014
1,"I have never left a review, mainly because of the stupid 10 lines minimum that is required by IMDb. Why can't we say what we want in a few words?? I don,t understand.",2014
10,"In the ocean of animes, you find only a few gems. Most of them are roughs, but this one is cut.",2014
10,"Out of all the Anime i have ever watched this is one hundred percent my favorite.I definitely recommend this to everyone and would love to see it get more attention.One reason i recommend this is that the characters are great (especially Ban and Elizabeth).Another reason is that the music is beautiful especially the opening,(Netsujō no Spectrum)i cant stop listening to it. Also i have to say that the animation is great. Lastly i cant not mention the story which has lots of moments which surprise you but they are spaced just so there not to common or rare.So over all this is an amazing anime which i believe deserves a ten out of ten rating.",2015
9,"~*!Make sure to watch each episode from the very beginning(before the opening song) and also after the ending song! If you skip it or let Netflix auto play you WILL miss content and backstory of the show!!*~ So I saw this on Netflix and a friend watched it and bugged the crap out of me to watch it, so i did. I was not disappointed, it had everything i look for in a ""good/decent"" anime. To start things off one of the main characters is a talking animal which is hilarious, he's one of the best characters from any show not just one of the typical ""animal characters"". If your into the typical shounen animes like ""Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece"", etc its a given, you ARE going to enjoy this show. Now to start it off i love the animation and the artwork, the world the show takes place in is beautiful it completely immerses you into that ""fairy tale"" type atmosphere with the forests everywhere and all the mysteries of the world itself. The fight scenes are awesome, completely over powered, over the top fighting. The story is very straight and to the point right from go, and that in a way kind of makes the show feel a little shallow & rushed but it works for it & I still think its one of the better shows. I do wish they would of drug the show out just a little more though, I feel that would of given it more of an emotional bond & room for more details making it not as ""empty?"" feeling(not sure if thats the correct word to describe what i mean but i think you'll understand after watching it). The music is amazing! Both the opening and ending themes are all really enjoyable and can be listened to over and over again and the music & sounds during the show are great and all match well. I love the voice acting for the English dub, I thought they were all great and everyone matched very well. Every single character is great, from the main crew to the side characters they're all fun and a really good cast. At the time of writing this their is currently two OVA episodes which i highly recommend watching if you enjoyed the series as they both shed details to the story that you probably don't want to miss out on & are funny as well.",2015
9,"Writing is very good. The story hooks you in and, at the end of each episode, I wanted to know what happened next. BTW, it took me a few episodes before I caught on that there was usually a short scene, *after* the end credits of each episode, that was relevant to the storyline. ",2015
9,"I love this show! This is a great show, in my opinion, for teens and adults, not children though. The way the story starts off is very good and the action only increases every episode! I think anyone who likes Magi ,and battle anime in general, would really enjoy watching this. I love the plot and the speed that the story moves, although, like most anime, there are some warnings to heed. My first warning is that if you are uncomfortable watching scenes with perverted (for humor) actions, this may not be a good anime because the main character can be a little perverted towards a somewhat ignorant / naive girl he travels with. Secondly, the main character's other traveling companion, a pig, swears a lot, and seems particularly fond of calling the bad guys profane names. Blood is a regular occurrence, but violence is everywhere and that's why I don't suggest this for kids younger than maybe about 13, depending on how mature they are. Hope this helps!",2016
3,"If you haven't seen shounen, you will most likely give it a pass. If you have, you will most likely recognize ""strong influences"" through the whole thing, it amazes me how every single second of it seems to mimic better preexisting pieces of animation, like a bland colash with a slightly different flavour to it. It has every annoying trope we are tired of and feeds from every well known shounen and that's about it, it does not bring anything new. It ain't that bad, but you have shows like HxH, One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, JoJo's bizarre adventures, Claymore, FMA: Brotherhood... just to name a few, and unlike them this show just does not stand out.",2017

Couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why Netflix recommended it to me or it came with such a high rating. Then, after having it pop up in some lists a few more times, I decided to sit through one more time. A few more episodes in and I was hooked!",2016
4,"Classic shounen without any original content. The characters are so basic, a lot of events can be foreseen. The fan service is pretty awful too. Elizabeth just seem to not care when she's getting harassed by Meliodas. It could have been interesting if there was some dramatic scenes but ZERO PROTAGONIST died during the whole show ! Even Veronica who was supposed to be dead miraculously resurrected due to Elizabeth overpowered magic. A lot of important things like the sacred weapons are left unexplained. How did Ban get his nunchaku back ??? How can Gowther survive after he ( or she ? ) got his head chopped of ??? The only good character in my opinion is Hawk who brings some fun to the show. However some backstories are pretty well written but there are ruined by bad characters in my opinion. I also don't see the relation between the animal and the sins... Wrath with dragon, OK why not but greed with fox ? Anyway , I just feel that the whole universe is not credible... Way too much important things left unexplained and way too much clichés.",2017

1,"I tried to put this in the parents' guide but could not access it. Episode 1 has a young man grope and sniff a woman while she is unconscious. In Episode 2, he boasts about stealing panties and groping the boobs of over 1000 girls. In episode 3, he gropes the girl again (at least she's awake this time) with no warning to her (let alone consent), and looks like he's fingering her. Later, it becomes clear that he was stealing her panties (not sure how...) and returns them to her. Now, I don't have a problem with sexuality or nudity and adults can watch what they want. But this show appeals to young boys (my 9 year old wanted to watch) and it plays right into the objectification of women and rape culture. There are also undertones of BDSM, which I thought were hilarious, but I'm not about to discuss this with my 9 year old! In short, this show does nothing to model healthy consensual sexuality to either boys or girls. Boo.",2017

10,"First of all, the pilot of this is just outstanding. I couldn't stop binge-watching since the beginning. Basically, the story is about a kingdom, known by Liones (which is located inside the Brittania- clearly a reference to the ancient Britain) , where the peace and justice were/are kept by the holy knights. Those warriors are very powerful, according to anime one of them capable of facing one hundred of men. Politically, Liones was unstable due to the weakening of the King and also the attempts of some of the holy knights at developing new powers for themselves. Alongside this situation, there were the especial once holy knights, the seven deadly sins; those sins, who are actually the most powerful holy knights all around Brittania, were accused of trying to take the King down, implying a war between the other holy knights and these seven deadly sins. It turned out that the seven deadly sins didn't have any fault in what happened in that attempt against the king. However, this bad fame still stands even ten years later (the actual time of that story). There is much more interesting details about that story. But what is more interesting is the whole development through its 24 episodes in the first season and there is still plenty of unanswered questions which I hope will be answered in the next season.",2016

In this fantasy world, about ten years ago, a whole group of Knights were slaughtered by the Seven Deadly Sins, and the king was killed. Ten years have past, and the holy knights are still on the hunt for the Seven Deadly Sins. The story soon starts us off with a little guy serving food and drinks in his bar, but people talking about the seven deadly sins gets them a bit tense, and soon after words, a knight comes in, saying the seven deadly sins, everyone runs out like they smelled a fart. Soon the person in the armor falls and it comes apart showing a female, she soon says she is looking for the seven deadly sins to the little guy, but it turns out that he is Meliodas, the leader of the seven deadly sins. They soon head out on a journey to look for the rest of the deadly sins, and they will find out about a dark plan that is in the capitol.",2016

10,"This show starts off pretty slow for a couple of episodes as it sort of staggers when all the main characters start showing up. The show is very good. The music is amazing, and always changes every few episodes, while keeping the same feeling. The characters are extremely memorable, they all are different aspects of the 7 deadly sins, and thus creating very differing and interesting dynamics between the characters. The story, while sometimes admittedly cheesy, is extremely good and has lots of meaning to it. I was severely depressed before watching this show, but this show really portrayed the beauty of life, the grimness, and the silliness all in a perfect balance that really keeps things interesting throughout every single episode. I would highly recommend giving this show a watch, it's truly something special.",2017

You know what you are going to get, the freaky children and the inevitable romance. I like these two when there together and I like Sandler despite what the critics say. He is someone you can relate to. A great movie to chill out, relax or just something to make you happy. ",2014
9,"The lower ratings on this film are too harsh. This is actually a sweet comedy where two individuals who initially repel each other grow to like each other. The added touches are the children in this film, who are not only hilarious but also bring out the parental qualities in Drew and Sandler's characters. ",2014
9,"If you can believe it, we loved it. Don't care what the critics say, obviously. But you know why they hate it. Stubbornly suburban, vaguely sexist, more like sketch comedy lacking a finely crafted story arc, and definitely an unashamedly traditionalist pro-family view of ""boys need dads and girls need moms."" So that's Sandler's POV. You can go to the art house to see witty, urbane and progressive films (and we do) or to the multiplex to see the endless parade of horror, action, YA and/or comic book dumb dumb fare. (and we don't) But I'm still glad there's room in this world for Adam Sandler movies. Because they're funny and human.",2014
8,"Went to this movie a little leery because of the reviews and because I haven't loved all of Adam Sandler's movies. I was very surprised to find that I laughed nearly the whole movie. I thought Adam and Drew Barrymore did a great job together. All of the supporting cast was hilarious, especially Kevin Nealon and his ""wife,"" and Terry Crews, who cracked me up every single scene he was in. Some of the scenes were a bit emotional, and even these scenes teared me up a little bit, thought all the acting was well done. The Africa setting was beautiful and the scenes in the hotel were gorgeous.",2014
9,"After a couple of very bad recent movies, finally Adam Sandler did what he is doing the best. A family movie with kids, holiday and Drew Berrymore! it is almost impossible for a movie to be disappointing with these two. The jokes were funny, the kids were acting really good, musics were great. I saw the movie with my family and we all enjoyed (as Sandler fans) movie. His a few last attempts were really bad movies but this time he got it right again. And that's why I feel sad about all the bad reviews this movie has. Because some people are hating it just because they didn't like Adam Sandler's last movies, and they are ready to be automatic haters. Well if you like Adam Sandler (at least his 50 first dates, click era) you'll love this movie. I also loved the parts they used from earlier movies",2014
7,"I think Adam Sandler is a smart, talented entertainer and I also enjoy Drew Barrymore and the two together is a special treat.

5,"A bland movie! My wife and I drove out of town to one of the last drive- ins in our area. The Drive-In gets the B movies. Sandler makes many B movies. Sandler's funny days of Happy Gilmore are far behind him. The last good movie Sandler made was Anger Management. Blended is an example of Sandler's stalled career. The material is dated, and stale. Whatonce was shocking or over the top for Sandler is now redundant material! Embarrassed, overly stupid, and weird situations is all of Sandler's comic delivery. Blended is a cutesy love story with a few laughs. Watchable movie, but noting special. Blended would be the second feature in the Drive Inn after the main feature is shown. If the out of town drive-in had a double feature. Five stars out of ten.",2014

4,"I guess you could say Adam Sandler's Blended has a heart as opposed to Will Farrell's Anchorman 2 which doesn't? That postulated, for this viewer anyway, Anchorman 2 kept me in constant laughter while Blended hardly manages an occasional snicker. It's good to see Drew Barrymore and Sandler back together as they've had, I think, two previous pairings that, perhaps, had a modicum of chemistry. Here that pairing seems strained, perhaps because of Sandler's character needing to be actually funny since that is what Blended is obviously trying for. The laughs are truly spaced out which is to say way too many fall flat.",2014
9,"The trailer wasn't all too bad, but after watching the movie, I realized it didn't just give the right message about Blended and gave you all the best reasons to go see the movie.

3,"Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler has done it again. Made another movie that is. But I'm sad to say that, except for ""Jack and Jill"", it's one of the worst movie's Adam Sandler has ever made. The movie just gives you the feeling that they are trying to hard. Sadly both Drew and Adam, in this movie, are'nt even funny. It's mostly the kids and Terry Crews that supply the comedy, and it's not a lot of it. Terry is funny the first time's you see him in the movie, but frankly, he get's old pretty quick. ",2014

1,"Just writing a review to reinforce a clear mental note to NEVER see another Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore movie ever. The main problem with this one was the actors, the plot, and the writing. It was so bad it turned my stomach, especially all the singing by the Africans to outline the storyline...a technique clearly pinched from 'Something About Mary', but it was done soooo so poxy. I hated this movie, so did my wife, and my dog. To say it was a cookie cutter movie and predictable as hell is an understatement. Boy meets girl, kids don't like new dad, old dad is an ignorant dick who sleeps around, bad first date, they meet accidentally in shop, accidentally end up on an African vacation (like a Brady Bunch Hawaii 'special') Africans sing all the time and it's like Disneyland, oldest daughter is tom boy, gets make over by new mom, so then gets the guy she likes, new dad teaches kid to hit baseballs, he hits a home run at end of film (they love their baseballs metaphors in American films)Drew has a ridiculous job as a wardrobe arranger with a ridiculous friend who really unlikable because she hates kids (in quite a nasty way actually)I can't even be bothered to finish this review...I don't recommend seeing this, watch '50 First Dates' again instead.",2014
1,"I didn't have high expectations for this film since i knew Adam Sandler was one the WORST actors ever, but this movie still managed to shock me by how bad it is. First of all the bland, generic, interchangeable characters that contribute nothing to the ""plot"". No of the characters that get thrown at us have ANY redeeming qualities and get 0 character development. The movie just expects us to like the moronic characters even if there is nothing good about them. This movie uses a child hitting his head into a wall as ""comedy"" why is child abuse funny? Did one of the writers just suddenly think that a child in pain is funny? No one in the crowded theatre laughed once. This movie is abysmal and is just a lazy half assed performance by all of the actors. Especially Adam Sandler who is the most lazy and most overpaid actor. I seriously wish Adam would just retire from making crap movies like this one.",2014
3,"This movie could have been cute and sweet, but there were so many unnecessary attempts to attract the teen crowd -- at least I'm guessing that's the age group targeted. Children using foul language is not ""cute"" or humorous. Seeing animals copulating added no value to the story line, nor did the focus on the masturbating 15-year old. And what kind of mother buys her son a porn magazine because she ""violated"" her son's ""privacy"" by looking under his bed and tearing up a pin-up poster? ",2014
1,"Here's the story, of the lazy actor, who keeps turning out crappy movies all the time. This ones awful, like the others, he'll do anything for a dime. Here's the story of the well known actress. She made a career out of having a famous name. But she's working with Adam Sandler, so you know its lame. A pile of crap, a pile of crap, that's hoooow they produce a pile of crap. Here's the story he has three daughters. She has two sons. (What a novel twist, its what makes the story telling fabulous!) They have a terrible first date because the Adam Sandler character is a jerk. (What a stretch for Sandler going entirely with type.) Then they meet up again on a vacation to Africa. (Why Africa? Because Sandler wants to take his family on vacation and he wants you to pay for it. Plus he did every fart and poop joke a thousand times, and now he's innovating. He's doing wild animal fart and poop jokes, Quite the creative genius, that Sandler.) The problem here is like every Sandler movie: Its only funny enough to entertain a Lemur (Oh another reason to film in Africa.) And Sandler's ego. His every expression all the time is ""Ain't I adorable and don't you just love me?"" ""I am just so cute!"" The problem is the studios only release so many ""comedies"" per year. If Sandler makes one of his ego trips, that's one less comedy that gets made. Then Seth Rogan makes two stoner comedies and you can see that there's not much room for comedy for adults. Then the studios make a half dozen ""romantic comedies"" that aren't really comedies at all, just romance novels put on the screen. Its sad for people who like good comedy. I blame the critics and the awards. No one gives an award for comedy. Good comedy is not recognized and rewarded. As a result hacks like Sandler can film his paid vacation and put it on the screen.",2014
1,"It is hard to know where to begin with this gawd-awful film. Let's just say it had it all: bad acting, bad writing, predictable plot, unsympathetic characters - the works. Not one viewer in our group laughed a single time during this excruciatingly long, failed attempt at comedy. The South African bureau of tourism should probably sue Warner Brothers for lost revenue, based on how many people will never wish to visit the country after seeing the lame caricature of all things African portrayed in this movie. Seriously, it is that bad. Whatever chemistry Sandler and Barrymore had in ""The Wedding Singer"" is obviously irretrievably lost.",2015
1,"There is no possible way that this movie could have seriously been in Theaters or actually even consider calling itself a movie. This was a joke, not a single character played a convincing or necessary role in the movie, Drew Barrymore's performance looked like a little girl trying to keep herself from laughing, all of the children were incredibly annoying, I would much rather this have been a horror movie, where each person would eventually get picked off, at least then I would have something to look forward to (Harsh I know but this movie was that bad, if not worse). Adam Sandler is a washed up has-been who keeps ending up on the big screen for who knows what reason? The only actress that gave a decent performance in this ridiculously jumbled mess was the mother from the well acted Goldbergs television series. I could not finish this Youtube skit, because of how terribly it was acted, shot, scripted, scored, and executed. This had to have been written by children, no possible way this came from the minds of adults. The story seemed to have no direction except to put these two ineptly AWKWARD main leads in similar situations to have them spit on each other's past sorrows before making them realize how similar they truly are. This is poor directing in my opinion, and a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this painful movie to anyone. This was a joke and I hope one day people start realizing just how much money they spend on garbage like this, wake up, walk out on the movie, and have the balls to ask for their money back. Money is hard enough to make to be spending $14 for a ticket for something like this... you wouldn't throw money away to watch your garbage get incinerated, would you? So why would you waste money to watch this?????",2014

He's intelligent and sarcastic, and somehow manages to make topics that are completely horrific (e.g., the U.S. government's actions) not thoroughly depressing. I love how he will make fun of ANY political party; so many shows just spend their time panning Republicans, losing half the country as a result. Oliver must be a libertarian, because he very fairly simply makes fun of anyone who is doing something stupid, regardless of political affiliation. This is something that cannot be said of the unbearable John Stewart, or SNL, for example, but can be said of the awesome Lewis Black as well.",2014
10,"John Oliver is involved in one of the most tasteful shows I have come across which is currently in production. John pulls through with a very unique flavor which leaves the viewer thinking about the show long after it is over. His insightful outlook and commentary on a wide variety of issues is well worth the half hour (plus internet content). In my opinion, John doesn't, or at least attempts not to alienate any viewership the show may achieve but the show is perhaps designed to engage those with an open mind. The humorously named ""Last Week Tonight"" is a lot more than cheap laughs, and then some. In the few episodes that have aired so far, John has proved, at least to me personally, that him and his staff are capable of having very sophisticated opinions on some very deep issues. Honestly, I hope I can hear a lot more from John Oliver and the writers/staff involved!",2014

Laughing out loud so hard I can't stop and I have to get online and tell my friends to add this to their watch list is more rare than a lamb chop in Hell's Kitchen. John Oliver made The Daily Show funnier. It's great to see talent like that finally get its due share of hate mail.",2014
10,"Well first of all, I have always liked John Oliver. He is yet another talented comedian in a line of many others bred at the talent breeding grounds known as the Daily Show. For people who don't know, Oliver lured away the talented Tim Carvell, former head writer for the daily show, away from Jon Stewart. This was clearly a brilliant move and Stewart was nice enough to part with Carvell. Now that both Oliver and Carvell have a show on HBO with pretty much unlimited creative freedom, they are tackling the most important issues with a fearless tenacity that most comedians/hosts/shows can't afford to have. The reporting is concise and brilliantly edited, the delivery is sharp and witty, and the fact that the show is only 30 minutes long is long enough to hold most people's attention. Good job HBO on creating this gem!",2014

It takes a stance where overwhelming evidence lies and doesn't pussy out like other news.

Stoners reminiscing about Half Baked can keep TDS as their main source of news but at least now those of us willing to hear a different perspective on US issues and considerably more (and better) commentary on international affairs can at least have a weekly bit of entertainment. Only advice: Jon Oliver's audience is de facto more educated than TDS and we do not always need to laugh out loud to appreciate a segment, John Oliver does not need to mimic Jon Stewart's fear of silence and desperately reach out for trite laughs and non sequitur dick jokes whenever something isn't met with gut bursting laughter; America has youtube and getting high while watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force for that; sometimes being informative isn't (and does not need to be) outrageously funny.",2014

If he wants to expand his audience beyond liberal children, he should take a more balanced view otherwise he is just a small niche player. i am sure he has a loyal following because he panders to a certain demographic, but if a viewer is looking for someone who is truly funny that possesses an open mind then John Oliver is not a good fit. He is very similar to John Stewart in that regard as they are both extremely politically biased and, as a result, cater to a young audience. I am sure Oliver (just like Stewart) would derby his bias but it is clear to anyone with an analytical mind.

News is CNN, MSNBC, Washington post, wall street journal. They actually go out and do their own investigating. John Oliver watches news and takes what he heard, twists it into left wing garbage and talks about it for an hour. This show is the reason why millenials think Trump says things like all Mexicans are rapists. John Oliver watches the news, sees trump say there was a stat that said a lot of the illegal immigrants from Mexico are rapists, and puts in his show that trump says all Mexicans are rapists. Or he calls a woman ugly, which he has done to several men, and Oliver says Trumps a sexist bigot who hates women. Its just ridiculous. I hear people say they watch this because he is funny and gives his opinion. What, are you not smart enough to form your own opinions when given facts?

It's a shame, the show had potential. The few clips I've seen since have only reinforced my opinion. They are completely uncorked like the rest of the media over Trump becoming president.

Liberals always do this - they believe that all of their super biased political opinions aren't actually political opinions - but fact-based conclusions informed by science. As a result of this, they constantly stick science where it doesn't belong, and start claiming that science can answer questions like ""how should I live my life"" ""should I respect my elders?"" ""should I tell the truth""? etc. More and more, young people are starting to think that spiritual questions like this are the domain of science, and as a result of this, they come to believe that their personal take on such questions isn't a personal value judgment, but a scientific conclusions that only religious conservatives and science-deniers could possibly disagree with.

It has followed the same lines of Colbert which is to propagate dangerous globalist elitism at the expense of common sense or truth. These guys have shown themselves as sold out to the cocktail sipping elite and flushed the working class down the tube as they produce a divided world and spread race baiting lies to poison the minds of the young or vulnerable. Unfortunately he has become nothing more than a deep state establishment media sycophant.",2017
9,"First of all, I LOVE JOHN OLIVER. My heart has been so many times taken by different UK comedians that I have lost count. But yes, John Oliver, very nice! And that's why I picked up this show to watch and I can say that I wasn't disappointed, the opposite of that.",2014
1,"Parading as a likable ""funny"" news commentator, John Oliver is a force for the destruction of truth. His pattern is simple: first, he presents an idea which is in opposition to the ideas Time Warner wants his viewers to hold. Then, he makes a derisive quip mocking it— and anyone who holds it. Lastly his audience erupts into laughter, affirming to the viewer that it truly is stupid for anyone to hold that idea.",2016
4,"I was a big fan of John Oliver on The Daily Show and, at least for season one of Last Week Tonight, I remained a big fan. I expected that with the relaxed language filter on HBO the dialog might be a bit more, shall we say, salty, and in season one the f-bomb was dropped more or less appropriately. But it seems that in season two, and even more in season three, the ""colourful metaphors"" are being used more and more frequently. And it seems they are being used with the attitude that ""well, we have an unlimited supply of f-bombs so let's use as many as we can.""",2016
7,"This guy, John Oliver, is seriously brilliant! He is the best thing to happen to the American TV after Jon Stewart. I've never been a die-hard fan of TV series or talk-shows, rather only occasionally watching some of them here and there. But after I watched one or two episodes of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight last year, I was addicted to watch it every single week until now, and I sure will never stop following the show. It is unbelievably entertaining, funny, as well as being highly enlightening and sharp about the world's recent political, social, and economical issues and news. The only thing that I would want to be changed about this show is its running time which, as of today, is only 30 min every week (this is very annoying!). ",2015

4,Lets get couple things out of the way for the Hunger Games lovers. I am an avid movie go-er and enjoy great deal of fiction books. I have read all 3 books as well as watch the other 2 movies.,2015
7,"They're totally different in mood, feelings, and content. Hunger Games gets to see a female lead and one who doesn't have to use sex or promiscuity to be powerful! That alone makes this book/film franchise a winner in America. People, please remember that most stories are merely adaptations of other stories told before, just like with Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, A Christmas Carol, etc. There have simply been too many creators writing for too many years for anything to be truly fresh and original anymore. Almost every story you read or film you watch is lifted from a story told before (think about Disney-Almost none of their films are original, yet everyone loves them!). So while you're bashing all of the Rip-Off artists, like Suzanne Collins, just think about how many of your favorite books or films may have been stolen from someone else's idea, perhaps even hundreds of years ago.",2015
1,"I am a big fan of the first two movies specially the first one.How can you say: ""since I thought it was way better than the first two""? What is wrong with you? This movie Is long, boring and nothing happened in the last two hours. It is worst than Catching Fire is worst than The Hunger Games and The Worst of the series and all Hunger Games movies. Katniss does not do nothing! All she does is winning and crying about Peeta trough whole god damn movie. Peeta, Peeta, Peata...cry, cry...I lost them both....... cry"" In this movie their is not enough Haymitch, President Snow, Effie, Johanna only at the end of the movie and she is bold what happened?, Caesar and Finnick.None of the actors or actress is good enough or did a good job except Jennifer Lawrence. I did not pay to see Katniss being a whinny selfish cry baby trough whole movie.I pay to see a bad-ass and that's what in this movie wasn't and killed the previous movies and the third sequel. All she did was walking and talking and winning about Peeta for 2.hrs. What an embarrassment awful boring disappointment! The Hunger Games (2012) the first movie of the series in my opinion was the best of all the three films ever made from the novels. I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) was pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. The third movie The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 (2014) is the worst one of the three and awful terrible sequel of the first two movies and it is a sad true disappointment. I hope part 2 redeems it self and get's better than this movie is. I also own both the previous movies of on Blu-ray discs and this movie will not come near my Blu-ray collection! I wanted to see Katniss rescuing Peeta shooting with the bow and arrow,kill at least a few enemies that deserve it , getting closer to President Snow and Capital. Katniss been a bad-ass and tough, trough whole movie but sadly she was not. She was a cry baby and she did do anything except winning.I excepted so much more from Katniss than just this: more intense what will happened in the next scene but there was absolutely nothing. Nothing! It took a real bad turn. Katniss been hot and interesting but instead she was gross. Effie and Johanna gorgeous but no sadly they weren't. My final question for the people who like this movie is : Why do you like this movie so much? When is not what it is supposed to be for us true fans and what we expected and wanted to be. A true disappointment!",2015
5,"....or not. After 2 movies you would think the main character has evolved. Well, she didn't. Constant whining and uselessness push the spectator away to the point that you don't care about Katniss. You actually get tired of her.",2015
2,Let me state that I enjoyed the first two movies and actually thought that there was something of value in the story behind the silly teenage action flick..,2015
1,"I have to admit that probably never looked more boring blockbuster of this. Stretched to the pain, the enforced acting, empty dialogues, in two hours absolutely nothing worth mentioning, aside from the great James Howard's song sung by Jennifer Lawrence (The Hanging Tree). Unfortunately, I was expecting a lot more after the first two episodes, although we all should be clear when they changed the original decision to extend the trilogy in four parts. The horror of this desperately poor screenplay could not be mended nor sound actors. Hollywood seems to run out of steam... This garbage was never meant to be taken and company should pay back the money to people and even compensate them for mental anguish and lost time watching this disaster. Big thumb down! (and ready rotten tomatoes)",2015
3,"Firstly, i gotta point out that seeing ""Part 1"" in the title is already an upfront (and somewhat prejudgment) letdown. I rarely see and fond of the sequels except for Godfather, animated features AND The Hunger Games as the books are so good. Although, i didn't expect they could bring the whole book into the screen, i expected it to be AT LEAST able to keep it up with the first two. But no, every single scene is stretched out to meet the requirement of minimum length for a feature film. The film is darker than prequels so imagining it's just getting longer and longer without a purpose, its very frustrating.",2015
1,"The movie has barely any substance to it at all because new line cinemas had the genius idea to make the slowest, shortest and worst book into 2 parts. The plot consists of Katniss finding a bunch of nothing and talking to people once. She barely does anything at all that genuinely has anything to do with the plot. The movie is abysmal at best and should be avoided so movie companies stop ruining finales by splitting them into 2 parts. The same thing happened with Harry Potter. Part 1 was slow, dull and overall, a horrible experience. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 follows the same pattern. Maybe the second part will be OK, but based on the first two movies, I wouldn't get your hopes up.",2015
1,"I enjoyed the first two parts and was completely surprise by this one. The script is bad, the rhythm of the story is very slow and I didn't understand some of the things that happen there. Why is she not in love with her boyfriend anymore and suddenly she loves Peeta? It doesn't make sense. Also, her performance is really bad and the other actors are not doing better either. Almost nothing is credible anymore. And since the script does not have a clear continuance, I almost forgot what happened in the first two parts. Really bad, I watched it hoping till the end that at some point it will get back to its 'original' rhythm and to a better performance of the actors.",2015
1,"This is the second time I am reviewing any title (the first one was Skyline). the first movie kind of showed a bit promise leading me to watch the #2 and ultimately #3. Regretting it so much. Not gonna waste anymore time writing any longer- just know that it was bad, almost as bad a twilight. So now I am copying and pasting this bit to make the lower limit of words of a review- so don't read any longer- trying to help, not annoy.",2015
1,"I have read this series and the 3rd book was a let down, seemed the author was rushed to write it in a week - so disappointing ant Mockingjay 1 is the same. Any part that could have been exciting they didn't show. So many errors that I could not even believe would happen in real life - wont spoil it but anyone intelligent can see the HUGE mistake done by the army. This would never happen in true life! Okay I gotta say - they rescue Peeta, were able to fly out of city with no problems!! Then they leave Katniss alone with him??? Really?? No red flags??? DUH!! Summary - main character cries for more then 75% of boring movie!",2015
1,"It is one of the most boring movie...no meaning...senseless and i don't understand some people who judge this movie because of the acting of main actor?!?!?! Who is responsible for wasting two hours of my life with such a loser subject? Maybe the game is famous and beautiful to play and this loser director should create something more nicer than just a game and i realized that this director is good to spend money for fake empty boring senseless ideas. I didn't understand anything what happened. I don't know what is the idea of this movie, what is the subject or what is the moral. I cannot tell even to my friends what happened in these two hours with this Katniss or Peeta or other amateur soldiers with their pretending moves. I would punish this director not to have chance to make a movie again in his life.",2015
1,1. The pace is very slow. Literally nothing happen in the first 1.5 hour. ,2015
3,"Let me first note that I am an avid movie-goer, but not a reader of the books. I did, however, watch the first two Hunger Games movies and was pleasantly surprised by them. They kept my attention, with plot and performances intriguing and action-packed enough to get from one scene to the next without a dull moment.",2014
1,"War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.",2015
3,Boring to point I got up and went to back of theater to check IMDb on my Tablet to see what was I missing. Obviously I was lacking somehow and must be missing something I figured with all the rage around this movie. ,2014
2,"Unfortunately it seems that without the Games there is just no longer any point to this franchise and it just sinks into tedious bloodletting mediocrity. Katniss now comes over as mentally unstable and President Snow is simply an over-the-top homicidal lunatic. There is no way that even the pampered poseurs of Capitol (or whatever it is called I have now lost interest in the names) would put up with their leader's carrying out such murderous activities in their name. Yet, even with all of the bloodletting going on, none of it visualised of course, this movie is a bore from start to finish. It is an illogical bore too. Snow has gone from being a cold but efficiently ruthless ruler to a parody of a dictator deliberately setting up his own downfall. Instead of taking the opportunity to destroy the mockingjay, he decides to play into her hands by wasting a hospital (no spoiler needed as this is clearly shown in the trailer). Don't waste your money going to see this movie as there is nothing to learn about the events that will end in the second Mockingjay. You will be able to go and see MJ2 and pick up the storyline immediately. The feeling of 'something is missing' are all in this movie. How did all of this suddenly come about? Sophisticated underground bunkers, rebel presidents, captured technology, etc., ad nauseum. You know what is truly annoying? It has all been done before and done much better. Can you say Matrix?",2015
3,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it folks, this one is not worth seeing on the big screen. I came in expecting a good experience that I had received from its predecessors, but was left with an utter mess of a film and a disappointment to the name. From watching the previous movies, I know these films aren't exactly 10/10 material, but they are quite entertaining and have some emotional high points. The ones here were few and far between, and Katniss's many emotional breakdowns were not any of them. You know it's bad when the main character becomes a drag and isn't nearly as inspiring (nothing against J-Law). While Haymitch and Effie were awesome once again, they could not salvage everything else. Torrid acting and drawn out sequences that were re-played over and over helped make the story so predictable that even those who don't know the books could figure it out ",2015
3,"It seems that nowadays it's a trend to make two movies for one book and fill it with scenes that we don't need to watch. I haven't read the books, although i've heard good things about them, but since nothing happened in the movie I automatically assume that it didn't cover many things from the book. We see endless ""boohoo"" scenes that are not even touching that lead to nothing and when we think that ""finally, at least we will watch the first battle of this war in this movie"" again nothing happens. The only good aspect of this movie is the interesting game with politics between president Snow who tries to scare everyone and prevent them from joining the rebels using Peeta and president Coin who tries to rouse everyone to fight using the Mockingjay, Katniss; all of this propaganda using the media. But again, it takes too long for nothing. At least the previous ones had some action.",2014
1,"Katniss criticized her sister went back to save her cat and said the cat was stupid cat, her sister can do whatever she wants. I really hate her with no mercy with animals, and acted like she was kindhearted in the movie, such a hypocrite. Jenifer Lawrence's acting was awful, for example, at the beginning when she step on the skull, that is not how a person will act in real life, face expression is more complex than just cover your mouth and shred a tear, for people who are more emotional unstable they would even hold their fists so tight and tremble, but her character does not fit in this category and she has experience of seeing dead, so all she needed to act is complex face expression.",2015
9,"I've been craving something of quality along these lines set in this period ever since that magnificent HBO John Adams miniseries of five or six years ago. I feel like failing on my knees and thanking the TV gods that AMC made the shift into television, because BOY do they do it right. ",2014
9,I love TV but I am so completely bored with the offerings of my hundreds of channels. Virtually no thematic variety.,2014
10,"After watching the 1.5 hour pilot for the new AMC show ""Turn"", I can say that I was very pleased with the introduction to this drama and I have high hopes that its level of quality will continue.",2014
9,"The producers of this movie showed inner fortitude in bringing this series to life knowing the dismal history of RevWar movies in either general excellence, box office success or both. ",2014
9,"I found this series to be outstanding.. It's well written & well acted but for some reason it hasn't ""caught on"" is it because people are more interested in UNreality T.V. or would they rather watch something that doesn't take up to much space in their brain or (in my opinion) did AMC not do enough to promote this gem of T.V. shows? Well, in the end the reason doesn't really matter because as of right now season 2 isn't gonna happen & that's a crying shame.. The characters in this show are so likable even the villain Capt. Simcoe is one you love to hate but he would be missed if he were to be killed off.. In closing My-Two-Cent are merely My-Two-Cent & with those two cent you'r not gonna be able to pay the bills so AMC will most likely cancel a great show & we will be left wondering if Simcoe ever gets whats coming to him or if Abe Woodhall ends up with his first love Anna Strong & these are questions I want answers to so I hope & pray that AMC makes the right decision & renews this wonderful show..!",2014
8,"Excellent first episode!!!! Great acting, direction, cinematography, production and plot!!! I'm a fan of shows set in that period of our history, but it can get very dark and tiresome sometimes. ""Turn"" has that quality that will make you wanting more, at least this is what I am taking from the first one hour and a half of the season premiere. I have a feeling that will drive and attract people to visit ""Williamsburg"" in Virginia, to be part of the story of that time. I have to say that I am very impressed by Jamie Bell's performance as ""Abe Woodhull"" as well Heather Lind as ""Anna Strong"". I think they will be a big hit, as I have a feeling that they might get ""closer"" again. Also Jamie Bell was ""Billy Eliott"" in the movie. How cool is that? Can't wait for next week's episode!!!!",2014
10,"It's AMC folks. They tend to start slow. But good Lord episodes 8, 9 & 10 picked up the pace in BRILLIANT fashion. The characters have developed perfectly, the impossible relationships they all kept during such confusion is wonderful & historically accurate (history major here). I love Woodhall & Anna Strong's relationship. Their chemistry is spot on. Sure, the formation of the ACTUAL spy ring has taken longer than I'd have liked. But they're clearly getting there, and answering the questions I've had in time. Well done, AMC. This could have swung badly, and instead picked up to be one of my new favorites, on par in terms of weekly anticipation, with Thrones. Cheers. God Bless America & God Save The Queen :)",2014
8,"I wasn't expecting too much from this despite the excellent trailers because, generally speaking, the Brits don't come across too good in ANY respect when it comes to the American portrayal of the War of Independence (Patriot for example)or in any other TV show for that matter.",2014
10,It usually takes me couple of episodes to decide if the story will be good or not. I've watched the pilot and the 2nd episode and all I can say is that it's going to be a huge show. It leaves you wanting to watch the next episode. i don't want to ruin the episodes but honestly it will hold you in constant suspense throughout. The filming and acting is great along with the well written script. After reading some reviews that its not historically correct you can argue that most films or shows on true stories are not exactly depicted as what really happened. Nevertherless its entertaining and something different to watch. Brilliant ! Well done AMC for releasing another great show after walking dead.,2014
10,"AMC does it again! Hooked from the 1st episode. Can't wait for April 13, 2015!",2015
10,"I watch TV for what I think is good entertainment, and I feel, Turn,' is falling into that category. I am not looking for an accurate retelling of history I have been around long enough to know that Holly-weird avoids most honest assessments of history like the plague. If a square peg doesn't fit their idea of a round hole, they shave the edges until it fits. I also understand that there are people who wish to elevate Governor John Simcoe to sainthood - great, he probably was a super guy. One must remember that war tends to bring the worst out of people. Simcoe, proved his tactical brilliance numerous times. In one instance, as a major, he led a surprise attack at the, 'Battle of Crooked Billet,' resulting in a brilliant victory. I don't know how accurate witness' accounts of the horrific treatment of prisoners of war actually were by the Loyalists, and I have questions concerning the accuracy of stories about Loyalists burning living captives to death. Incidetns worthy of questions...but should not be poo-poo and completely dismissed. Atrocitites happened. With that being said, Samuel Roukin portrays Simcoe as one down-right dirty rotten scoundrel of a bad guy (every good show needs a good antagonist) and boy, does he do an outstanding 'bad guy,' impersonation. I also think Jamie Bell and Heather Lind are superb. When those two sneaky little connivers get together you just know all hell is getting ready to be unleashed. Once those two wacky Colonial Devils get a-foot you just don't know what the heck is around the bend. Intrigue...I love it. I am still getting to know the rest of the gang – I mean – cast, but I like them. They all seem to be very good at their jobs. Again, I am not looking to have history explained to me, I have books for that (I don't really believe too much of anything I read either - corroboration is required there as well). I hope this show is successful, but I don't see this lasting more than a year or two. There is just so much one can fit into such a small location and over such a small and touchy time-frame. For those who have read anything about the Revolutionary War, you may or may not agree (and who really cares anyways – I dreamed this theory up myself, so you come up with your own)the outcome depended so heavily on things falling into just the right place at just the right time. The end-result of the War could have (and maybe should have? hmmmm) gone the other way. I do hope the show succeeds and doesn't try to warp history too much. Once the plot wanders too far out onto some outstretched limb, and it has no chance of finding its way back – I fire the show from my TV. Until then...I will continue to watch - excellent job.",2014
6,"Yes, the acting could be better, but how TURN takes a different viewpoint on American history is extremely charming. It's about American spies and based on one of the many books about Washington's Six, but other than little historical inaccuracies it's a great show. Still, in order to enjoy this show you have to know a good amount about Revolutionary War history before you can absorb the full effect, yes the soap opera aspect is there and not exactly important, but some people need some love story to keep watching. Overall, TURN is well made and it's a great show for history buffs or just people who enjoy learning about untold history.",2014
10,"I absolutely love TURN! This is simply a PHENOMENAL SHOW with a great cast. It's every bit as much intrigue as Sherlock and Holmes & King Henry the 8th meeting up with all the modern day politics of Scandal and the patriotism of West Wing....It's even better as it's based on our OWN history! Amazing story of events that happened in our own backyards! Every time I watch I want to learn more. Go online and you will be impressed to learn how much of this history actually happened. The writers have done a great job. They really bring history alive with all the virtue and vices of these people from angst, passion and arrogance to the sacrifice, drive and courage of these people. Lieutenant Simcoe is a despicable savage but I can't wait to see what he will do next and how the spy network & local people work to take him & others down! Watch it and pass it on! It will make you proud to be an American! I want to see more! SPREAD THE WORD TO HELP IT GROW.",2015
9,"When i first heard about the show i wasn't all that psyched but i still decided to check it out because i really find the American revolution interesting. Let me tell you when i saw the first couple of episodes i had a little trouble following the dialogue and at one point almost decided to drop it, i am so glad i didn't. i am mainly basing this review on the last episode,even though the entire series as a whole was excellent. The series finale not only kept me glued to my seat but on the edge of it. The entire series was good but the finale was a bloodbath, they went a little overboard with killing a whole bunch of people but that only tightened the grip on the show even more. my favorite character in the entire show has to be Captain simcoe,the main antagonist. Samuel Roukin not only played his role, he dominated it. I loved the part where he finally cracked. In his mind, you could literally see the essential part that allows us as humans to be reasonable and not act too rash shatter. When Simcoe saw that Maj. Hewlett was going to issue a peaceful trade-off in where the rebels would return the British soldiers without them being harmed and the royal army would return the captured prisoners, he lost it and did the deal breaker, the final squeeze of a show that was already gripping me pretty tight, the final shove that pushed me to the very last edge of my seat, what i consider the climax of the entire episode and the entire series. He grabs Brewster's grandfather takes him outside,for all the rebels to see, pulls out a pistol, puts it to the poor old man's neck and without any hesitation whatsoever pulls the trigger. Now this action as aggressive and enough for me as it was, was not the end of it,oh no, i was satisfied with simcoe killing the old man and that being it but no, another reason this is such an amazing show is when you've had enough and you say ""oh, no thank you, my nerves have had enough and i have enough goosebumps as it is"" this show says no! you haven't had enough and to the shock of all the rebels and me simcoe lets the old man's lifeless body fall to the ground and with blood splattered on his face gives off one final scream of insanity and then cuts to commercials.Normally when a show cuts to commercials everybody's just like ""aw man"" and this time is no exception, i still hate when a show cuts to commercials but this was timed perfectly. It is kinda like hearing a really good conspiracy theory and then thinking about it later when it has had time to sink in. Throughout the entire commercial period i was petrified at how amazing the role of a madman can be played if the right man plays him, i was reminded of that feeling i haven't felt since i saw heath ledger's performance of the joker in the dark knight. Even as i am playing the scene over in my head right now i am getting goosebumps. And after that, shocking and trilling things happened throughout the remainder of the episode, like Abe learning it is kill or be killed when the British redcoat living in your house finds out you are a rebel spy and his and Mary's plan to escape punishment for this horrible incident but none can compare to the real performance we got from captain simcoe,the last time i saw such a primal,insane and just plain psychotic look in a man's eyes like that i was watching a video documentary on the third Reich. An amazing show,hope they bring back and end season two with a bang as big as they ended the first season with and i expect to see more of captain simcoe.",2014
7,"I saw the commercial for this show during the season finale of 'The Walking Dead' and it had me hooked. The show had a lot to set up in the beginning and some might have said it started slow, but it couldn't have finished stronger. The last scene of the episode reminded me of the last scene of 'The Godfather' in the way that the main characters made a pledge for loyalty, but were really organizing a secretive attack. I'm amazed at how many future plot points were developed in one episode (the father, the wife, the ex-fiancée, the murder mystery, the internal American spy, etc). This show looks like it has so much to offer and I will tune in for the rest of the season.",2014
10,"This episode was absolutely amazing! I loved every minute of it! I have been waiting for weeks for 'Turn' to air. The actors were perfect! Turn is incredibly inspiring, exciting, and it completely reals you into that period of time. Not only does it tell the story of our great nations beginning, it gives the viewers a sense of the good old American spirit! Which almost everyone could use a little these days. I'm glad AMC picked this story...personally one of my favorite stories. Hoping for many seasons to come!! Can't wait for the next show! I'm wondering what's going to happen with the whole fire thing? Make sure to spread the word about AMC's hit new TV show!! Shout out to Jamie Bell (Abe Woodhull) your hot!;)",2014
3,"I probably don't know as much about the Revolution as I should so I am not aware of all the inaccuracies so they don't bother me that much. After all, we know it is fiction so why try to berate it for not being truthful.",2015
5,"I would normally rate this at an 8, but it's sad that once again liberal Hollywood has twisted the facts about our founders and in particular one of our greatest founders.

For those critics who nit pick at issues of historical accuracy, get a life! Who cares whether this is historical fact or not? It is stunning work and great entertainment in every detail. I do hope the producers and AMC are not discouraged by the hounds who are trying to rip it apart - who knows what their motives are...",2015

8,(Flash Review),2017
9,An intriguing show that while having the potential to be confusing at first ends up being a very interesting spy thriller. As an Australian I was concerned it would be a blindly patriotic show but was pleasantly surprised to see a dialogue and story that while obviously coming from the American side doesn't paint all the British as evil and shows some of the complexity involved in the war of independence. ,2015
8,"From it's initial premiere, I knew this new mid-season ""mini-series"" had potential. About time cable TV brought us something History-based. Though some aspects may not be historically-accurate such as a few language gaps, per say, it IS a good show overall. And history buffs will indeed engage its overall embodiment.",2014
9,"first this may or may not contain spoilers depending on how it's read. I enjoy this show, although historically inaccurate. Characters have been changed a lot, the way the characters interact have been changed and even added. The show is based on a book written by Alexander Rose but is not how it really happened. Having done a research paper on the Ring and read Tallmadge's memoir I disagree with how the show has been written, yet it makes for an interesting show.",2014
8,"I am appalled at the ignorance of some of the things posted in the boards of this show. I think it's pretty outstanding! The casting is excellent, the attention to history in detail of costumes and culture is awesome and I rather like the fact that Marco Polo himself is more of an observer than a main character...the Mongols, especially Kublai Khan, stealing every single scene! People have bemoaned the ""stiffness"" of the actors; I can only chalk that up to very little exposure to Asian culture, film or acting! Watch some classic Asian made films and you'll see the acting in this offering is very true to form. As for casting of Chinese as Mongols when they are two very distinctly different ethnic groups,the make-up did a very credible job transforming them into believable Mongols...who are much darker in skin than Chinese, have higher cheekbones, broader faces and a more pronounced slant to the eyes than Chinese as well. The choice to have each group speak in English was a wise business decision. The biggest audience for this is Americans who don't exactly have much patience with subtitles. There was a nice combination of native languages spoken either in the background or as asides that gave one a good flavor of the languages. The attention to detail in costuming was really, really good. And for those worried about historical accuracy...there are almost 150 different editions or versions of The Travels of Marco Polo which is the travelogue ""written"" (actually spoken to a scribe) by Polo himself. They all have great flights of fantasy and magic and extremely improbable events in them so much so that some scholars have wondered if Polo had ever really been to all the places he claimed to visit, so a few inaccuracies ( like everyone speaking in English) is actually right in line with Polo's original work and actually might have been something the author himself might have appreciated. In short, stop looking for production and script flaws, stop displaying such ignorance about Asian cultures and just sit back and enjoy a darn good-adventure film!",2014

9,"I have just finished watching episode 9. So many reviews and people have been hating on this series. Honestly, it is seldom that i watch something for nearly 9 hours straight....and this was one of them.",2014
9,I was anticipating watching this series as it was being advertised before its release. I was disappointed that the initial reviews called it boring and slow moving while lauding the cinematography. I'm glad I decided to see for myself.,2014
8,"Although littered with historical and biographical inaccuracies and exaggerations, Marco Polo has a good quality production and creates an escapist atmosphere of a mythologized past. The acting is average, and the story lines and characters are intriguing. The settings and camera work are great, and rather than solely focusing on Marco Polo the show has many other characters' roles and perspectives. The sense of power struggles is well laid out, although not even close to Game of Thrones level in scope (obviously).",2014
8,"Do yourself a favor and don't compare this to Games of Throne. You may actually like it. I really didn't like the first episode but after some time the characters, the plot and performances hit their stride. I also think it's great that Hollywood put something like this out there. How can anyone not be interested, it is so different and unique in every way. I feel like they are just starting to scratch the surface with this series. And there are some much to say about Kublai Khan, his reign and what happened.",2014
10,"This is an excellent production, everything about this series is great, from story line to direction, acting, locations and production. I loved historical movies and one of my all time favorite was ""Braveheart"" and watching this series made my day. Cant wait for season 2. I challenged to those who say that it is bad, because they simply don't know. All the characters fits their role, Specially Benedict Wong as Kublai Khan and Tom Wu as hundred eyes and Marco Polo. Polo, played by Italian actor Lorenzo Richelmy, is abandoned by his father in a foreign land where he makes an enemy of a sneering prince while also catching the eye of a fair maiden. And how does does he become the target of both jealously and love? By simply existing as a handsome outsider who doesn't directly want to bother anyone. So trouble in various forms find Polo without him actively looking for conflict.",2014
10,"Cast roles are great. The way Mongolian empire shown in contrast with Chinese is remarkable. Song dynasty and Yuan dynasty clashes with exquisite sets and costumes. Horse riding scenes were breath taking. I recommend this and its must watch especially for those who are into history. Although i found this to be bit short of only 10 episodes, i wished they could have extended more to show the aftermath. I am eager for the next season and i hope they will release it soon. Loved the role of kublai khan and Song chancellor too. Earlier i was skeptical regarding show whether to watch it or not after reading several critics but believe me u should watch it for sure.",2014
10,"Still there're some little problems look funny to me, like people live Song Dynasty used to call their country the Song Empire, some administration staff were actually wearing clothes from the hundreds of years later's Ming Dynasty. And Chinese people, even including Mongolians, never call others' names directly because they have a alternative name like the middle name of Americans, only in extremely official occasions would they do that. ",2014
9,"Firstly, I am very interested in show since I saw first trailer. It was an impressive trailer. Especially Mongolia Empire is always interested for me. First episode's processing and storytelling were very well. Also characters and environment is magical.",2014
9,"Excellent show!!! It has a very good story line combined with fascinating characters each depicting their own interesting story line. I first thought that the show's creators would fail to introduce a western character in an eastern set up but unexpectedly they did quiet well. Furthermore for the Mongolia meets China, with a western explorer being thrown right in the middle and making it work,Kudos to the creators. The show shows that a fairly large amount of money has been spent on it, the costumes, weapons, fight/war sequences are all outdone. Recommended for fans of Tudors, Game of Thrones, etc. With original shows like this Netflix is certainly taking to the big leagues.",2014
10,"Spoiler Alert: This story enveloped me. I'm a fan of shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones. I love Doctor Who. But Marco Polo has bewitched me on a whole new level. The actor who portrays Kublai Khan is amazing. I feel the Genghis power just watching him. Watching the entire cast perform their multi- faceted roles is mesmerizing. I can see how they have depicted so many cultures in such developed ways. From the way 100 eyes says ""rootless"" to Marco's initial martial arts skills, to the way Yusuf and Ahmad talk about their rough childhoods. The female cast are amazing. The strength, brutality and sadness of their lives is shown in a respectful, profound way. I cannot wait for Season 2. Season 1 was worth every minute.",2014
7,"Marco Polo, season one, is beautiful. It's visually stunning. It has a very interesting (although perhaps not compelling) story and some excellent acting (especially by Benedict Wong). But it's lacking. Season one is good - but just good. It's not great.",2016
9,"As an Italian born and raised in Venice (you'll forgive my English), I feel compelled to say something about this show. I won't discuss acting or cinematography, since they've already undergone all sorts of criticism. I'd like to state one simple fact: the cultural value of the show in itself is reason enough for its existence.",2014
6,"Netflix offers us a beautifully produced and visually pleasing historical drama. Although historically inaccurate in some parts, thus making Marco Polo a medieval fantasy of sorts, the drama, war, assassinations and political intrigue and characters are interesting enough to make this worth your time.",2014
10,"This show is amazing. Well directed, great acting, beautiful sceneries, and thrilling storyline. I've read negative reviews from people who have watched only one episode but this series needs to be watched till the very end. The story may be not historically accurate, but it is a beautiful portrait of the dynamics of Kublai Khan dynasty and how Marco Polo was involved with Mongols. The scenery and the sets were absolutely magnificent. The costumes were appropriately chosen and the cast did an awesome job portraying their characters, especially Benedict Wong. Certainly a must watch and I hope season 2 be released sooner.",2014
10,"It is clearly a top-notch, no expense-spared production alongside a great story which is told from an entirely fascinating time/place in history that has, amazingly, been relatively ignored considering the quality AND quantity of material available.",2014
1,"Apparently Netflix is trying HBO recipe for making historical series: Deliver one dimensional characters, boring story, don't care one bit about historical accuracy, make nonsensical changes to the historical events that just worsens the story, have boring acting and try to compensate for your incompetence with beautiful scenery and porn, porn porn. Tired of watching naked white-women, well then Netflix will give you tons of naked Asian-women. Since there are Chinese in the movie lets add some wuxia kung fu, ying and yang and other Asian clinches to the hole mix, and since the writer where jerking of while writing, lets have a naked woman do insane kung fu.",2014
1,Marco Polo is definitely a remarkable story. Those who have knowledge about Yuan Dynasty and Hunnic people will understand there are many flaws with the this production. First of all Yuan dynasty wasn't a Chinese empire therefore using excessive Chinese perception makes the story no different than imaginary fiction without any historical connection other than using the names. Obviously production in terms of financing is very bold. Almost all actors are Chinese those who have no similarity to appearance nor characteristics of Yuan dynasty's governing elites. ,2015
3,"Yes the film shots and colors are amazing however the script is seriously disabled. I think that season one was bad but season two was even worse, some of the actors outfits (and lines) looked like they came straight out of the film-set Xena the Warrior princess. Moreover the stereotypes of the ''orient'' became so annoying that I barely could continue watching the second season ( People that do not understand should read the academic work by Edward W. Said, Orientalism. 1978). I can only recommend this Netflix series to people who would enjoy a fusion of The karate kid, Xena the warrior princess and Spartacus. Moreover I do not have an issue with nudity however I think that it should remain functional, this means that it should contribute to the historic/present context of the story, It beats me why there is a nude fighting scene. Marco Polo could have become the successor of Shogun (1980) but instead it became offensive, not for its nudity but for its ''orientalism''.",2016
8,"Production: Outstanding. The locations, sets, costumes and general aesthetic are of a rudely high quality for television. This show was made with love and with enough resources to make it really stand up among its competitors. Looks and feels better than GoT. CGI when used is perfectly passable, but there was a clear emphasis on doing it for real wherever possible in this show, something that speaks greatly to its credit. ",2014
8,"Marco Polo is definitely a show that is worth watching. In the beginning i thought they wanted to make a more realistic version of GoT, and some elements of this show are very reminiscent of GoT. That being said it is standing on it's own two feet, from what i have seen so far the acting is good. CGI is noticeable on occasion but nothing that takes you ""out"" of the show. The pace has been good so far with enough action to keep you interested and just the right amount of characters. Right from the start there are some cool and very interesting characters among them, my favorite being ""hundred eyes"". The location shots are beautiful and well filmed. I have no mayor complaints about this show so far but i will have to watch the rest of the season to see if it holds up. I saw some discussion concerning subjects like ""polo has never been to China"" etc. To be honest i do not know if he has ever been there but i couldn't be less bothered. They have taken an iconic character and put him in a ,so far, very decent show. I enjoy it very much so far and would recommend anyone to give it a shot.",2014
5,"Nice production values, but main characters are lifeless, emotionless automatons. Furthermore, hearing the Asians speak 'American' is initially awkward, then becomes grating and ultimately too much to tolerate. By the end of the third episode I could not stand this fake construct any more and proceeded to watch the 1982 original, which is vastly superior in almost every aspect (except for the CGI, which did not exist then). Comparing this in quality to a gem like the Tudors is in my opinion absurd, bordering on the ridiculous. Another example of Hollywood kitsch , not Art ",2014
4,Netflix's Marco Polo is a collection of Chinese stereotype objects: ,2014
3,"Visually stunning and excellent costuming. Having said that, it's really not much more than soft porn wrapped within pseudo-history. Full of mumbling and anachronisms, it was painful for me to watch as a history teacher. Morally, it is not something I could show in a family setting. Typical rendering of our times - pushing an immoral agenda in the guise of history.I don't buy that the sex scenes have to be included. They are NOT included for historical accuracy - they are included to appeal to prurient instincts. If you read the writings of Polo, I think you will get a much different picture than this film portrays. So sad we've reached this point in media entertainment. It could have been a marvelous series.",2014
9,"I was fortunate enough to see this at the 52nd New York Film Festival; the centerpiece of this year's festival, Paul Thomas Anderon's Inherent Vice (adapted from the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name) will no doubt divide critics and audiences. It certainly divided me.",2014
10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's seventh film, Inherent Vice, is a surreal, kinky, and stoned epic of mammoth proportions. The fact that Anderson decided to be the first director adapt the wild prose of Thomas Pynchon is an achievement in of itself. Set in Los Angeles in the early Seventies, Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) awakens from his stony stupor when his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) tries to find sanctuary from her real-estate mogul boyfriend, his wife, and her boyfriend. In traditional noir fashion, not all is simple as it sounds as a bigger presence is involved with a cavalcade of characters thrown into Doc's world; a heroin-addicted sax player from a surf-rock band (Owen Wilson), a coked- up dentist with the libido of a rabbit (Martin Short), and an LAPD officer/failed actor (Josh Brolin) busting anyone with long-hair and forming a strange love/hate bond with Doc.",2014
4,"Break out a pen and paper cause so much is going on it's hard to follow watching this for the first time. So many characters, so many plots surrounding sub-plots surrounding plots, you could easily lose your place if your attention wavers in the slightest. I felt like I needed to make an outline to make sense of it all. The movie is very hard to follow and needs a second viewing to fully grasp the whole thing.",2015
3,"To watch actors dryly deliver page after page of plot that no one comprehends or is interested in while they imitate the acting style of old Hollywood noir films and stoner comedies is not why I go to the movies. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great filmmaker when he uses his own voice, and thankfully this film is the only exception to that.",2014
10,"Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, an unorthodox private-eye (Joaquin Phoenix) smokes a joint in his California shore-house--the waves on one side, and a whole mess of bad vibes on the other. Then in walks his ex-old lady, Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston), brining some of those bad vibes with her. She's with a married man now, Mickey Wolfmann, and his wife wants her help to make off with his money and get him sent to a loony-bin. Through a cloud of marijuana smoke, Doc barely manages to mumble, ""I think I've heard of that happening once or twice."" Agreed, Doc, that does seem pretty predictable. But then Wolfmann disappears and so does Shasta and the body count begins to climb. What follows is one of the most unique and unexpected trips of 2014. Inherent Vice throws the audience into the year 1970. Everyone wants to just smoke a joint and love each other, but they can't seem to stop the wave of paranoia that's overtaking them. As Doc delves deeper into the seemingly infinite mystery that unravels, neither he nor the audience is ever sure who to trust. One of these beautifully morally ambiguous characters is Lt. Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who gets plenty of screen-time and spends most of it eating frozen bananas and railing against hippies. Brolin and Phoenix's on-screen chemistry is off the charts, and the complicated relationship between their characters is explored through scenes of extreme hilarity. At the same time that I was questioning Bigfoot's moral compass and how dedicated he really is to justice, I was watching the screen through a filter of tears from laughter. ",2014
9,"'Straightforward' is not a word I will use in this review to describe Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film Inherent Vice. Lying somewhere at the crossroads between a '70s neo-noir film and an absurdist stoner comedy, this neon-tinged detective story is two-and-a-half hours of increasingly absurd psychedelic mayhem. It's dense, confusing, chaotic, and absolutely riveting in its amorphous plotting and paranoid atmosphere.",2014
1,"I saw this movie at the cinemas because it looked like an interesting detective mystery with old fashioned noir roots and intertwining plots and characters. These sort of films are among my favorite and it doesn't hurt that I am a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson to begin with. I personally look at him as being one of the more exemplary filmmakers of his time with classics such as Boogie Nights and Magnolia. His style is much like Scorsese's and his execution reminds me of Kubrick in many ways, cementing him in Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with. ",2015
7,"Let's start this off with a reward offering. I'll pay anyone $20 if they can explain to me, in detail, the full plot and synopsis of ""Inherent Vice,"" front to back. That's a good place to start, eh?",2014

10,"Yeah, probably : under the paving stones, the beach. But we'll never know. The 60's are over, the dream is gone and the pavement which imprisons it is thick. Pynchon's vision and nostalgia are summed into this genius slogan from May 68 events in Paris. As for the movie, well, it is almost impossible to review. There's too much going on in. I thought it was the finest and most complex blend of comedy, drama, historical, cultural and political recalls I have seen in years. It is utterly funny if you do not mind not catching every bit of the plot. Some shots and most of the dialogues are truly beautiful, every single moment involving Shasta in particular. You will need to pay attention at the details, at what's going on in the background and offscreen. I can only urge you to go see it.",2015
9,"""Inherent Vice"" is the first outright comedy that Paul Thomas Anderson has made and it's only the second film he's made based on someone else's work, (in this case Thomas Pynchon, whose dialogue he has faithfully reproduced). Consequently the film has been somewhat side-lined and underrated so while it may not be ""Magnolia"", ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""The Master"" it is still head and shoulders above anything else out there at the moment. The plot may be virtually impenetrable, (but then who gives a toss about plot these days), yet as a snapshot of a drug-fueled LA in 1970 this is close to priceless. If Anderson was Altman in a previous life then this is his ""The Long Goodbye"" by way of Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"".",2015
10,"When my friends and I went to the cinema just a few days ago, we didn't know what to expect. I, at least, had heard about Pynchon and knew what kind of an author he was, while my friends, on the other hand, had absolutely no way of knowing what they were getting themselves into. The movie started playing, and for a little while we weren't quite sure what to think. It took some time for us to get into the atmosphere and understand what we were actually dealing with here. Once we got it, we just started laughing. We fell silent. We laughed. And we kept on laughing throughout the film. And when I left the cinema and walked out on the street and took the train home and went to bed, I kept laughing to my self in the darkness. What was I laughing at? I'm not sure, but God damn was it funny. The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the music, the endless amount of new characters, everything about this movie makes a lasting impression. It is a movie in which every scene is memorable. And a movie you can keep on quoting again and again and again for ages with your friends, and still laugh about it. Rather elegantly it avoids jokes of poor taste, and focuses instead on a kind of black humor that will remind you of another time and another place, probably long before you were born. It's not for everyone, I'll admit that. Some people may not like it, and that's OK. But I reckon that this movie will be watched for years by a small but dedicated following. I won't be telling anything about the plot. You'll have to experience that for yourself. So all in all. The humor, the wit, the elegance, in my opinion this movie is an instant cult classic.",2015
3,"Anybody who is easily frustrated by a convoluted and incoherent movie plot should probably give 'Inherent Vice' a miss, otherwise the TV might not escape the two-and-a-half hours damage free. This film makes very little sense from the first scene to the last and the ridiculously long running length makes it even more difficult to endure. ",2017

10,"Now the thing about this film is, it's great. I stood in line for over 2hrs just to see this movie and wow what a pay off! This movie does few things movies do these days and that is be itself. It's this semi-ground breaking cinema that shows Paul Thomas Anderson is not scared to have fun and be serious at the same time and doesn't need to play it safe or do what you expect at the movies and neither is the original writer of the book Thomas Pynchon and boy are they a match! Now most people who see this film and those who won't like it are the same people that probably don't like or have even really read Pynchon, so let's forget about them and accept this for what it is a great film based on a good book by an amazing author. Joaquin phoenix is perfect as Larry Doc Sportello a stoner detective looking into the kidnappers of his ex-girls beau and real estate tycoon Mikey Wolfmann they both apparently just go missing and this leads Doc to a very many colorful character semi stereotypes of the 1960-1970's Era which all seem to center around something known as the golden fang what it is couldn't tell you, but what's apparent in this movie is the dying of a culture and all the things that go in between in late capitalism. Once when there was hope and promise once again now there is greed and control,the film is very deep and sad and romantic in this sense and the fact that no one saw it coming because they were all caught up and confused in smoky haze (as we in the audience are) it's sad because they are losing these hopes and promises, ""lost sight of"" maybe because of certain vices and only have to look forward to a grim future is what makes this films emotional center. The film kinda takes on the same dimensions as Doc's regular weed habits the funny bits are truly great, Phoenix is great at physical comedy him and Brolin are meant for each other and the other cast members just shine the few minutes when they are on screen honorable mention is Martian Short boy is he wild in this one! All in all this is the best I've seen all year this one defiantly takes some time and repeated viewings but like all great films There Will Be Blood included is worth the effort.",2014

Just absolutely boring and horrible. The actors looked so bored as they plodded through this horrible script, I almost felt sympathy for them. There was absolutely no energy or enthusiasm emanating from the screen. I can see why it tanked financially at the box office. Some movies set in the '70's are very entertaining and pleasurable to watch. This one was just painful. I don't usually write reviews, but this one was such a stinkbomb I had to put in my two cents worth.",2015
10,"Those who don't get it, will never get. Those who do get it, will have a ball. Inherent Vice is the most psychedelic film since Robert Downey Sr.'s ""Putney Swope"". It doesn't make sense.... It's really not supposed to make sense. It's delightfully confusing and eclectically bewildered in the fumes of it's own bong water. This isn't the same P.T.A. you knew from ""Boogie Nights"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". Here, he slams down on our heads a Thomas Pynchon book, and laughs at us for not getting it. It's a delicious assault on filmmaking. It's also a genius, loving tribute to the end of the Hippie revolution of America in the early 1970's. It may never win an Oscar, but it ought to be tried for the Palme D'or at Cannes. Uncompromisingly, I loved it.",2015
9,"Inherent Vice just doesn't give a f@#k. I don't mean that as anything more than an observation, and understand this as you watch the film because otherwise you'll be a little lost. The film just doesn't care whether you think this or that is good acting or a funny joke. It doesn't care what you think is happening. It will go on. Despite any perceived awkwardness, it will continue to be itself... and there is awkwardness.",2015
9,"Wow!Just finished watching Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film ""Inherent Vice"" and thought it was incredible!At it's heart it's a 70's film noir that captures the spirit and feel of the 70's perfectly but in it's whole it is sooo much more than that.It's a rumble tumble roller coaster of a watch that whilst conveying a sense of the main protagonists tenuous drug fuelled grasp on what is going on still manages to maintain a coherent narrative right to the end.It's got elements of classic film noir,70's counter culture movies (the voice over reminds me both of classic noir and the radio station from ""Vanishing Point""),70's ""cinema of the paranoid"" and dashes of ""The Big Lebowski"".All the while there's an underlying religious parable, (that I think I'm gonna have to watch it again to fully grasp what he was getting at) with one image in particular mirroring ""The Last Supper"", themes of resurrection and many other little references and images relating to Christian dogma.To top it all off one character virtually transforms into a metaphor for ""the man"" (which he always was throughout the film but it's just more blatant in the scene I'm referring to) without it seeming clumsy or forced.Oh god.Love,love loved this film!",2015

Speaking of Pace, the guy has presence and this attractive intensity about him that makes for a dynamic character. Also, already showing good character development, good plot devices, and intrigue. I always found the history of the evolution of computers and the internet and cell phones to be fascinating, and this looks to be another engaging foray into that often inaccessible world. They even manage to explain the technical and legal jargon well enough. On an unrelated note, I can't get over the fact that I think Mackenzie Davis is a dead ringer for a young Robin Wright. Looks like she could be the American Lisbeth Salander albeit with just a tad bit less edge. Decent music too, and I love anything 80's anyways.

I really wanted to see this series because it would depict all the exiting innovations and dramatic battles what I have witnessed up close. And that have influenced my life greatly. . I've watched all 3 seasons now, reluctantly. And I must say, I'm *very* disappointed. Sure, the series is well made, and the acting is okay. But the main subject of the series, the tech industry, is almost completely pushed aside by unnecessary personal drama. The ""soap opera"" tactics, used to make this series interesting for a broader audience I presume, include: 1 Numerous inter-colleague affairs, 2 Bi-sexuality, 3 Life threatening illness, 4 Suicide, 5 Major crimes, 6 Always working behind each others backs, 7 Never listening to reason, never consult beforehand, 7 always make your life-changing decision in a snap. It's like watching ""As the World Turns"" with some tech thing happening once in a while. . Come on, script writers, you are better than this! You don't need all this cr*p to make it good. The tech industry has plenty of drama to make it interesting in itself. It's brutal, exciting, and even wrecks personal lives... Please do a better job for the next season and stick to the subject. Thank you.",2017

The show has everything from corporate intrigue, personal rivalry, clashing visions, and historic technological developments. Over all I loved how they were able to stay loyal to the historic era from clothes to cars to hairstyles. To conclude this is a highly addictive story and character development is excellent. Very much looking forward to season 2, this is a must watch!!!",2015
8,"I was initially skeptical of the goofy title, but ultimately grew to really like this show. (Ended up joining mid-season, and binge-watching 5 episodes in one night.) For anyone who lived through the early 80's and the computer developments of that time, it's an interesting show, with interesting, complicated, realistic characters. I personally like it more than Breaking Bad or Mad Men (though not as much as True Detective.",2014
7,"From watching just one episode, I'm intrigued enough to watch another. Although I'm hardly a computer specialist, I do admit that I've always been fascinated by the technology. I'm old enough to remember when they were purchased for the workplace and you had to learn commands and operate A & B drives using floppy disks. No internet. Out with the secretaries and IBM selectrics. You had to write your own reports and letters.",2014
8,"I wrote a review, decided against the usefulness, reread the other reviews and decided to rewrite a review! I did live through the ""80's tech era"", in case there may be doubt. My computer programming assignments in college were completed on an IBM model with a floppy disk to boot. This first episode performed its duties well. If I had no knowledge of this generation of computers, I would still understand the take off point for this series. I have also started to form a personal opinion of these characters. The storyline is very easy to follow and it has the usual bad guys and good guys although I have not determined which slot to put all of them in yet. The characters were developed enough to start forming opinions but I am far from completing them. The groundwork has been laid for an entertaining David and Goliath story. I would hate to compare a show to another after just one airing however this reminds me of the movies, Erin Brockovich and The Rainmakers, etc. As I previously stated, however, there are many directions this could take and I will be investing my time to see which one they decide on.",2014
9,"What AMC did here is take a guaranteed formula like Mad Men, replaced the advertising firm with a computer one, and ""voila"". Don't get me wrong, Halt does it's own thing most of the time so its fresh, but there is a clear correlation. Lee Pace is essentially Jon Hamm (Draper) a big thinking salesman with a few more character flaws. The ""job conflicting with family"" dynamic though is switched onto his assistant, a computer software engineer, Scoot Mcnairy. Our third main star is the lanky Mackenzie Davis, who plays Cameron, a computer whiz kid who is the most ambitious, focused, and cynical of them all.",2014
4,"I was ready to bail on HALT AND CATCH FIRE after the first couple of episodes. The pilot's curious promise of sort of a wild west frontier angle set in the silicon prairie gave way to a maddening series of episodes that hinted of something happening and then once again grinding to a halt. An exasperating tug-of-war that made me wonder if the writers had a blueprint for the season's trajectory. So I have no clue why I stuck it out to completion; I'm guessing some perverse hope that it'd get better. It didn't. It's uncharacteristic of me; I bailed much earlier on with MAD MEN (HALT's comparisons to that show are unavoidable, to its detriment), which is why I can't explain why I hung on til the end. ",2014
5,"This TV show had so much potential. It has great, beautiful actors. Set in the best technological booms of our time. But it has so many flaws.",2017
9,I have spent the past several months binge watching the four seasons of this series and enjoyed the way in which this program developed. I hated to see the last episode of the fourth season air and would have loved to have had more episodes yet to watch! Great job by all of the cast members. Everyone played well off one another.,2017
4,"I watched first two seasons and took most of it with a grain of salt. Reportedly based on true story but I don't buy it. Too much pc baloney. I liked season 1. Season 2 was okay. Season 3 was painful to watch. Gay guy, 2 women and a poor nerd engineer. Yep this is what started the tech boom and all the explosion of the internet? Sorry not only don't I buy it I know it bares no resemblance to actual history. Kind of like a lot of stuff nowadays. Pretentious garbage. I honestly couldn't find a single character I could relate to or root for other than the poor Texan everyone takes for granted. Not much on TV worth watching any more. This series needed to end last season. Dragging it out another season lost me.",2017
4,"The show started off really great with interesting plot. However, the Cameron and Joe drama keeps coming back to a point that we know something is going to go wrong eventually. Cameron's character should be killed off. There is just nothing going on there. We know she will screw things up eventually for everyone and blame everyone else for it. Such a useless character, bringing down the tempo whole show.",2017
1,"Unfortunately the story immediately drifts too far left in the unnecessary opening scene of episode 1. Sex between strangers in a back room --is hardly part of what was probably in reality a great historical docudramedy-- almost made me end it right there. Almost again during episode 2. But now I've stopped forever at mid-episode 3, now that a lead character (from the afore- mentioned scenes) goes openly Bi. Most of us don't want or need this. Not every story has gays or needs a southpark ""T"" gay. Nor does it need constant sex. It just not real.",2017
6,"Working in the tech industry and remembering the days of the TRS-80 and Apple II+ I couldn't wait to see a Mad Men format for the dawn of technology. There's no need to give fact checks; like throwing out tech words that weren't in common use till 20 years later, they are fun to hear and imagine. ",2014
9,"I have watched the first two episodes and I like this series so far. Like Mad Men before it I love watching recent history period piece series that we already know the outcome of the product or products that they are developing. My favorite part so far is when the guy suggests that the computers be ""portable"" and that he wants them to develop one that weighs only ""15 lbs"" and the who room goes crazy and starts to say how that can never be. :) The characters are still a little confusing since they are still developing before us, but that is to be expected.I do love how the one character who is the boss will definitely soon to be known as a dinosaur. He is gruff and thinks that he knows everything, and doesn't seem to want to move into the future. I will continue to watch this one. I think this is going to be good. Thanks, AMC for more good programming!",2014
4,When H&CF started it looked very promising and was hopefully going to give us an insight in the early days of computing. Season 1 fulfilled this aspect and season 2 too. But thereafter the Bad started creeping in and at the beginning of season 4 it has gone to Worse.,2017
9,"Well, this show really caught my attention. The music, consumer products, clothing, attitudes are all very 80s. They nailed it with the exception of a few commonly used phrases from right now. ",2015
8,"The show oscillates, but not extremely, in its goodness from show to show. It stays pretty busy making references and acknowledgments to those who will be watching intently for it, but still feels blurry in the tech time-line. ",2014
1,"The show starts off great, with a sexy make it or break it story line. Season 3 slows down. Season 4 is slow slow slow, and all the sex appeal is gone. The Cameron character should be killed off, and the whole venture capital firm is just boring. I am not wasting another hour on this show, and neither should you.",2017
3,"This show is about the birth/growth of the personal computing and the internet. It revolves around the work of a handful of characters, mixed with their personal drama. Looking back I wish I hadn't watched this series at all. The characters keep striving to be on the cutting edge, but the viewer is never really given the satisfaction when they reach their goals. Their achievements are glossed over, and the viewer is left underwhelmed. ",2017
7,"Hercules and chums are mercenaries, pressed into service for Lord Cotys to put down a rebel uprising which looks likely to overthrow the throne.",2014
8,"For those wanting a 'genuine' mythology Hercules; this is not the movie for you. For those wanting a dark and realistic take on Hercules; this is not really the movie for you. For those hoping for popcorn fare, a little gory for a ten year old but just about right for a 13 or 14 year old, for those hoping for solid acting performances, well-choreographed fight scenes, and pretty high production values, then this is your show. And it's got a strong positive message that even those put off by the occasional splash of blood, the fleeting glimpse of bare female bottom, or the single comic use of the 'F' word would agree is something the American public occasionally needs to hear. Is it sort of formulaic? Yeah. So what? There are plenty of formulaic movies that have risen above stereotype into archetype. This isn't one of them, but it was worth the price of admission and the time spent. I'm glad Johnson got this movie done, and glad that I watched it.",2015
7,"A lot of people went into this movie with expectations that this would follow the mythology, and I think that's what let them down. However, as an artistic representation of not only the myths, but a possible truth behind the myths, this was an entertaining watch.",2014
8,"This film was a real surprise to me. I was expecting something that was a cross between Kevin Sorbo's TV show and Wrath of the Titans. But the producers chose a completely different direction for this re-telling. Aside from the shorts at the beginning we see no monsters. Nor do we see beautiful gods and goddesses. Hercules' greatest enemy in this story is the very real (and human) threat of betrayal and treachery. And rather than a one man- show, we see Hercules aided by a band of loyal friends who are every bit as skilled as the demigod. The film raises the question what is more important: what others believe of you or what you believe about yourself? The film has a bevy of great actors including John Hurt, Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell and I think Dwayne Johnson is perfect for the main role.",2014
6,"Firstly, the film has a slow start. We see almost motion comic footage of Hercules doing his 12 labours in slideshow form, with Hercules face hidden in silhouette. So I felt a little cheated. Then we have a scene which tries to set up what makes this version of the main character different than any other version we have seen before. I wont give it away, as its basically what the film is about. But it tries to play with our knowledge of him. ",2014
6,"I went to see Hercules with little to no expectations. The main reason was that I needed some cheesy summer flick to laugh at, and the movie's trailer did promise this kind of stuff. Well, the movie did not disappoint - indeed, it was cheesy, but in such a self-aware way, that it falls out of the ""so bad that it's good"" category and gets into the ""simply good"" one. Irony is dominant through the whole 98 minutes, and there are plenty of minor and major plot twists, albeit not a single forced one. And the story is delivered in an entertaining way without any unnecessary melodrama or heroism - a nice change from most of Hollywood big-budget action flicks.",2014
8,Grettings from Lithuania.,2014
5,"Look, I know going into a Brett Ratner film starring The Rock as Hercules shouldn't have expectations high, but I expected more from this. Right from the start of the film we are immersed into a world without character development and rushed story telling. ",2014
4,Hello fellow movie lovers. This review contains spoilers.,2014
2,"If you're a fan of the Mythology of Hercules in any way, shape or form and expect to see it in this film, you will be sorely disappointed. This film has pulled a complete ""World-War-Z"" and left absolutely EVERYTHING about the original mythology out except for the fact that it is called ""Hercules"". ",2014
9,"Now I know a lot of people are bashing this movie apart. Basically people are going to see this movie thinking that its following the mythology of Hercules. That's what most people were let down by,its more close the mythology but this flick is based on a comic book (I never read the comics but I know this because it was on Wikipedia,its called Hercules : The Thracian wars by Radical) The story was well paced and good, maybe goofy at sometimes but it was well put and solid.",2014
1,"First review I have written. I have never been so moved to review a movie until now. I am not sure if the movie has more clichés or plot holes in it, but there are a ton of both. I would have preferred a movie just showing Hercules defeating his 12 labors. The highlight of the movie was the first 5 minutes summarizing the 12 labors Hercules faced. Instead we are given a ridiculous story of Hercules as a mercenary after his family's death. He is hired to lead an army against rebels. The reality the rebels are the good guys and he was fooled. Cliché? Ergenia, the King's daughter could have simply paid Hercules to kill her Father. That would have been a simple task, seeing as he had no army at that point. Anyway I could list a ton of issues with the movie but the biggest one I would like to point out is the appearance of King Eurystheus at the end of the movie. The man turns out to be the murderer of Hercules' family. He is nowhere in the movie at all except for one flashback which showed him briefly. Yet this ""King"" shows up at the end of the movie when Hercules is captured. So you are telling me...Sometime after returning that day from a major war and during celebrations King Eurystheus showed up to Thrace knowing that Hercules wouldn't leave with the gold? This King traveled to Thrace with just 3 murderous dogs? None of his own soldiers to protect him? What King does that?",2014
7,"There's nothing worse than a film that's completely clichéd in every way. Or at least I thought so until I watched 'Hercules.' It's absolutely everything you've seen a thousand times before, therefore it's a mystery as to why I enjoyed it as much as I did.",2014
7,"OK the trailer said this wasn't the legend we had heard. But the trailer did showcase mythical creatures and implied we would still see ""The Son of Zeus""",2014
10,"This is my first review ever. I had to start because i want to give good movies justice! This Hercules movie is refreshing and a new take on Hercules. It is a TRUE hybrid take of Hercule's as a man and a ""god""...not just your typical demigod, clash of titans, gods beaming in and out, angels flying down to help... type movies. If your expecting those, you would be disappointed. Instead this takes a look of Hercules as a man (I am trying really hard not to spoil the movie here!). It is promoting good morals, that often times how we are is what we make of ourselves. ",2014
7,"""Hercules"" starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson absolutely delivers on its promise to be entertaining. I went into this film with half-hearted expectations, thinking that Dwayne Johnson wouldn't fit the part well, I fully expected this to be an entire film of blood and fighting. This is far from correct. The writers of this film are fantastic going for almost ""A knight's tale"" vibe to it with a ton of comedy. I honestly found myself laughing out loud much more than I found myself getting drilled with constant WWE style fighting like there was in ""The legend of hercules"", mind you this is a very good thing. The laid back style of this film is what makes it so great, sadly this film failed in the box office, hopefully folks can see the potential and eat it up on bluray/DVD.",2014
1,"I went into this movie with high expectations as I've enjoyed most of The Rock's movies and I am a huge childhood fan of Hercules (the old movies, not the Kevin Sorbo series) and I hoped this would be a return to the glory days of Hercules. Instead we have tired old cornball stereotype a la Steven Spielberg at his most nauseating with the smarmy kid, the athletic girl, the wise old cornball, the loyal dog-boy, and the capable friend. There is a suggestion of Hercules being a fraud and his ""disciples"" around him being the root of his mythic status with the little PT Barnham kid endlessly hocking everything Hercules does. The fights scenes are a couple steps back in technology as I have no idea how you could release this movie in light of the stupefying fight scenes delivered in say the ""300"" movies. The Rock wears what looks like a child's training bra for a chest-plate for nearly the entire movie despite the fact that the chest muscle rests somewhere around his collar bone. Everything about this movie is superficial, adolescent, and about the level of a low budget Saturday morning cartoon... on public television. This is career ending bad. The kind of bad that sticks to you and follows you around. Brett Ratner's feeble direction in this crap-fest succeeded tremendously in ruining everyone's career involved in it. Ishtar should thank God this movie was made as now it can rest peacefully knowing some unfortunate incompetent souls have somehow managed to save it from being the worst movie of all time.",2014
10,"I give this film ten simply because it was way up there for sheer entertainment, with no over the top blood and gore , something I find mostly completely uneccessary. It made me laugh when it was meant to and it had that 'Saturday morning pictures'(sorry all those under 60years old) feel of excitement without any of the cheap sensationalism which so many films seem to employ these days.Maybe others call it cheesy but I actually like it when the good guys win(a certain George Lucas made quite a success of that). So if you like the poster(Dwain never looked better) you want to be entertained for 98minuites without having to work too hard, I'm gonna say this is an excellent (maybe great) movie and I will check back in to see it again tomorrow. Oh yes and it has two movie moments which are superb in my view, I leave you too work out what they are but they both involved the 'Rock' at his best even if he did need to swear for one of them, it was worth it, and the other, well Heros always have to emerge from clouds of smoke or flames or some such and given how hard the man worked to get himself looking right I reckon he does one of the best emergence ever, go and enjoy it, and watch Tinker ,Taylor, Soldier, Spy another day.",2014
6,"(58%) A movie that could have quite easily dipped into crap territory is saved by well directed and plentiful action, good production values, Mr Johnson being a perfect leading man, John hurt calling Hercules a ""filthy bastard"" and ""Atalanta"" (bow-girl) looking uncannily like Nicole Kidman from the early 90's. The fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously is a benefit, but I'd have liked the script to be a little stronger and the humour to be sharper, as it does stop this from being a full recommendation from me. That said it's still a decent little watch that gets better as the plot thickens in it's second half, but before that arrives it's just a little too dumb to grab my full attention.",2014
8,"If this had been headlined by anyone other than Dwayne Johnson then I'm not sure I'd have turned up at the cinema. Even then it was a bit touch and go. What could this sword and sandals flick offer that wasn't already covered by many others the last fifteen years? It turns out Hercules is pretty unique in its attempt to say something important about the world we live in, layered beneath the many coloured imagination of director Brett Ratner and the needs of a PG12 rating.",2014
2,I had zero expectations but my sister forced me to accompany her to watch this. It was literally worse than I thought it would be.,2014
3,"If you've seen the trailer of Hercules and think ""I must see this' .. well think again. ",2014
5,"At first I didn't think ""The Rock"" would make a good Hercules, but once I saw the film I couldn't say anything negative about him. The demi-god is after all not big on words, and this is not Shakespeare. Plus, he's got the physical attributes and the persona to pull off this job. The movie producers did a good job putting on the screen what this historical period must have looked like, and the effects are not bad at all. It was also a pleasure to see some good actors playing nasty: Fiennes and Hurt were very effective, and they chewed the scenery when required.",2014
6,"《Hercules》Rating: 6 per 10 ""In order to be a hero, you must first believe you are a hero."" -Muscular Dwayne Johnson is Hercules. ",2014
10,"I cannot praise this series enough. It has an air of realism about it from its location to the main actors. The lead sergeant Catherine Cawood and her sister are so ordinary, preoccupied with ordinary things, (no trendy,smarmy,clever middle class media interpretations of what ordinary people speak like dialog). Without exception every character is believable. With master classes in acting from the lead, her sister, her grandson and Tommy the maniac. The criminals are believably cruel and stupid in measure. The damaged and unfortunate are portrayed realistically but with compassion. No left wing idealism or right wing coldness that usually invades these type of program. The setting is the bleakest place I've ever seen, a beautiful English valley shrouded in mist, dampness and high rises. The streets and buildings are claustrophobic. Most of all the story is credible, consistent and finely paced. raw emotions are not avoided and dysfunction is everywhere. And yet there's something noble in sergeant Catherine Cawood.",2014
10,"I've been thoroughly enjoying this dark gritty drama. All the leads are excellent, but Sarah Lancashire as the main police officer with a tragic family history, is outstanding. It started well then just got better and better with each episode and twist of the plot (and screw) having me on the edge of my seat. I've just watched what must be the penultimate episode and it has left me physically shaking - it was that convincing and shocking. It's hard to credit the complaint of mumbling by one reviewer. I can't recall even one line of script I didn't follow and it's usually something that bugs me. I'm so glad I've watched this series, it's got to be one of (if not the) best TV dramas of 2014.",2014
9,"This drama series is indescribably good. What takes place in the first 10 min of episode 3 has left me, a very brave and unflinching movie/TV watcher, shocked to the core. I was so upset that I had to pause the show to regain my composure. Sarah Lancashire's portrayal of Catherine Cawood is leaving me in awe and I find myself counting the days to the next episode. It is impossible not to feel her passion for policing, her incredible pain at the lost of her daughter and the disappointment she has in her failed marriage and ex husband. The fury I feel towards Kevin Weatherill for his stupid and selfish act that culminates in the horror that is this show, is testament to Steve Pemberton's brilliant acting. If you do not watch this series you are seriously missing out on maybe the best ever detective show made in the UK.",2014
9,"I've only just realised what a great actress Sarah Lancashire is (I last saw her as a dizzy blonde in Coronation Street!). In the whole range of the Happy Valley character its the silences, those long lingering close-ups of her face as it conveys everything she doesn't have to say. One minute you feel sorry for the poor sod; next your laughing at the characters directness; next your almost in tears as she drives to hold herself together in the face of crippling memories. The story itself it terrific but sitting in the middle is Catherine Cawood, the dedicated, honest, seen-it-all-before, no-nonsense copper. The writer who opened the story with the confrontation with a smack-head allowed some cracking dialogue to kick the series off and show us the character we will grow to like and care for. The BAFTA's hers!",2014

10,"Absolutely incredible Drama with a capital ""D"". Please tell me they are talking with Sarah Lancashire about a second series.I look forward to seeing Sarah, the cast and production team at all the award ceremonies this year.BRILLIANT!! and we have only seen 4 episodes. The locations, the camera work,the wardrobe and the realistic make up all combine to give the episode such realism it is at times genuinely frightening.In my experience fear generated when watching TV comes only with groundbreaking drama of the highest order. The cast leave me breathless with admiration at such fine performances from all involved but like all great team efforts there is one shining light giving a career best performance as Catherine Cawood that is Sarah Lancashire.",2014
10,"The most intense, well written, well acted crime series I've ever seen on television. For six weeks I've been hooked on a story that uses a police drama as a framework for the human emotions that are at the core of this fantastic series. Steve Pemberton (The League of Gentlemen, Inside No 9) as the self-interested accountant out of his depth when a kidnapping plot goes horribly wrong was brilliant and James Norton was easily one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a television drama. There was real depth to his character and I expect he was hated by viewers as much as Joffre in Game of Thrones nonsense police officer. But it was Sarah Lancashire's show all the way as the tough, no-nonsense, but damaged police officer. At first I thought this was going to go the way of the film Fargo, with it's kidnapping-gone-wrong scenario, but by the start of the second episode it was clear that it was going to take a different path. Be warned though, it's dark and unsettling with moments of sudden shocking violence, especially at the end of the fourth episode, where I was left shaking at the sheer intensity of it all. Better than anything American crime dramas have had to offer us over the past year, it was brilliant. Absolutely bloody brilliant!",2014
10,"Happy Valley......not for most of the residents! The BBC tend to (every now and then) come up with a block busting drama series. This one had (and has) me gripped to my seat from the start. Clever interaction between all the cast and 'Superb' acting on the part of every actor/actress including Corrie's Sarah Lancashire and Benidorm's Steve Pemberton. Great Yorkshire setting, the atmosphere oozes out of every brick & stone. Edge of the seat stuff, every episode ending in a cliff hanger.. Please let there be more BBC, you do have an awful habit of killing of great drama series just when everyone is hooked (e.g. Garrow's Law). Bring on season two please (writer) Sally Wainwright",2014
10,"I thought 'Scott & Bailey"" to be extraordinary - and it is - but ""Happy Valley"" is gut wrenching, heart stopping, uncomfortable, and totally, totally brilliant. Firstly, nothing of quality can be created without a very good script, and Sally Wainwright's script is her best yet, and rivals her Scott & Bailey scripts. The dialogue crackles with its own rhythm, and sharp observations of modern life, while the emerging story is all at once shocking as it is at times ordinary.",2014
10,"One day Mr S.Pemberton will be recognised for the superb actor that he is.In ""Benidorm"" he plays the outwardly crass Garvey paterfamilias as a completely believable bloody - minded Manc,but his performance slowly reveals him to be a loving husband and father frustrated by his inability to articulate his emotions. From ""The League of Gentlemen"" to ""Inside No.9"" he has displayed the ability to act and perform comedy outside the box and in ""Happy Valley"" he has reached a new level as an embittered accountant who conceives a plan to hold his boss's daughter for ransom after being refused a pay rise.He passes the plan on to a local villain then finds his boss has changed his mind. Horror - stricken,he goes to the local nick where he meets sympathetic Sgt Cawood(the equally inspired Miss S.Lancashire),but runs off before she can get the truth out of him. Sgt Cawood has what you might call ""issues"" as her daughter committed suicide after giving birth to a child as a result of rape.Incidentally,she is buried in a graveyard near Sylvia Plath.Not surprisingly the child has ""issues"" too as does Sgt Cawood's sister(The mighty Miss S Finneran - Mrs Garvey in ""Benidorm"" -who is a recovering heroin addict. But please don't think that ""Happy Valley"" is a drama that disappears up it's own self - pitying bottom because all the women are too tough for that particular cliché to apply. Instead they front it out as the rapist is released from prison,gets a job with the local bad guy who is engineering the kidnapping and proceeds to rape the victim. Miss Lancashire is the best,toughest and cleverest female cop since Miss Frances McDormand in ""Fargo"".It would never surprise me if in the end she didn't feed the rapist into a woodchipper.I certainly don't fancy his chances of staying alive,let alone free. What with ""Happy Valley"" and the female - led ""The Crimson Field"",the BBC are leading TV drama out of its male - dominated somewhat patriarchal comfort - zone and giving us some real warts and all portraits of women who are not content to make tea and cakes while hubby rides home on the 4.55.from Victoria.",2014
10,I have just finished watching the series and I must clarify now. I am a cynical person just looking to find fault with television or film.,2014
10,"I cannot fault this Police/Crime drama. The writer has proved again, as with Scott and Bailey she has a feel for UK Policing and the consequences for the victims, offenders and officers involved of the crime. I was pretty much in tears at one point following one of the scenes and was astonished at how amazing Sarah Lancashires' performance was. Thiswas truly BAFTA material all round with faultless performances that's why 10/10. I sincerely hope they do not have a second series but let this remain a one off spectacular piece of TV. I understand a second series has been discussed but why would you risk blemishing a perfectly constructed drama?",2014
10,Kevin Weatherill is an ordinary man doing an ordinary job as an accountant; he is not happy man though; he wants to send his daughter to a private school but his boss refuses to give him a raise. When he sees that another client is dealing drugs he comes up with a plan he will get this man to kidnap his boss's daughter and use the ransom to pay the school fees. This man agrees and the plan is set in motion. Keven later changes his mind but by now it is too late the girl is about to be kidnapped by a couple of men; including the thoroughly unpleasant ex-con Tommy Lee Royce. Royce is already known to the police; most notably Sgt Catherine Cawood; Royce raped her daughter leaving her pregnant but nothing could be proved. Following her daughter's suicide she is determined that Royce will get nowhere near her grandson and hopes to put him back in gaol as soon as possible she doesn't know about his latest offence though; nobody has reported the kidnap to the police an inaction that will have fatal consequences.,2014
10,"The fact that Sgt Catherine Cawood is not a real person but a character played by an actress is completely 100% inconceivable. The portrayal is SO real in every aspect. It's real in every mannerism, in the shift between her persona as a private person and police officer, in the way she dresses, the way she wears her hair, her make up, the choices she makes and how she behaves. I've never seen a performance like it in my life. So extremely vulnerable, yet so extremely strong and when push comes to shove so extremely brave and tough. I for one would not want to cross her, for she would surely kick my behind severely, at the same time I sure would want her to talk to if ever I was victimized.",2016
10,"The best thing on TV since Broadchurch, and it may even have the edge. Sarah Lancashire's performance is the glue that holds the whole story together, but every character is painted in broad strokes without a cliché among them.",2014
9,"My wife and I were surfing the net one lazy Sunday afternoon and I found Happy Valley on Netflix. BBC television frequently has shows we enjoy so we pulled it up and began watching the series. It's started off slow and it takes a bit to catch up with the language and how it flows but we're good at understanding the dialog. The longer we watched the more we became engrossed in the story line. I'm a retired cop after 30 years on the job and yes there were some minor flaws in basic cop stuff but I'm forgiving ....it's a show, not reality. The writing and acting were impeccable. The story flows and the many strands of the story began to come into one main story. We recommend you just sit and watch as it unfolds, you will enjoy the story. The individual actors had their characters spot on and really developed their individualism. Human behavior and rationalization of ones actions were mingled throughout the characters. Despicable, weak minded individuals, criminal types and then the sociopath one that really stands out from the minor league criminals...it's all in this show. Honestly, we watched the entire series ( 6 hours ) in one afternoon and evening. I've already checked and noted that the BBC has renewed the show for another season so we can see the Sergeant build her character even more, along with the supporting cast.",2014
10,"I saw the trailer for this series thinking it would be your average BBC attempt at making yet another piece of sh*t crime drama, but upon watching the first episode I was amazed by how similar it is to my life in Halifax. Drugs are everywhere, everyone is doing them or has a relative who is, alike our main character Catherine with her druggie of a sister, I myself have several druggie relatives that are woven deep into the crime underworld of West Yorkshire, I love how accurate this show is and hope that the next season is just as good, I have no problems with this show whatsoever and only wish that it's next season has a deeper insight into life in the valley and how Drugs play such a key role in many peoples lives around here.",2015
10,"This is without a doubt the best mini-series I have ever watched in my 77 years. Sarah Lancashire is an amazing actress and certainly deserves more attention than she has received. The rest of the cast down to those with the least screen time also give flawless performances. Normally dispassionate while watching a movie, I learned to hate the villain, which means that his performance was also amazing.",2015
9,"I don't know where to start from but if you are looking for an intense well acted, well directed, unique and an intense plot-line this is for you. I loved the complexity of the main character and the actress totally nailed the role. A great thing about this series is how the characters felt very real and flawed just like people in real life. There is decent amount of violence. I hope more people get to see the series cause it has great potential. This series deserves as much recognition and praise as True Detective to be honest. I am sure if it were on HBO people would have been going crazy about it. Cinematography is great too.",2015
8,"I decided some time ago that I would try more new programmes, including those that do not necessarily have recognisable names in the cast, and this was one of those shows I spotted, and I'm really glad I did. Basically set in the valleys of West Yorkshire, Catherine Cawood (Coronation Street's Sarah Lancashire) is a strong-willed police sergeant, over time she has tried to come to terms with the suicide of her daughter, who left behind a nephew, who lives with her and her sister Clare Cartwright (Downton Abbey's Siobhan Finneran). Kevin Weatherill (Steve Pemberton) is accountant who asks for more money from his boss Nevison Gallagher (George Costigan) to help his daughters get into good schools, but when Nevison refuses Kevin decides to get Ashley Cowgill (Joe Armstrong) to orchestrate a kidnapping of Nevison's daughter Ann (Charlie Murphy). It is only at the last minute that Kevin finds out this kidnapping would not need to happen, with Nevison considering an increase in his money, but it is too late, Ashley and drug offender Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) kidnap Ann and keep her locked and tied up, demanding £1,000,000 from Nevison ransom. Kevin and Nevison do not report the kidnapping to the police, and Kevin tells his wife Jenny (Julia Ford) of the situation, all they can think of doing is keeping the ransom money he receives, but slowly Catherine becomes involved with the crime as she becomes suspicious of Tommy, who she has seen around, and she knows his criminal record. Catherine blames Tommy for her daughter's suicide, after he raped her and made her pregnant, eventually the secret kidnapping is discovered by Catherine and the police, and the situation becomes increasingly dangerous when Tommy finds out he is the father to the Catherine's nephew and he gets closer to the child. Also starring Shane Zaza as Shafiq Shah, Adam Long as Lewis Whippey, Rhys Connah as Ryan Cawood, Jill Baker as Helen Gallagher, Derek Riddell as Richard Cawood, Ishia Bennison as Joyce, Hannah John-Kamen as Justine, Amer Nazir as Twiggy and Kelly Harrison as Ros Cawood. Lancashire gives a great performance as the determined police woman, usually in comedy Pemberton proves himself as a great serious actor, and the other members of the cast all play their parts well too. I have seen a few kidnap dramas before, but this one was written and performed so well that it flowed with realism, all six episodes were really gripping, and it was not afraid to be controversial with its shocking scenes, including swearing, rape and violence, I'm not surprised a second series is being considered, a brilliant crime drama. Very good!",2014
10,"Binge-watching the series on Netflix over two days, I was drawn to make favorable comparisons with several classic dramas.",2014
10,"This series is the best thing I have seen on TV bar none. Sarah is a fabulous actress. It is almost impossible to think of her other than as her character. The rest of the cast is of similar caliber. They call some others ""reality shows"" but this series is the real reality show. The writing is so good as to be totally believable, and the performances beyond reproach. Please make as many episodes as humanly possible. It will be hard to wait for another season but some one has to do it! I use subtitles to be sure not to miss dialogue. More episodes please! I wish they could make these faster so I could access it every single evening. Perhaps I will have to wait a bit til the details of season one blur a bit so I could successfully re watch it.",2016

8,"For some reason when I was watching this BBC series (now streaming on Netflix) I kept thinking Sgt Catherine Cawood as an older and cantankerous version of Adele. The physical resemblance is not only there for all to see, but even the ""fug-care"" personality fits. This is an Adele with no more hit songs in her and the world has forgotten who she was. This is an Adele who then goes on an everyday eating spree, angry with the world and then she becomes a detective in a small town in England. Yeah! I can totally see that!",2015
8,When I first saw this pop up on Amazon Instant Video I was skeptical as I had never watched an Amazon exclusive television series before. And I was well aware of the popularity of rival-Netflix's exclusives and found it hard to believe it would be a worthy competitor.,2015
10,"Let me say first of all that I enjoy classical music, and I enjoy the bohemian lifestyle associated with musicians and artists. This show is fresh, sarcastic, real and completely lacks the common areas that of sex and violence so over used on TV and movies. It is beautiful because the acting, the music and the geniality of ""Rodrigo"", the Maestro who is played by Gael Garcia Bernal.",2016
9,"I blew through this show in two days, and no just because of the quick, witty writing and 30-minute episodes. Seriously, though, a show that can be captivating and under an hour scores it at least 8/10 points. ",2014
10,"Like many of us, I had recently finished a series on Netflix/Prime a couple of days before and couldn't find another series to start. After losing hope, and about to re-watch an older series just to have something to watch, i stumbled across ""Mozart in the Jungle"" on Prime. Not the typical type of series i look for, but bored and out of options, I gave it a shot. After the first few minutes I was sold. A show i had never heard of, and had zero expectations of, surprised me. The episodes are only twenty some minutes so I ended up binge watching the entire season that night. I now want to grab the book the show is based off. And I am highly anticipating the next season.",2014
10,This was a fantastically insightful show with brilliant performances and witty writing. It was hilarious and showed a positive use of classical music in modern social settings. The characters were very realistic and showed both the camaraderie and competitive dualities within close working musicians. ,2014
10,"I started watching Mozart in the Jungle with a little trepidation. I love Mozart's music, and was a bit worried that his name has been used in the title in vain. My expectations were very low, the kind a true classical musician has when listening to someone non-musician analyzing their performance. My thoughts were: oh , here we go, someone again is going to humiliate the classical music and it's followers, and mix it up with shallow observations and cheap talk. I expected pop, rap, rock, house, bebop, and even disco, glorifications and total dismissal of all classical. How luckily wrong I was!! These series are probably one of the best and closest presentations of classical musicians' struggles to make it, to get known, to survive, to bare their soul for food, to do anything and everything and to forgo any pain and any doubt for the privilege to play music, to agree to any music job so they can live, and to serve and worship at the alter of music without any commercialism. It is a true presentation of the big egos of those who have made it, and the incredible beauty of the great big musicians' art. It is a true presentation of the little minds and the little talents whose only care is the union rules. It is a true presentation of how anything and everything in life can become music, how one can hear music even in the noise of a tire crossing bridge rims. And it is a very enjoyable, very funny, very well observed and cry well acted piece of TV! Congratulations to all the thinkers behind the scenes, all the makers of the series, all who acted brilliantly, all who performed the music brilliantly, and produced and brought this marvellous, surprising, unique series's to the general public! Can't wait for series 2!!",2015
6,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** I loved the first season. It was funny, full of music and heart-warming. I started watching it without high expectations, but really enjoyed it. I'd even go as far to say I had loved it. After seeing the first season I couldn't wait to watch the next one. ",2016
9,"What an enjoyable series! I'm looking forward to more. I happened to encounter an image for it as I was researching a project. Malcolm McDowell, Bernadette Peters, and the premise captured my attention. I'm so particular about what I watch that I often leave the TV off because of the degraded quality of programming on broadcast. Even cable has saturated itself with unscripted fare that clones other unscripted fare. Where's the creativity? Where's that something different? I found it on Amazon. The characters are important here, and I'm truly liking them because they are allowed to have shortcomings as much as they are allowed to soar with their strengths. They are not predictable; they are multidimensional.",2015
8,"This review is based on the first six episodes of the first season. I like this series so much that it's hard to see it objectively. I like it so much that I'm not bingeing but rather rationing myself to a meagre 25 or so minutes each day. So, what makes it quite so enjoyable? Firstly, it's genuinely good - a perfect cast delivering tonally perfect performances with a script that delivers reality plus a few extra percentage points. Occasionally, it's laugh out loud funny but mostly it's genuinely affecting. This is no guilty pleasure in which you know you're being manipulated but you're going along for the (very fun) ride. This always feels real, grounded. There are a few stereotypes amongst the smaller roles but the big ones, the roles that anchor this series, are well written and perfectly cast. Lola Kirke is a wonderful lightning rod, if gaining weight by the episode; Saffron Burrows is fine, if somewhat less interesting than in her pre plastic surgery roles; Bernadette Peters is terrific; Malcolm McDowell is the perfect exiting Maestro. And then there's Gael Garcia Bernal. As an outsider, I have no idea how much of his character was on the page and how much was his own invention but the results are spectacular. He makes this series. His portrayal of Rodrigo, the infant terrible of the conducting world, is nothing short of brilliant and creates, most appropriately, the bright star around which everything revolves. Mozart in the Jungle is not highbrow entertainment. It doesn't challenge or confront. It works its magic more subtly, and sometimes more effectively. It's a feel good show in the best possible way. Real, not fake. It likes its characters, for all their flaws. You could do worse.",2015
9,"I was looking for something new to watch since my favorite shows are all on a break and I had heard this show won awards. I was skeptical because classical music sounded like a snooze. I was so wrong about that!!! This is such a wonderful fun show. I love the characters especially Rodrigo. The music is wonderful and the story keeps you hooked. I highly recommend this new show. Give it a try, you won't be sorry. I am a huge fan of the show Nashville. I love shows that incorporate music into the story.It really adds so much to the all around experience, but you don't have to be a fan of the music to like the show.I dislike shows that take too long to get going and drag along. This show gets going fast and gets you interested right away. The acting is superb! Love it!!!",2016
8,"Fresh, unique and wickedly eccentric!!! I am guilty of ""Binge-Watching"" all 10 episodes and now find myself going through withdrawals! To let this series end here would be more tragic than the Italian opera Otello! Which coincidently one of the main character's name Roderigo closely resembles the same name of Maestro Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle! Not only is the writing superb, but all of the actors as well, regardless of the size of their parts. I've always been a fan of Gael Garcia Bernal and Malcolm McDowell, and Bernadette Peters is just as stunning and wonderful as she was many decades ago! But I'm really surprised by Lola Kirke! For a second I thought it was her sister Jemima from HBO's Girls because I was not familiar with Lola. And although she is the younger sister and not as well known, she certainly has just as much talent and it won't be long before everyone has heard of her too! Please Amazon give us more of this fantastic show and don't let it be canceled!!!",2015

4,"Entertaining show in the beginning, but losing grip every season.",2017
10,"Normally I do not like music especially orchestra and symphony... but because I like Gael Garcia Bernal works, I tried to convinced myself to watch the first episode of the series... I loved it a lot!! what a series... it is wonderful... it is not all about music... it is behind the curtain... the problems that are in all jobs... the story tells us we should not do the same thing or manner always the same... sometimes some changes are nice to cheerful the atmosphere of the work... it has magical affects to the work... I love the way Garcia performs... it is as if he is born a musician. all of the players of the film are fantastic in their roles... the script of the play is wonderful... in one scene Garcia the new leader of orchestra comes to the play with bike instead of elegant car... in one scene he wears a long red cloth around his head... sometimes when he speaks his performers and also the viewer first are in shock and then there is a smile in both sides... it says we can do even a serious thing in other ways than normal way... it is not end of the world, it just require ""belief in your heart"" always listen what your heart says... it conducts you trough the right way... I thank all the people who has made such wonderful piece of work... thanks again... Maryam Azizi",2015
6,"Have now gone through the third season. To sum it up pretty quickly, first several episodes of Season 3 showed promise.. but then the remainder of the series was overall flat. Season 3, Episode 4... what a mess.. nothing worked... it was embarrassing. Episodes one, two, and three introduced Monica's character, and she unquestionably carried them through. True the singing voice dubbing was definitely a weak point, outside of that the remainder of her work here was solid. And she helped partially save E4.. but only somewhat. Up till the middle of the third season, it could really have gone either way. But knocking out such a significant character/actor mid season was obviously going to leave a big space.. and regrettably none of the regular cast members have so far shown they can step up and fill the void. This is a show that needs big solid characters to carry the story-line, and as nice as most of the present cast member characters are, the production overall is now feeling weak.. it just needs more. The second half of the season does little to sustain interest. They would have done better to fall back on the tried and true of creating conflicting love interests for the leads... with solid three-way romances, many a floundering production has found renewed life for a period of time time.",2016
2,"Really really wanted to like this but it was such a disappointment. Had my first warning in the very first episode when someone said ""FLOO-tist"". About three episodes in and I realized they were going to portray every single musician as some neurotic, excruciatingly eccentric nut case and I knew it was doomed. The only character who isn't apparently a psychopath is the main girl and that's only because she's tediously dull and generic. It was just one outlandish plot line after another. I found the last episode especially laughable when a member of the orchestra is somehow prepared to step in and perform the Sibelius concerto when the actual soloist (yet another lunatic) storms off. Oh please. Throw in endless terrible musical instrument/sex double entendre and Bernadette being her typical overacted train-wreck and you get yet another show for the trash heap.",2015
2,"I try out shows that get a 7.5 rating or higher, and I am amazed at how many of them that get an 8 rating or above along with glowing reviews that are complete failures for me.

10,"What a good surprise! I am currently at episode 6 and I can't wait to watch the rest of the season. It makes for a nice change to hear classical music in a TV series. And even though we can't say there really is any riveting plot, the 28 minutes fly by and just make you hungry for the next episode.",2014
1,"Can we forget this ever happened? I could not stop cringing from many of the lines delivered in blank monotone. The references to drugs, sex and poor housing arrangements were simply not funny. It might have been useful to write an episode pertaining to the lack of medical insurance among session musicians and their eventual need for physical therapy due to the inherent repetitive stress injury among professional musicians. An episode including one of the characters' psychotic meltdown due to methamphetamine would have been closer to the truth, but instead all drug references were treated as cute little quips from someone who appeared to be the combination lead percussionist and drug dealer. This series is the same situation comedy dreck we've seen for decades in a new and unfortunately not very enlightening package. This series was created as a comedy but would have been more useful presenting the reality of today's professional musician as it really is.",2015
5,"Overall, I was very unimpressed with Amazon's first batch of pilots, even Transparent, which apparently turned into an excellent show. Then I saw the pilot for Mozart in the Jungle. All the intrigue, what I assumed would be a new hard ass conductor, actually intriguing characters, and some excellent music; that's what I got from the pilot. In the span of when I watched the pilot and watched the rest of the show, something must have changed, my guess being the movie Whiplash. That showed musicians being pushed to and beyond the edge of what they can handle. That was a hard ass conductor, and he knew how to push them. The Maestro in Mozart in the Jungle was very easy on them, which came across as ridiculous since it seemed the show was meant to be about musicians trying their damnedest to give it all they have. It stopped being interesting to watch very quickly, especially with the only sporadic appearances from Malcolm Macdowell. It almost felt like a labor getting through the show, even for that disappointing finish. The only part that felt watchable was when they played. That was always well done. Apart from that, the show is not worth sticking around for.",2015
6,"I have never been part of a professional orchestra, I never was good at band, and I know this show is not realistic. I'm pretty sure that someone that's good enough to be considered for the NYC Symphony is probably going to get solid offers elsewhere. They're not going to stick around and be an assistant and keep being jerked around like Hailey. I'm pretty sure that if you're good enough for the orchestra, you probably were recruited and on the radar of several groups. You're going to play for smaller symphonies until NYC comes calling again. She's old enough to know when you're being jerked around. Some people get a kick out of it, and that's what's happening to her with the Maestro.",2017
8,"This is probably the best horror movie I've seen in the past decade. It Follows is a throwback to classic late '70s - '80s horror films and draws many comparisons to John Carpenter's style, from the music to the cinematography, and rather than appearing like a carbon copy or rehash of Halloween, director David Robert Mitchell executes this odd premise with such flair and finesse that you can't help but be refreshed by its cleverness. Everything about it works, from the brooding pace to the relatable characters, effortlessly sucking you into this gloomy world where STDs can pass on entities that follow you around no matter where you are. This is where most of the suspense comes from, because instead of relying on blood and shock value, It Follows is subtle and thought provoking - you never know where this thing is and it moves so slowly that you don't know when it will appear, and this uncertainty in waiting is what real suspense is all about. ",2015
8,"Inspired by 70's and 80's horror, it follows is a refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept. The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn't completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.",2015

However, her post-coital bliss is cut short when Hugh inexplicably chloroforms her. She wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a derelict building where Hugh is rambling an apology about how he is doing this to her to show her that it's real, that it sometimes takes the form of someone you love to mess with you, and that she has to sleep with someone to pass on the curse.

It's basically a movie about passing a STD around, which apparently passing it on to someone else didn't help the problem since the original guy still saw ""It"". Filming was horrible too, most of the movie looked like someone was walking around with a video camera. I gave it 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. I'm flabbergasted at the people who gave this a good review. How anyone thought this movie even deserved 2 stars is beyond me. The only things I could come up with was either they had a part in the movie or they were on some hard drugs. An hour and 40 minutes I'll never get back.",2015

It crawled, climbed,turned and otherwise did not listen to the ""plot"", if there even is one. We don't know where it comes from, how it works, who it is or anything. This movie was a great waste of time and space. Anyone suckered into paying to see it should demand payment back and time spent.",2015
8,"Right before I saw David Robert Mitchell's ""It Follows"" at my local theater, I was greeted with previews for forthcoming supernatural horror films like ""Before I Wake,"" ""Insidious: Chapter 3,"" and the remake of ""Poltergeist,"" all of which could've probably taken clips from one another and I wouldn't have even noticed. This is how basic and thoroughly unimpressive horror has gotten over the last few years and why we need to support films like this one. Is ""It Follows"" worthy of such praise along the lines of ""the best horror film of the decade,"" ""one of the scariest films ever made,"" and so forth? Sadly, no. I sometimes think critics either speak too soon or simply want to see their name stamped before advertisements, claiming such outlandish assertions that could not only be disingenuous to their actual viewpoints but, in turn, set unrealistic expectations up for films that leave the audiences disappointed.",2015
8,"It Follows tells the story of a a sexual encounter gone bad. While this whole premise feels familiar in one way or another, director David Robert Mitchell manages to inject enough originality and genuinely disturbing images into this scary and tense horror film that is bound for cult glory. The film follows (no pun intended) Jay, an all American girl from the Detroit suburbs who dreams of meeting ""the one"" and having a summer love. As one would expect, it soon turns into a hellish nightmare that ends with a looming, potentially deadly force lurking behind every corner of her life. The film takes twists and turns throughout the way, but the best part about this film is the sense of dread in every scene. It weighs down as heavy as bricks until some truly disturbing visuals make this film go from dreadful and suspense filled to absolutely horrifying. The suspense builds and builds with this film and when it finally releases the tensions with a scare, it becomes almost unbearable to look at the screen without your hands in front of your face. The performances in this film, outside Maika Monroe, are pretty flat. This surprisingly doesn't really affect the film as bad as you would think. There's enough of a good performance coming from Monroe to carry this film to the finish line and then some. My only gripe with this film is that it is really ten minutes too long and feels as though it starts dragging in the second act. These scenes that slow it down are not necessarily bad or poorly done, it just feels as though Mitchell could have maybe left a bit more on the cutting room floor. In retrospect, this is a minimal problem. This is a horror film that is scary and truly unique. In an industry that produces crap films with cheap scares, it is very refreshing to see one that actually takes the genre seriously and delivers some serious scares. It is definitely worth watching and I highly recommend it.",2015
8,"Finally a real horror in a long time! No more bloody, slasher crap. This is how the really scary movies were made. Suspense and fear are created by great cinematography and music.",2015
4,"Over all I left disappointed and more confused than anything by the movie. Not by it's plot or by much of anything actually involving it but why I allowed myself to sit through most of it. Let me preface this review by stating this first: The movie itself is not horrible for the sake of standards, it's just not my type of movie and I will explain why.",2015
9,"If The Sixth Sense scared the sh*t out of you when going to toilet at night, or Paranormal Activity made you afraid to stay at home alone, It Follows will definitely creep you out when walking back alone at night. After I saw this film, I would definitely run my ass off if I see anyone walking slowly behind me late at night. This film is a truly modern classic with its original and brilliant concept, all of which is put together nicely with its expertly directing and thought-provoking scares. The SCARES here are effective throughout thanks largely to its excellent soundtrack and intense sound effects that even though you can tell something is coming from its increasing volume of the music, but it will still effectively shock and gives you the chill down your spines when it happens. There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you.",2015
8,"""It Follows"" (2014 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Jay and her  friends as Jay is battling ""it"". As the movie opens, in the pre-opening  credits scene we see a teenage girl running out of a house, in obvious  terror of something that seems to be following her. She drives off in a  panic and later we see her mutilated body. After the opening credits,  we get to know Jay, another teenage girl, and her group of friends.  Eventually Jay and her boyfriend have sex in his car, and that is when  stranger things start to happen. To tell you more would spoil your  viewing experience , you'll just have to see for yourself how it all  plays out.  Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from  writer-director David Robert Mitchell, and this time he gives us a  scary movie worthy of that name. This is MILES away from so-called  scary (but in reality violence-porn) movies like the Saw franchise.  Instead this movie is reminiscent of the ol' style John Carpenter  movies. In fact, it is no accident that ""It Follows"" has a strong  1970s-1980s vibe (lots of old cars from that era, no cell phone, no  internet, no cable TV, etc.). The movie is set in and around Detroit,  and the city feels like it is playing a character itself in the movie.  Check out the scene where the group of 5 kids is driving through one of  the more harrowing parts of Detroit, seemingly a post-apocalyptic area,  and later the Detroit Swimming building. Kudos to Maika Monroe in the  leading role of Jay. I saw her most recently in ""Labor Day"" but here  she brings an outstanding starring performance as vulnerable Jay. I  couldn't help but be reminded of a young Cloe Sevigny. Last but  certainly not least, there is an outstanding electronic soundtrack,  composed by Disasterpeace (the stage moniker of Rich Vreeland), which  is equally worth seeking out.  After months of internet buzz and other hype, the movie finally opened  nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it, even though as  such I am not a big fan of 'scary' movies. The early evening screening  where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which surprised me  (I had expected a lot more people in the theater). It doesn't matter.  ""It Follows"" lives up to the hype, and then some. One of the better  scary movies I have seen in a long, long time. If you have a chance to  see ""It Follows"", be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant  Video or DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. ""It Follows"" is HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED",2015
1,"This movie was pointless. The beginning has no link with the movie. you might try to co-relate it to the movie the whole time and at the end you realize how much time of yours was wasted. the movie shows kids making stupid decisions which were again very pointless, leave the viewers trying to figure out the significance behind each action of theirs. you might expect a satisfactory suspense but no the movie ends abruptly leaving you wonder why on earth did you waste your time on it. I'd suggest you to watch a porn instead, would save you your time and of course relief from unwanted drama. I love horror movies but neither this movie gave me those jump scares nor this movie had a logical plot. Such a boring piece of work.",2015
8,"Great movie. Returns the awesome score, the minimalism. Just a straight up fun horror movie from old times. If you loved Halloween, this movie is a straight up good time. It's full of style, full of dread, full of creep you the hell out. This movie is relentless. You will be on the edge of your seat the entire time. The character development is amazing and something you don't see much of in horror movies these days. It's just amazing. However, while I praise the originality and score, I have to dock some points. Why you ask? Well, the premise and metaphors are obviously anti-sex, they also tell the protagonist to have sex to pass on the curse. Also it never states how the curse first began. I can forgive that assuming it explains in a later sequel. Still awesome movie. Something that's not like the norm. You won't see much blood or guts, but it will play with your mind and you will never see people in crowds the same again. It stays with you. This movie will follow and inspire for movies to come. 10/10 for premise, score, and originality. 6/10 for explanation. Overall 10/10 movie that I give 8/10 because it doesn't give quite enough.",2015
7,"Here is an exercise in atmospheric creepiness, eerie repugnance and downright unsettlingly intensity. This Little horror film from genre newcomer David Robert Mitchell, who wrote and directed this dark and weird tale of the supernatural, conveys unexplained phenomena in a twisted display of disjointed storytelling. ""Unexplained"" is the best way of describing the action that takes place, but metaphorically this film stands alone in its attempt to recreate and pay homage to the 1980's horror films dealing with teenage sexuality and its repercussions. It seems that there is this entity, and I feel that that's the only appropriate way to define it, an ""entity"" that can take any human form it wants and mark its victims consecutively as they engage in sexual relations with each-other. It seems confusing, but quite simple in fact. This supernatural entity is somewhat of a sexually transmitted disease that is only visible to those that are marked. It has super-human strength and cunning will follow, track down and perversely destroy those that it targets without emotion, feeling or remorse.",2015

10,"'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.",2014
8,"Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.",2014
10,"This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw. It's the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their eternity"" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer. ",2014

9,"Wow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don't believe in ""perfect.""",2014
10,"I don't really cry in movies unless they're really, really sad. And this movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never cried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie would be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in it (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would play Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me away. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's how real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you do, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!",2014

These actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would have made no difference. The only impressive ""skills"" displayed came when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. ",2014

I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with. ",2015

9,"Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both have arrows strongly pointing upwards. Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both flash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and Elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very smart.",2014
1,"This film is horribly cheesy. Hollywood does cancer very very badly. The male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and therefore I did not cry. I cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all. It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female lead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found that very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch Love Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you don't really care about the characters. To be frank, the whole thing reeks of cheese. Stay away.",2014
2,"OK, so typical sappy romantic BS, but this time they have cancer? Oh give me a break. Yeah, thank god they're wealthy, attractive white people so they could have their little romantic adventure. My cousin got lymphoma at age 16 and could barely eat because of medical bills, his parents are so deep in debt they had to sell their house as no insurance would cover him. But the ""tragedy"" here is that pretentious d-bag Gus (and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor) died *after* traveling to Europe and banging a hot girl. Oh the humanity! This is a love story written for the 1%, where the biggest tragedy in life is that spoiled little daddy's money babies Gus and Hazel couldn't live to 90 off their parent's dime, probably in some Malibu beach house.",2014
10,"Without me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John Green and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which has a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote says ""Some Infinities are bigger than others"" however, Hazel and Gus's love was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with Cancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the film but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I couldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace has inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are dying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. ",2014
1,Why does this film have such a high rating? I've been tricked so many times this year by high-ratings and rave reviews to films which have turned out to me absolutely atrocious that I'm losing my faith in film critics and the cinema-going public alike.,2014
10,"I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it.",2014
1,I can not believe how high IMDb ratings are for this movie! I give 1 to this one because this film has a simple plot and can be summarized in three sentences.,2014
3,"Firstly, I must say that I am not a cold hearted person. I love a good weepy film and I was looking forward to a hungover Sunday afternoon cry but instead I was just wanting the film to end. So, what went wrong? I would say that the main reason is that Hazel is just not a likable character. Gus was just about likable but I felt nothing for Hazel, throughout the whole film she seemed cold and distant, something about her just didn't work. I'm not sure if something was lost when it went from book to screen but something happened (or didn't). At 2hrs 6 mins it was just too long..",2014
9,"Mune was a visually stunning adventure of epic scale. Set in a whimsical world, the sun and moon are controlled by their respective guardians. As the time comes for new guardians to be selected, the boasting and brawny Sohone is selected as the new guardian of the sun. In an odd twist of fate, the reluctant Mune is selected as new guardian of the moon. This film features a very beautiful world, filled with all kind of creatures and fauna. Both the day-dwelling and night- dwelling creatures are very distinct, building a very rich, interesting world. The story is very easy to follow and features a huge cast of distinct, interesting characters. We see practically every corner of this vast world, from the bright, stony land of the day-dwellers to the luscious forests the night-dwelling creatures live in. It's very clear that a colossal amount of creativity was put into this film, and it offers a fantastic visual experience. What definitely surprised me most about this film is that it features several scenes rendered in 2D animation. It is a style you see very little of in mainstream animated films, and was a nice change indeed. This is a great movie for animation buffs like me, and those who love whimsical adventures as much as their children.",2015
8,"7.75 of 10. Stylistically and in terms of the quality of animation and imagery, one of the best recent cartoon films. The story is pure fantasy and works as sort of new a fairy tale clearly for children but with various themes that make it enjoyable for everyone in a family and certainly safe enough for kids to enjoy alone.",2016

8,"France is only next to the Hollywood when it comes to the 3D animation. Not sufficient films were made in this format, but still the quality and creativity are laudable. When I saw one of this film's poster, not just for me, but anybody would think of the Na'vi from 'Avatar'. That's a misconception, only until you watch this film.

Oh please, this movie oozes fantasy reminicent of The Dark Crystal and Never Ending Story but more suitable for even the very young.",2018
9,"This movie is straight up eye candy, right up there with Disney & Pixar productions. I watched Mune with my 4 year old and was instantly drawn to the beautiful animations. There were major Salvador Dali & Hayao Miyazaki influences in this dream world. I really can't praise the animators enough for the beauty they created in this film The story was lovely, despite some of the characters falling into cliche stereotypes (looking at you Sohone)",2018

3,"A standard collection of cliché characters (featuring Smart Girl, Awkward Boy, Arrogant Man, Sneaky Man and fearful, judgmental parents) are immersed in a kooky fairy tale world and given kooky fairy bodies. The computer graphics are passable but extra colorful, and the storyline is cobbled together from a random series of errors, without meaning or pathos. It's creepy enough to frighten sensitive children, it's freaky enough to disorient guileless children, and irrational enough to unbalance sensible children. The dreary jumble of scatterbrained and foolish scenes are not worth the effort it would take to stitch this puerile mass into a workable mythology. This movie demonstrate that dressing up a boilerplate teen movie with bizarre CGI cannot save it. This is why Pixar movies are so beloved; they drench their movies with plot. The creators of Mune, so intent on blowing the minds of kids with today's state-of-the-art CGI, skimped on plot. Thus, we are left with another forgettable art project, and as the state-of-the-art CGI advances there will be nothing of value left at all.",2018

The writing is certainly witty and stylized but not so much as to obscure the human core of the characters, the content poking gleeful fun at the foolishness its characters engage in in the service of sex and relationships. It's edginess relies more on wit than raunch, which is a refreshing change, and the treatment of its characters surprisingly heartfelt. Time will tell if it has legs but one episode in and Scrotal Recall is one of the most promising British comedies of recent years.""",2014

After the first episode I was also on the fence, but having watched the first 5 episodes I understand and appreciate the direction this show is going. The characters are developed, the plot is relatable and funny, and the style of the show (ie, flashbacks to partners) is very well done. I would challenge viewers to watch more than just the first episode in order to truly appreciate this one. It's by no means on par with Arrested Development, but that is hard to accomplish with a comedy. However, I do think it is much better written and acted than most of the 'comedies' on network TV - in that the acting and humor feel raw and real.",2015

I didn't even realize I was on the last chapter until it ended and there were no more chapters left. I literally started crying when I saw thee were no more chapters so I had to go on Wikipedia to find out if there was a second season on the making (there is). Seriously, this just takes a few hours to finish and it is really worth it. Much more than just a romantic comedy. Btw, I literally just made this IMDb account so I could write this review. I've recommended this to many of my friends and I searched for the reviews on here to see if anyone felt the same way and I just thought to myself, I really need to let others know how good this TV show was. I hope I could tell the writer and actors and directors how good their work is. I can't wait for the second season!",2016

I hope they decide to continue with a second season.",2015

There's everything here from riposte to slapstick and a lots of in between. We very much wish there were more episodes, although the last of the six did seem okay. It's a whole entity -- and it could grow. Hope to see these actors in other things as well.",2015

""Scrotal Recall"" is not afraid to have broad humour tangled in with charm, mischief and guffaws while it examines relationships and affairs of the heart.

Episode 1 is set at the wedding of meek Angus and bride from hell, Helen. Helen is great fun to watch. Helen the bride barks orders at her entourage.

Each episode is roughly 30 minutes long, nothing serious and its not the sort of comedy that makes you roll on the floor but it will definitely make you feel better.

I Love the dynamic between the 3 lead actors. Even though this has only 6 episodes there is plenty of room for character development and space for back stories and secrets to be revealed which adds a richness to the basic outlining storyline of a man getting in touch with old girlfriends and lovers and that is quite rare in a sitcom formula. Especially with the seemingly 2 dimensional character of Danny Ings which they explore wonderfully in one episode. glad that Netflix is giving it another series.",2016

This isn't going to win any awards but if you want some laughs then watch it. The cast is great and very likable. While the lead character isn't the best looking man on earth he definitely wins you over the more you watch him. The story, as you can read above, is about a guy that finds out he had an STD and has to start telling all of his exes. Each episode goes in to a story of a different ex/hook up while showing the present and how certain things have effected it. The lead girl is wonderful and definitely my favorite part about the show. Acting is great and while some may be over the top it's perfect for the show.",2015

10,"I never write a review before, I decided to write it because I really love it and I recommend it to everybody. When I first watched it, I didn't expect much. Everything in the show are natural. The conversation is interesting and funny. The actor and actress's acting are natural. They are like acting themselves, it didn't feel odd. (Sometime when I watch other shows, somehow I felt embarrassed for the other actor/actress because I can see they are ""acting"", it's too fake.) ",2016
9,"Seems like the original title (""Scrotal Recall""!) was a little too on-the-nose for Netflix, even though it's a perfect fit for the show's initial premise: Dylan, a young Glaswegian, loves not wisely but too much, gets chlamydia, is obliged (by law) to notify all his exes, going back a couple of years Not sure that makes total sense from an epidemiological standpoint; it's really just a pretext for some entertaining flashbacks, one episode per ex, like Rob's obsession with reliving his failed relationships in ""High Fidelity.""

3,"I would have to agree with the two other negative reviews. Yes, I too only watched the first episode, but to be honest don't really feel a drive to watch any other episodes - doesn't this on it's own mean it was bad? I don't need to have to devote more time to a show that I just don't see would deliver. The idea was great and I even laughed at the first couple of lines which were puns (silly I know). But as the episode progresses I found the main character too goofy and some of the others too stereotypical also to be believable at all. I know shows don't have to be believable but I like them so, especially if they don't particularly gain something from being over the top (think Danger 5 or It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia).",2015
10,"I have been coming to IMDb for many years now, as I always can rely on the average grade of a movie or show. But until now I never felt the urge to write or grade anything. So today I signed up, because this show deserves a higher rating than an 8.1. There are no flaws (in my opinion). I love the characters and their story lines. It's very funny at times, but it can be heartbreaking as well. Every episode leaves me wanting more. Usually I don't even try shows with an average rating on IMDb below 8.5, but I'm glad I took a chance on this one. Try it, you won't regret it!",2017
9,"Being drunk and having read some words about being banned from writing future reviews in case I give away any spoilers, makes me fairly petrified. But here goes it...this is the right kind of mush. The story, the characters are so well written, that you crave for more (nice word crave), you want to hear more, see more from each of the characters- Evie in Season 1 and surprisingly Angus in Season 2. Every episode is a little sloppy mushy romantic little present waiting to be opened. You can't help but root for Dillon in every episode (I think I am going to check ""Contains Spoilers"" at this point). If this the kind of Romcoms I can look forward to without the age old sexism and sappy formulas(Is it formulae?) , I am all in. The backdrop of Glasgow is beautiful. The only one reason why I held myself from giving this a 10 is because, the complex characters have been portrayed really young and my mind of 33 years (ok 34) cannot comprehend me having such emotions at such a young age.",2016

The premise was so basic, Dylan has to inform his previous lovers that he has an STD. Because of great writing, Dylan's adventures turn into a closer look at his relationships and those of his flatmates, Luke, Evie and their friend, Angus. And, the relationships are realistic, messy, and complicated. But, throughout it all you want them all to find happiness. Worth catching for its optimism that everyone will find their way in love eventually.",2018
10,"The second season(or series for my friends in the UK)was just released on Netflix. I binged watched it this past Monday. I'm hoping the title change will give this wonderful show more exposure! When I first watched the first season I thought the title was a bit off-putting for US audiences(such prudes). This is a funny yet feeling ensemble cast comedy. The way the main and supporting characters are brilliantly written and played really makes you care for them and feel a part of their group. No one mixes comedy and drama better than the British/Irish/Scottish. The show really took me back to my 20's when I was searching for ""The One"" like Dylan is. Eagerly awaiting Season 3!!!",2016
6,"At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, ""He'll be killed,"" ""She'll be kidnapped and used as bait,"" ""Something bad's gonna happen to him,"" and my all-time favorite, ""He's the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we'll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown."" And every prediction is spot-on.",2014
7,"Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.",2014
10,"The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washington's Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained, but with ever-building intensity, Washington turns in another stellar performance. ",2014
10,"Some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical, run-of-the-mill, action movie, nothing you haven't seen before....nothing could be farther from the truth!! ",2014
8,"In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. ",2015
8,"Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.",2014
2,"Sorry Denzel, not even your amazing talent could save this laughably insultingly lame, simple-minded, patronizing movie straight from the mind of a toddler trapped in a 38 year old Hollywood screenwriter fantasizing about saving abused hookers from fat Russian mobsters. But 2 good things about this movie: 1) Denzel AND 2) Mustache twirling, bootleg Kenneth Branagh main villain.",2014
7,Going in to the Equalizer I was expecting an updated Man on Fire and even though it is not in the same league it was still pretty damn good. Denzel Washington plays the role of quite avenger to perfection. He is one of the few actors I believe can really do this and I would pay to watch him do it.,2015
10,The movie was action packed and I love when the good guy always win. The character don't talk much but you can only pull that off if you are a good actor. The young actress I hear she is 17 did an amazing job to play that part.Denzel no words you still got the box office power. My husband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one scene came up he gets a kick out of that stuff. Never seen the Equalizer series at all so my opinion is from the movie only. Sequel is wide open lets have more next year. Hope to see more. Love It. Hope the DVD be out for a Christmas Present for the husband I will be buying it. All I can say is go see this movie because it is very good don't listen to the haters.,2014
6,"Fairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most sensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours, the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes, but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that said, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't want to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10",2014
8,"Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.",2014
6,"The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.",2014
3,"In 2003 while Denzel Washington was promoting his dumb but fun thriller Out of Time he gave an interview stating how it was nice to star in a film that didn't require him to do too much. Coming off the back of his 2002 Oscar win for Training Day, Washington didn't exactly sugar coat the idea that Out of Time was a pay check gig pure and simple. Since then Denzel's film choices have seemed littered with these quick cash movies. For every Man on Fire or Inside Man we get a Safe House or last year's forgettable 2 Guns. The Equalizer sees Washington re-team for the first time since 2002 with Training day Director Antoine Fuqua. Audience's hoping to see a return to form from the Training day duo maybe disappointed. The Equalizer feels like another pay check gig, it certainly is dumb it lacks any of the fun of Out of Time...And that movie stared Dean Cain.",2014
1,"Huge disappointment. Enter the Cold war II!A single 60-years old guy destroys the most severe Russian gang in a local DIY with screws and hammers. The first 10 minutes were OK, but after that it turned into a cheap action without any logical plot. The final was crushing - Denzel goes to Moscow and kills the bad guy in his bathroom, preliminary liquidating his army of bodyguards. The message - Russians, don't mess with us or we shall send you our deadliest weapon - DIY supervisor. We have a new sheriff in town - killing the bad, protecting the poor Latin minority, punishing the corrupted cops... Hollywood best days were over long time ago. RIP! I haven't watched such ridiculous propaganda since Rambo. 2 hours wasted time and bad taste in the mouth.",2014
3,"I actually smelled the odor of a piece of ""riiiiiight"" cinema pretty early on, and decided to stop watching. A ""riiiight"" film, for those who don't know because I just made it up, is where the filmmaker tries to make you believe something so unrealistic and far fetched that you say to yourself (or maybe even say out loud): ""riiiiiight, possibly followed by ""suuuuuuuuuuure"".",2015
3,The movie is a series of clichés. Denzel saves it from being 0 stars.,2017
1,"Alright, so I was dragged to IMAX and had to pay 17 pounds to watch over two hours of headache-inducing visual/sound effects, ridiculously unrealistic characters, logical inconsistencies and a shameless glorification of gore & violence. If you want to use far fetched gore scenes then at least have a plot that can back them upSo its a 7.8/10 huh? Anyone praising this film is either under 15 years old or completely out of his mind. Wont be watching any Denzel Washington flicks anytime soon, shame on a so-called ""established"" actor for taking part in such an atrocity. I would give it a zero out 10, seems that IMDb doesn't have such an option tho.",2014
2,"If it was not a Denzel Washington movie; it could easily pass for ""B"" direct to video movie. Low production values; not outstanding characters or actors (aside from Denzel and little used Cloe Moretz), a quite predictable and lazy written story, several ""USA POLITICALLY CORRECT DETAILS"" **spoiler follow** Denzel never kills a cop **end of spoiler** This is a movie Denzel can do it while sleeps and he is really good; but it is not a good movie by far. Too long for his own good and cheap special effects, uninteresting final showdown. Antoine Fuqua made the mid budget ""Olympus Has Fallen"" last year and the looked far more expensive that this one (which reportedly cost over 50M) In brief; if you are a fan of Denzel; get ""Training Day""; this one is not worth the over two hours spent.",2014

10,We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.,2014
9,"""There should be no boundary between human endeavour,"" Stephen Hawking explains during a press conference. It is this line that strikes a chord at the very centre of James Marsh's incredible biopic on one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. The Theory of Everything is not just a story about the science behind the beginnings of our universe, but the science of love; and how life's challenges that we face everyday, shape who we are and what we achieve. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones turn in phenomenal performances as the revolutionary Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane Wilde. Eddie's mentally and physically challenging role, displaying Hawkings brilliance and motor neuron disease, are extremely commendable and impressive (a sure fire for a Best Actor nomination at next year's Oscars). On the more sensitive side, Felecity displays the endless love and powerful fight Jane brought to the Hawking household. As the years pass, their lives are changed tremendously in very profound and heart-wrenching ways. The movie does not shy away from making Hawking a complex character, as well as Jane, showing both their positive and negative sides. I really liked that the movie was able to shape them into fully well-rounded characters despite the ""romance"" aspect of it. The score for the film is tremendous.. absolutely outstanding! It hits all the right marks, brings upon emotions right when you are on the verge of tears, leaves you in awe after a beautiful monologue, and finishes with a melancholy but very fitting tone. The script and directing were top-notch.. right up there with the best... and the cinematography? give that guy an award already! A masterpiece to watch. While some critics may be quick to judge how the film focuses more on the romance rather than the science that made Hawking so renowned, I believe that the love is what made him who he is today. Human endeavour is endless... Stephen never gave up hope, nor did Jane... and though their lives ended up in different places, it was their years together that displayed to us how a little bit of hope can go a very, very long way.",2014
10,"What a wonderful accomplishment of a film by James Marsh (Man on Wire) who brings such depth and beauty to the life/love story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. The film is adapted from her novel on their life and brings forth much of the love and tenacity necessary to care for and love someone going through great physical struggles over time. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones give fantastic and intimate portrayals of Stephen and Jane during their courtship and lives together. My vote for best film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. In Q&A after film James Marsh told a great story about Stephen Hawking's reaction to the film where he gave the response that it was in ""largely genuine""... and Eddie Redmayne said that Stephen Hawking after viewing the film allowed them to use his actual ""voice"" instead of their approximation for the film that they had produced. The most touching was that Hawking had tears to be wiped away after viewing which will give to you a sense of how genuine this film is.",2014
7,"The Theory of Everything tells the uphill struggle that world renowned genius Stephen Hawking went through when dealing with his, now, infamous disease and trying to maintain his relationship with his loving wife, Jane. The strengths of this film rely solely on Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. These two actors are absolutely, one hundred percent, PHENOMENAL in these two roles. Stephen Hawking is the role that Redmayne was born to play. Hawking is portrayed as a charming and intellectually superior individual that behaves just like any one else. After a bit, we start to wonder what was every so amazing about him...then the heartbreak starts. Jane Hawking is a sweet, loving and determined person that will go to the lengths of the universe to make sure her husband, Stephen can survive. I get chills just thinking about certain scenes, some of which will most definitely be requiring a large box of Kleenex. The truth is, anything that I say here about these performances, no matter what it is, is still criminally underselling the sheer brilliance of them. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are simply incredible and I'd be even willing to go to the extreme to say that both actors will not only be nominated, but I'd be surprised if they didn't win the Oscar gold. Now, with that being said, this film's structural issues are severely hampering this film's chances at being a classic. I wasn't completely sold on the structural integrity of the film. It showed enough of the relationship aspect behind Stephen and Jane but it very briefly touched base on Hawking's intellectual discoveries and I thought that if it was a bit more balanced in that respect, it would be a near perfect film. One plot point that I did find utterly enthralling is the idea that Hawking struggles throughout the film to do simple things. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. James Marsh directs his actors effortlessly and can evoke the type of emotional response out of his audience through them, but when left with telling a story, Marsh falters. Marsh, known for 2012 IRA drama, Shadow Dancer proves that he is an actor's director. He cares about human drama over anything in a tangible sense, which benefits this film greatly but also harms it in the way of progression. Despite these minor infractions, The Theory of Everything is a film that everyone can enjoy and turns into a real audience movie. It is a film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next, no easy feat for any film, and this one does it effortlessly.",2014
7,"Encompassing all the best parts of films like A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard but creating its own signature and style to the biopic genre, James Marsh's gorgeous and beautifully compelling The Theory of Everything, the true story of Stephen and Jane Hawking, is a sensitive piece of filmmaking that stands as one of the finest movie efforts of the year. Starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane, the two develop a masterful and sonorous dynamic that behaves as a naturalistic relationship that inhabits qualities of both love and sadness. They're a match made in heaven. Also acting as a morality tale, screenwriter Anthony McCarten puts forth intriguing questions regarding love in the shadow of someone's disability. Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?",2014
9,This film is highly recommended.,2014
10,"Before going into and seeing, The Theory of Everything, I really did not know too much about Stephen Hawking. I of course knew who he was and that he was a famous physicist for his work on black holes and other such matters and I had also seen video clips and photos of him, but really knew otherwise next to nothing about him and I have never actually read any of his books, but after seeing the film I am a little tempted and curious to do so, even if the subject matter does go over my head a bit (I both did poorly and did not enjoy high school physics class). On the other hand, those who go into The Theory of Everything, looking for an elaborate account of Hawking's work and his science and the method behind his work, then those people may be in for a bit of a letdown as this story while it does focus on Hawking's life, it mostly focuses on his long marriage and relationship with his wife, Jane, who wrote the book on which the film is based on. The film focuses heavily on the relationship between Stephen and his wife, Jane and the hardships they had to deal with due to his various health problems that he developed when they first become interested in each other till the present time. Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, does a phenomenal job here. He starts out as a shy, somewhat bookish and nerdy student who has a fair bit of humour to him and also has a love of education and finding out the big questions and answers of the world. As his illness develops and progresses over the years, we see how hard it is for him to move, speak and just do everyday things whereas he is eventually confined to a wheelchair and has to speak through a computer. Redmayne's performance is so believable and must have been really hard to pull off as we see him struggle to eat, walk, speak and just how he twists his face and muscles and how much physical difficulty and pain is involved in this as well as his strong desire to succeed and to achieve more and more each day is evident in Redmayne's wonderful performance which must have been exhausting and difficult to play, but he does an excellent job here in what I think is one of the year's best performances. Equally good here is Felicity Jones, who plays Jane. While the role is not as demanding physically, it is more demanding emotionally as we see her totally devote herself to all of Stephen's every waking needs and how she went out of her way to both care and love for him. At times it was certainly difficult and I am sure she just wanted to give up, but we also as in him, see her determination to make things work and she is an incredibly strong person and character and you can see that everything she does has her full best and wonderful intentions. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. When the film first started out, I thought it would be a fairly safe and by the numbers biopic, but it really took me by surprise at how interesting I found these characters, their lives and the situations they found themselves in. Again because of the brilliant performances and masterful script and direction we can both care for and have empathy for these characters as well as personally cheer them on and wish all the best for them as we are sitting quietly in our theatre screens glued to the screen with captivation and interest. The film has an excellent pace to it and works well as a biographical film, but works even better as a story of love and the difficulties and sacrifices it took to make it work and just how strong both Stephen and his wife are at the end of this film after all they have gone through. It really is an inspirational and feel good film when you think about it after all they accomplished and went through. Sure there are moments of heartache and when we see them suffer, but it is not all grim. We also see moments of happiness and how these two, from the second they met, really do love each other and had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. The film is doing well in limited release and expanded wider in theatres this week and I feel very privileged to have been able to see it on the big screen. It is thoroughly fascinating from start to finish and features two of this year's most believable and best performances and also gives us hope and encouragement while we may be not exactly in their same circumstances, but for other things as well. The Theory of Everything, is a real triumph and one of the best films of 2014.",2014
5,"The curse of most biopics about famous individuals is that the films in question always boil down a subjects life to a ""greatest hits"" reel and then stuffs the rest of the run time with a sub-narrative to tie all these moments together. More often than not, this sub-narrative is a love story, which isn't inherently bad; it's just that when a proper balance isn't struck between the major themes and the filler, the results are usually lackluster. ""The Theory Of Everything"" charts the tumultuous marriage of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane as they struggle to keep their life together while Stephen slowly succumbs to the symptoms of ALS. And while it puts all of its efforts into trying to be a heartbreaking portrait of a strained marriage (a portrait that at times is quite beautiful), the movie seemingly forgets that one of its subjects also happened to be one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century.",2014
8,But it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal struggle with his illness that's very uplifting.,2014
7,"This is 2014's most overrated film of the year. While Eddie Redmayne is good as Stephen Hawking, it's really just a performance that deceives the viewer and critic. He looks like Hawking. His hair and clothes look like Hawking. He does the 'Hawking' smile and weird thinking stare face and frowns. Yes, he does a believable Hawking. Well done. But it's just a glorified impersonation. There's no actual great acting or stretch of a transformation or method or scenes that Redmayne is tested as an actor nor Hawking's character development. The dialogue and interactions, aside from using actual Hawking quotes from speeches and writings, are awful and boring and redundant and derivative. The whole performance is mild and plain, and the story is weak. The story has generally been done before. There are no significant scenes or moments that go above and beyond anything generic, nor anything for Redmayne to truly bite into to 'perform.' Even the accident and fall portion of the film is mild and never really becomes that emotional at all. Mostly, the film fails miserably in exploring Hawking's internal thoughts, imagination, rituals, and inspirations.",2014
8,"I've read scientists are turned off by this film for its omissions, simplifications, falsities, and other failures to explain Prof. Hawking's theories. I can understand that, being a law specialist who can't watch law dramas. But if you're not a cosmologist or a physicist you should not be discouraged by the film's failure to give you enough detail for a two credit course. It's a good drama of people, a bit schmaltzy as befits the facts, and in that regard I understand it's pretty accurate, and is definitely well acted and directed. Also a nice glimpse of what Oxbridge life was like in the 1950s. As they say, the male lead is Oscar bait.",2014
1,"This type of movie must be factually correct above everything else. Instead it is a hodgepodge of 50% theatrics, 49% personal life drama and 1% science and even that of questionable accuracy. ",2014
6,"A biopic of Stephen Hawking, mostly focused on his relationship with his first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles, which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character. Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much (though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent but not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before with the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register. My favorite thing besides the lead performances was the very pleasant score, by Johan Johansson. Probably worth seeing on video, but don't go out of your way.",2014
1,"Our subject, Stephen Hawking, was on the verge of discovering THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but the director obviously didn't realize before a montage sequence shows two people getting married, and then their babies growing into toddlers before our very eyes, we should know the characters just a bit.",2014
4,I was hugely disappointed by this film after all the hype.,2015
1,"This movie completely misses the mark. The world is interested in Stephen Hawking for his scientific contributions to the world. The fact he has a horrible illness is incidental. This movie drags the viewer through the weeds of Hawking's pain and suffering and never let's up until the final minutes of the movie. It was exhausting to watch and leaves the viewer with no real answers to the questions they came to better understand, explore and enjoy. ",2014
2,"It was sad to see a film take such a wonderful subject as the life and ambitions of Mr. Hawkins and attempt,dismally, to create it for nothing more than a contender in the awards 'game'. This is the kind of tripe which is accepted all too readily as biopic material and offers little or nothing of the person or their skills other than to show off as a proffered mating ritual. Mr. Redmaynes painstaking efforts are the only reason I gave it any rating at all. With all the facts and wonder we have have at our disposal about the man, why is it that there is little or nothing involving his deep, driving demand for 'the answer' and all that is entailed in his studies. Rather we are given still another sexist portrayal of two people battling impossible odds to finally give in to their bases needs, with others. Not only old fare but out of place and cheapening to the real story line. I could only try to dissuade others from subjecting themselves to this demeaning film.",2014
9,The Theory of Everything is an extremely moving love story concerning the brilliant British scientist Stephen Hawking and his first marriage. Whilst you may need a PhD in Physics to understand the intricacies of Hawking's theories (which by coincidence I have and – no – it's not enough) the lack of any sort of Physics knowledge is not a barrier to enjoying this movie.,2015
5,"Here are my reasons, in summary: ",2015
5,"Yes, Stephen Hawking's life story is quite remarkable, and his contributions to cosmology and physics are of some significance. This movie, however, in a word, is sloppy.",2015
3,"I am a die-hard admirer of Mr. Hawking's life and work. And while, when our present becomes history, he won't be counted among Newton, Einstein or likes of them, he is still a living symbol, one of the greatest contemporary minds. Speaking of it, do you know exactly what his greatest scientific discoveries are? A movie will try to give you an even sloppier explanation then what Interstellar did of something else. Ultimately, it is not important, as he himself disproved his greatest discovery. His true lifetime achievement lies instead in popularization of science. Making the unimaginable (borderline) understandable. And that is where he will live forever as an inspiration beside people like Feynman, Samuelson or Sagan.",2015
2,I found this movie to be very thin.This is a quite boring and traditionally made biopic of Steven Hawking.I was hoping it would be showing us more of an insight into the brilliant mind of Steven.It does not.It's subject is more or less: how to cope & go on living with a very disabled person as a spouse.I'v understood that the base of the film was the book by Jane hawking Stevens wife.Although one might say that the main character gives us good acting....it brings us nothing.IMO.it's just a sentimental 13 in a dozen biopic and never original. a missed opportunity!It would be far more interesting if we got more offered why Steven Hawking is such an immensely important scientist.,2015
2,A ten star reviewer actually said: ...these two....had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. ,2015
3,"The Theory of Everything is a misleading title. However, that's not the most misleading thing about this film. The cinematography and score give the impression you are about to watch a heart-felt, inspirational tale where love conquers all.

10,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a mockumentary about four vampires sharing a flat together. ",2014
10,"When you very nearly spray a mouthful of drink over the person in front of you, its generally a good indicator the movie is pretty funny. The sandwich joke had me in stitches! This movie doesn't rely on just a few jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. The cast in this movie are well picked, and Stu was brilliantly played by...well Stu. Taiki Waititi & Jemaine Clement really get the whole dilemma of everyday life as a vampire! Hopefully this gets picked up and the masses get a chance to enjoy this wee gem. Loved this movie and would definitely recommend it. Gave this a 10. A must see!!",2014
9,"I watched this movie, knowing nothing about it before, and it completely blew me away. It had me gut-busting from the very first scene throughout the entire movie. The premise of vampire flatmates is absurd, but it works great, because the movie takes its characters just serious enough for the audience to be somewhat emotionally invested in them. The chemistry between the actors is also great. But of course, the biggest strength of the movie is, that it delivers laughs on a very consistent level. Seriously, there was probably a joke every minute, that made me laugh so hard, I cried. I really don't wanna oversell this one, but I think this might be the funniest mockumentary since ""This is Spinal Tap"". If you like mockumentaries, dark comedy, vampires, or are just generally into humor, definitely go see this one. This is the funniest movie of the year so far, but I'm sure, that won't change.",2014
9,"The comedy horror is so hard to get right. Then using the Vampire genre and the equally overused mockumentary style you are pushing a boulder up hill. So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson's Brain Dead is perhaps the pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it heels. Gags and gore in equal abundance with a beating heart at its center, entrails to the left. Check it out!",2014
9,"I wasn't sure about this one, I cannot remember anything about Flight of the Concords (sp?) and comedy is a sticky thing for me. I find that I laugh out loud more often during dramas, horror, thrillers etc than comedies. I thought GRAND BUDAPEST, ZERO THEOREM and THE DOUBLE were hilarious. But this surprised me... a lot.",2014
9,"This fly-on-the-wall mockumentary is a refreshingly silly take on a genre that desperately needed sending up - vampires. If you thought vampire movies had reached saturation point, think again, because What We Do In The Shadows manages to lend it a thankfully comical bent. Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement lead a solid cast of Kiwi actors playing a small group of inept but lovable bloodsuckers living in a flat together in Wellington. When a freshly turned convert starts bragging about his newfound vampire status while out clubbing, things start going wrong for the troupe, who until then had only to contend with minor problems like what to wear on a night out when your wardrobe is 400 years out of fashion, and how to go clubbing when nobody will invite you in the door. Vampire gags come thick and fast and there's enough of a solid plot to keep the movie entertaining. It even gets a little bit tense in places when the flatmates start to fall out over the new convert's bad behaviour. All in this is a very funny film, with more than a few classic one-liners. A great date movie to check whether your lover-to-be can handle a little dark humour. Highly recommended.",2014
10,I laughed and laughed and laughed.,2014
9,"The three lead vampires in this film were absolutely fantastic, especially Jonathon Brugh (His solo dance routine was one of the most awkwardly hilarious things I have ever seen!).

10,"Let me start with: I don't like ""reality TV"" at all. And there is a reason you have to put """", because it is anything but real. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.",2014
8,"Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement seem to understand misfits. Waititi explored them in his first two films, Eagle vs Shark and Boy, and Clement's partnership with Bret McKenzie as Flight of the Conchords was an object lesson in not fitting in. Their early works were loved both here and abroad. Between them, Waititi and Clement have been nominated at the Grammys, the Emmys and the Oscars, hardly a pedigree to be sniffed at. I guess the domestic appeal of this is born of New Zealand being a strange little country down the bottom of the world, whose national bird doesn't fly, who dared stand up to the Americans and say ""No Nukes"", and which has been the backdrop for some of the hugest blockbusters of recent years. We're proud of our strangeness. The international appeal is perhaps due in part to the same thing, our unique individuality. I guess, coming from a pair of inveterate misfits, What We Do in the Shadows, an exploration of vampires who live among humans, but are intrinsically not living humans themselves, is a natural growth of themes already explored. As this film explores vampire tropes with fresh eyes, it gives, as well, a poignant look at the value of exploring past beliefs, hurts, losses and prejudices anew and seeing what can grow. As each of us age, it becomes easier to get stuck in our ways, how much more so for vampires whose age is counted not in decades but centuries. For Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr there are many challenges. Viago faces the classic immortal's dilemma; his beloved growing old without him. Vladislav has a beast from the past which could rear its head again. Deacon faces the challenge of meeting a new generation and realising his own youth is slipping away. Petyr is growing ever more ancient, and is working to create a legacy. From these challenges come a fresh look at relationships between old enemies, at the cost of indiscretion, at unfulfilled promises and at the need to sometimes sacrifice your own desires out of genuine affection for another. This is a quirky film, slightly disjointed in places. But it delights in its lo-fi quirk right from the very 1970's looking ""New Zealand Documentary Board"" credit at the beginning. There's plenty of laughs to be had. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, it might be hard for some to follow, but there's entertainment to be found here for all. And now to the reviewer's bias. My grandmother, with whom I attended the Wellington première. Ethel Robinson assured me leading up to the movie that hers would be a very small part. It was, but it was a very necessary component part. And she filled it admirably, as did each of the performers in this piece. From the puzzled police, the frustrated familiar, the affable alpha-wolf, all the way to the venerable vampires themselves, no-one seemed out of place in this gentle comedy. Though it is about the undead, you can feel the warm heart beating below the surface of What we do in the Shadows, a film which will leave you thinking about vampires, and maybe about the world too, in a new way.",2014
9,"I'm in the twilights of my years and no longer part of ""Generation Twilight"", so initially I wasn't so hot on a vampire mockumentary. The idea seemed good enough for maybe 30 minutes of comedy, and not for a full feature movie. But What We Do In The Shadows is brilliantly done and really buckets of fun. It rides on the great actors, but also on a wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly ""porno camera"" and perfectly placed special effects. The movie addresses various aspects of being a vampire in New Zealand today:",2014
10,"It took a while for me to get my bearings on this film—very deadpan (in keeping with the mock-umentary format) and very gory, which is an odd combo—but once I stopped expecting one long episode of Flight of the Conchords (although it definitely is reminiscent, and has some great cross-over), it killed me. Definitely a movie that gets funnier and funnier the more times you watch it. Just brilliant and witty and sweet and silly. But, you know, with vampires. With New Zealand accents. Another plus, this movie is short—about an hour and a half, I think. With the norm moving towards 3+ hours, it was a delight to not spend the entire evening in the theater. Again, there are some really bloody bits, so I might not suggest it as a first-date movie, depending on the date, but it's one of my favorite films from this year.",2014
9,"no-one does dry, self-deprecating ironic humour like the kiwis. Its a unique blend of taking oneself too seriously, trying to be cool in very awkward, self-conscious way (because its not cool to try to be cool)resulting in apparently accidental absurdity known as ""being a dick"". A vampire mockumentary is a brilliant vehicle for this kind of humour, as vampires are supposed to have an undead, hypnotic kind of glamour which can easily be camped up without seeming to do so deliberately. The scenes where the vamps are trying to decide what to wear for a night on the town without being able to see their own reflection is a perfect example of this. This comic ethos also explains why mortal Stu is so popular with the vamps...he's very cool because he's not trying to be cool at all to the point of having no personality. Ironically he's a total nerd.",2015

7,"What We Do in the Shadows is a low-budget, horror comedy about a small group of vampires that live in an apartment together in modern day New Zealand. The plot focuses on how these vampires adapt to a new vampire joining their group. The four initial vampires consist of Deacon, Petyr, Viago and Vladislav. Each of these vampires come from drastically different backgrounds and range from a couple hundred to a several thousand years old. This variety in backgrounds allows the characters to be very unique and it makes their interactions funny and interesting. This movie has one goal and one goal, only: the make you laugh. The plot is not very deep and can sometimes lack flow, but the jokes are consistently funny so you really don't care. The film is shot like a documentary. Characters will occasionally talk to the camera similar to Modern family or the Office. The quick cuts and explanatory dialogue allows fantastic comedic timing. The special effects are low budget but are most of the time done very well. Some of the camera tricks are very impressive and make the scenes feel quite real. The flying effects are quite poor, though. It is obvious that the actors are just suspended by wires. This might seem like a negative, but the way it is portrayed on screen makes it quite hilarious. There are a couple of brief action scenes which are done well enough. The chases can get quite shaky, though. This is a rated R film, but the graphic material was handled very well. There are a few f-words, but they are rare enough and used to appropriate places most of the time. The blood is so over-the-top and silly that it didn't bother me at all. If there is anything that would be extremely graphic, it is blurred out. I wasn't expecting much when entering the theater, but I left thoroughly entertained. If you want to laugh and if don't care that the plot is somewhat irrelevant then you will have a blast.",2015

In fact the whole formula seemed a little superimposed, it adds up to ""here are three guys that live together AND they are vampires"". Many jokes are taken from roommate/college-night-out situations and translated to vampires, with only a handful of laughing out loud moments in the entire movie. However, after a clumsy start, it became progressively interesting to see how they handled and presented certain occult myths - sadly we never get far beyond pop culture occultism. ",2015

8,"There's plenty to be cynical about where Paddington is concerned. The first feature film about the iconic bear - red hat, blue coat, suitcase in hand - was first announced in 2007, and went through a gestation period that's extraordinarily long even for a heavily animated film. The trailer's (literal) toilet humour seemed to confirm that it was pitched firmly at kids. And last, but certainly not least, the cast experienced a shake-up of fairly seismic proportions when Colin Firth announced in July that - with the unanimous consent of all concerned - he would no longer be voicing Paddington. All signs pointed towards a disaster of a movie, one stitched together to cash in on rather than celebrate the phenomenon of Paddington, a little bear who has lived in books, TV series and cuddly merchandise around the world.",2014

9,"9 December 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Paddingon. I've been looking forward to this film for months and it didn't disappoint. Just in case there is the remotest chance that nobody knows......Paddington is the tale of a bear from deepest darkest Peru who comes to London and takes up residence with the Brown Family. There are all the recognisable elements from the children's programme, from the blue duffel coat down to the marmalade sandwich kept in Paddington's hat for emergencies. The baddie was played exquisitely by Nicole Kidman, a job she seems to relish. Mr Brown was excellently played by Hugh Bonneville, who seemed to carry a tiny but welcome piece of Lord Grantham into the character. The addition of Julie Walters as Mrs Bird was inspiring as she manages to bring her usual brilliance to the old housekeeper who had been with the family for years. The animation was extraordinary and had the whole audience laughing out loud. There was an audible gasp at one point when Paddington was in peril, and viewers young and old all sat up in their seats hoping against hope that our hero would survive. I went with a group of people of which I was definitely the youngest, the oldest being 78. This is definitely a film for the whole family.",2014

7,"Real-life link: Just for the record, I have never experienced that kind of snow in London and I have lived here for a very long time. So that is way beyond reality (tho I wish it will someday snow like that). However, one very true fact about London is that indeed everyone is different and because of that everyone can fit in and feel like home. The magic of London I guess. What the movie emphasised on was dealing with accepting that you are different and feeling comfortable with it. Sad however, to see that Paddington was only able to do that when the Browns did suggesting that the only way to be comfortable with who you are, is of those around you are. It is in many cases true but it shouldn't be and movie developed around this suggestion are indeed not helping to change that. ",2016

They were harmless, funny and engaging, and I remember being amazed at how funny they were, as a child, and that books could be funny. But this is not Paddington. To start with, what's all that rubbish about the explorer? It's for very young children, who can suspend belief and relax into a story - they don't need explanations as to how and why. Then the house (someone else has mentioned it) is not a normal middle of the road house, the humour changes and becomes over the top slapstick stuff with the bathroom scene. And a menacing taxidermist? What's that about? This is a story/set of stories for very young children who don't need to have the Bekesy's scared out them. Why not let kids just be kids and not have scary stuff forced at them? We have a couple of generations of screwed up kids, why make it worse?

As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. ",2014

While I have been more firmly opposed than most to boarding school bullying, in this case, the nobler the goal, the worse the writing. The film tries unsuccessfully to make Turing both a friendless quasi-autistic lone genius, and the head of the entire decryption project; neither point has any relation to reality, and barely cohere to each other. (I admit to some bitterness about this slur on my grand- supervisor, since it implicitly denies the existence of my graduate-school supervisor.)",2015
6,"This is a good enough movie, but skirts around the true story in order to make a clunky point about a genius hounded to death for his homosexuality. The plot is simple. Britain is losing the war and desperately needs something to have a chance of survival. Cracking Nazi codes to stop attacks at sea and in the air might just tip the balance. Step forward the secret decoding establishment at Bletchley Park, where expert mathematicians and linguists are recruited to try and break the famous codes sent via the German Enigma machines. And step forward one Alan Turing of Cambridge University, resident if gay genius played by Benedict Cumberbatch. To break the codes apparently Turing invents a machine to do this. Of course, this is all nonsense -the Poles had built machines previously to do this work and had broken Enigma, but with increasing sophistication they no longer had the resources so handed over their work to the British, along with a captured Enigma machine from the Wehrmacht. So tension mounts as Turing uses tons of money on a new (sic) totally innovative machine which does not seem to be quick enough. On the way an overly attractive Joan Clark (played by Keira Knightley), a double first, helps out and gets engaged to Turing, while silly old Commander Dennison played by Charles Dance tries to close down the machine!!!!! Eventually a chance remark and a realisation of something bleedin' obvious puts Turing and co on the right track. Just time for - we must not use all information or Jerry will know we have broken his codes, so little chat about who is saved and who isn't, which is pretty peripheral, before getting to the climax where Turing is chemically castrated by an unfeeling and totally ungrateful country. The thriller elements are okay, but Turing can do no wrong except tell Clark to leave Bletchley, which gets short feminist shrift! Oh dear, the script cannot help itself from being so terribly 21st century liberal in its preachy parts. A pity some other unsung heroes like Tommy Flowers and the Poles do not get a mention! The acting is fine all round, the direction serviceable, and it works at its own level, but the one man band tub thumping with Cumberbatch twitching and not looking directly at people (obvious Oscar material like 'Rain Man') really does a disservice to the great team effort of the wartime code breakers. Remember, an even more advanced, valve-based machine for breaking codes was developed with little participation from Turing by a working class GPO man - Tommy Flowers, who used his own money to finance it. Hope his story is not overlooked just because he was straightforwardly normal!",2014

This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Alan devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method. Shame Polish Intelligence was omitted in the movie.",2014
1,"There is a strong urge for me to create this spoiler-free review. Let me preface this. I'm a theoretical computer scientist, so somebody who does work in a very related area that was founded by Turing's work (use it almost daily). For a film that boasts that it is ""based on a true story"", it is a travesty to portray such a well- documented persons' life and the events related to this movie so inaccurately. The liberties taken by the film are so dishonest that nobody should use this as a factual story. Turing wasn't so simple to lay out, his papers are a testament to this. ",2015
2,"I am astonished at the rave reviews this film is getting and depressed  at how many people will now go through life with their impression of  Alan Turing and code breaking at Bletchley ""informed"" by this film.  The plot is drivel. If you take this film at face value you will leave  believing that Turing was single-handedly responsible for just about  everything at Bletchley including the original idea for the Bombe  machine not to mention constructing it on his own in a barn,  recruitment of staff, the first breaking of any Enigma traffic, the  idea of using known words to crack messages, making strategic decisions  about whether or not to save trans-Atlantic convoys and countless other  things.  Most of the film is just nonsense. There is no way that Turing would  have been in a position to decide not to save the convoy (or even know  that there was one to save). He wasn't responsible for the idea of  using standard text in messages as ways into the Enigma settings (which  had been done since before the war). The construction of the Bombe  machines was a huge exercise involving a team of technicians and parts  supplied by external manufacturers, not Turing wiring it up alone in a  barn in his shirt-sleeves. It wasn't actually even his idea; the idea  of using a machine was brought to him by Dilly Knox from pre-war ideas  worked up by a Polish team. Nor could the machine spit out deciphered  messages after a couple of minutes. Turing wasn't in charge either, he  didn't come up with ideas of using crosswords to find recruits and he  wasn't alone in writing to Churchill; several of them signed the  letter. Oh yes, and there were several women code-breakers at  Bletchley.  The screenplay is also riddled with anachronisms, which just add to the  sense of ""Oh this is ridiculous"" throughout the film. No way would a  well brought up young lady in the 1940s say ""Oh my God!"" three times in  as many minutes. There are too many others to recall or mention.  Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast are excellent in their  roles with the material they are given (hence two stars rather than  one) but that cannot save what is ultimately a very disappointing film.  This is not a biopic of Turing, which is how it is presented, but a  nonsensical made up story tacked on to a heavy-handed political point  about homosexuality, which we all got without the banner at the end.

With a slick exquisite script and an eclectic ensemble strong enough to deliver, it's an accessible film that although may feel familiar, is thoroughly refreshing, bringing laughter, tears and thrills. It will undeniably be a huge contender at the big awards this season, perhaps going all the way.",2014

9,"What the film lacks in my opinion is a seriously constructed drama. Although the film carries a certain amount of tragedy, somehow I couldn't managed to get deeper convened with the characters and complications they experiencing on a daily basis. Maybe it's because of the large number of one-dimensional characters. I'm not entirely sure. Although the script has some glitches, what definitely sells this movie and makes it worth a multiple of view is the brilliant performance of Benedict Cumberbatch. This brilliant British actor amazes us in the role of a brilliant but tortured genius. Because of him all the other elements of the film gets thrown in the background. The spectrum of emotions he gives is great, Benedict contribute so much that the film raises because of him a whole new level.",2015

10,"Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not cliché, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.",2014
1,"Last year, I made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch Frozen in theaters because I thought it would be a great Disney classic (like Tangled). Finally, I can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as Frozen. Thanks to my terrible experience with Disney's Frozen, I read the entire plot for this movie before watching it. Thankfully, I ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie, like Frozen, was not worth paying to watch. Maleficent was basically a non-animated, non-musical version of Frozen. Apparently Disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from Frozen with different characters! WONDERFUL. As expected, the main point was a rehash of Frozen's ""true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman"" because it sells well. ",2014
4,"With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and Jack and the beanstalk, both of which I was highly entertained and thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. ",2014
1,"I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty, since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice, she had the look, her costume was spot-on, and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly (and really, who could replace Eleanor Audley?). But one thing I've noticed over the past 10-15 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus, rather than story or character development. In the movie, Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.",2014
10,Maleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement.,2014

1,"Let me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many interpretations, she has simply been Evil (yes, with a capital E). So forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.",2014
9,I have waited a long time for this film and it did not disappoint!,2014
10,"Just had the pleasure of watching this. I was quite skeptical to begin with, I thought it would be the stereotypical story about an evil queen who'd taken over all the land to be defeated by some kind of hero because I'd never heard much about Maleficent's character before this. ",2016

1,"The movie is not worth, keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse. Is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece. Incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the Sleeping Beauty (Disney) is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations. ",2014
7,"Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!",2014
2,"I had my doubts before, but now I am sure if it.",2014
2,"This movie is a complete joke, the only thing going for it is the visual effects, In the 1959 Disney classic Maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all!",2014
10,"Didn't expect a masterpiece going in, but exited realizing ""Maleficent"" is one of the best, most beautiful films I've ever experienced.",2014
3,"I am very mixed about this film. Firstly, as many critics have singled out, I must praise Angelica's acting, mainly as the first good, then evil Maleficent. Now, while I could feel a little sorry for her being unable to bring this curse off Aurora, having to see, one of my best villains, Maleficent turn back into good is just unnatural. It ends up looking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake of young girls, who is only a little part of the audience, avoiding simple but effective scares and risks, basically throwing out what many Disney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes parts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course, most people don't rush into romantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making traditional relationships in past films happen, even though this is what happened in the era the film is set, is just horrid. I mean no offence to Frozen at all, since it is one of my most favourite Disney films of all time. But stealing the concept of real ""true love"" from Frozen is pathetic. If it wasn't for Disney with its stupid audience research, it could have easily looked even further into the darkness of Maleficent, which is almost no such thing in this film.",2014
10,"As a man who prefers science fiction to fantasy, I was pleasantly surprised by this superb film. It is a re-imagining of the classic fairy tale 'sleeping beauty' (at least I think so, as I have never read the original tale in the original language, and it may be that the Disney version with which we are all familiar is, in fact a re-imagining). The film is superbly directed; finely scripted, well acted, and is a joy to watch. The special effects are excellent, but are not overused. They are there when needed, and are spectacular, creating a magical world we can all appreciate. However, the thrust of the film is the changing relationships between the main characters, which are sometimes surprising and key to the story. Preconceptions from the accepted version of this story are overturned, and the altered relationships between the core characters provide a satisfying basis for a reappraisal of the whole concept of the story. This is a film that everyone should see, because I believe that almost everyone will enjoy it. I have no hesitation in recommending this to all viewers, of all ages.",2015
3,This movie fails to show why a remake was necessary. It fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall. It also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one Hollywood Star. ,2014
3,"The closing credit's lazy version of the classic ""Once Upon a Dream"" theme-song actually echoed how I felt after leaving this movie: drained and disappointed. ",2014
10,"I absolutely loved this film and the fairytale scenes. Plus I'm a huge Angelina Jolie fan. She made a gorgeous evil Fairy Godmother. I loved that this film gave a character that is supposed to be evil a new insight in to why she became wicked. Not only did the film give a reason of why she went from being peaceful to evil it gave Maleficent a chance to redeem herself. Not many films or even in life are people given that opportunity. I heard some bad comments on this film and so I thought film was not going to be as good as I imagined it to be. But to my surprise the film was excellent. It had many unexpected plot twists, a lot of action, and showed a different take on the definition of true love. Both young and mature audiences will appreciate this story brought to life via film. Great views on greed and great references on how society can and should live together in harmonious relationships.",2015

10,"Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). ",2015
10,"If you take the slick look of Drive and the satirical wit of Network, you get Nightcrawler. This film is a genius first film for director Dan Gilroy, it is darkly comedic, surprisingly disturbing and is brilliantly acted. The film tells the story of Lou Bloom, a freelance videographer who covers the crime world in LA for a local news station and ruthless editor played by Rene Russo. It isn't before long until Bloom's demented job overtakes his life, making him colder and colder the deeper he goes. The film plays like a twisted bloody version of Network and has the satirical wit to back it up. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. Lou Bloom is a role that he is completely submerged in and it oozes through every frame as our dislike for Bloom intensifies throughout the film. But what this film does best is not make us particularly like Bloom but it makes us wonder what he is willing to do next. And trust me, his actions get as sick and as shocking as they come. Bloom is a depraved individual and Jake Gyllenhaal deserves a hell of a lot acknowledgment for this role because he pulls off the tricky task of making the audience care about a character that is truly unlikeable and does so with not one false note. It is truly mesmerizing to see. The supporting cast including Rene Russo and Bill Paxton are absolutely great in this film and deliver career bests here. The cinematography also is top notch here, blending the awesome pallets of Drive with a bitter cold makes for an engaging view and makes it hard for you to peel your eyes from the screen. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy is someone to watch, especially coming out of the gates with a film filled with sheer and raw velocity like this one. It is not only an impressive first film but a brilliant film all around. I highly recommend it.",2014
8,This movie was both fun and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Lou Bloom will certainly frighten you. He is brilliant when paired with the amazing monologue style rants written for him.,2014
10,"From Welles to De Niro to Hanks to Bale, Hollywood has a history of actors going through extreme body transformations. While Gyllenhaal's intense weight loss will easily fit this trend, to only focus on that part of his commitment to Nightcrawler would be overlooking how impressively gone he is as Louis Bloom, the focus of this intense character study about an overlooked and disturbed individual. It's not a particularly ""pleasant"" film, and the pacing is far from quick, but the tension between Louis and his world progresses so beautifully as to pin you right to your seat. Nightcrawler is an effectively scary, uncomfortably funny, and stylishly gritty tour de force. The premise, plot and protagonist are truly unique: a sociopath becomes a freelance news-cameraman, stopping at nothing to succeed. Though his arc seems implausible, Gilroy crafts it smoothly, and Gyllenhaal's disturbed perfection make it hard NOT to believe. His unsettling bug-eyed expression and breathtakingly inappropriate smile are magnetic. Much like Scorsese's Rupert Pupkin, Bloom seems to believe he is the star of his own story: delusional, bull-headed, and respectably determined. Luckily, there is more here than just Gyllenhaal; powerful set-pieces resound, and the beautifully cool ambient guitar score is among the best of the year, complimenting Gyllenahaal's uneasy intensity. Even the camera consistently reminds us where Bloom stands in the deeply LA locale. At the heart, it's smartly calling out our propensity for praising characters for their desires, reminding us that compassionless ambition is extremely dangerous. For our fame-starved culture, Nightcrawler is a good message within a great movie with an even greater lead performance. A true don't-miss!",2014
9,"""Nightcrawler"" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don't detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.",2014
8,"Nightcrawler from the very beginning is not a traditional Hollywood film. It certainly does not follow the narrative of one and even though it has the three-act structure we are all familiar with, it spins them around. This is particularly evident in the third act, incredibly suspenseful with a brilliant, almost anti-climax. Suspense is the main key to this film's success, it build and builds to the point where the last twenty minutes of the film are completely unpredictable. Dan Gilroy in his directorial debut here has shown a real understanding of how to keep an audience engaged and following a character who isn't an easy man to spend a great deal of time with. Gilroy's screenplay is fast paced and one of the finest this year. The script focuses the audience on the characters, Louis Bloom particularly yet the supporting characters are just as impressive by Bill Paxton and Rene Russo alike. It doesn't follow the rules of a typical script, we are introduced instantly to a criminal and this man is supposed to be our protagonist. Yet what becomes clear is that there is not a protagonist in Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is the antagonist. He can be described as nothing less than a psychopath and his portrayal by Gyllenhaal is one of his greatest performances. He is very gaunt here, losing a lot of weight for the role, however that is not the main reason for his impressive performance. Gyllenhaal is an actor who continues to impress me; his work in Enemy from earlier this year was just as brilliant. He has chosen excellent roles in films such as Zodiac, Prisoners and End of Watch. The cinematography is also fantastic, night-time LA has not looked this good since 2011's Drive. All these elements come together to make a captivating piece of filmmaking, a film I expect will be discussed more as time goes on.",2014
9,"Nightcrawler seems like a satire to modern television news about how they choose their leads or often seek for more ratings by entertaining their viewers rather than aim straightly to the facts. But there is a much interesting story beneath here and that is the main character, Louis Bloom. The guy that easily manipulates people with his sinister tricks of persuasion. Everything else may just be the natural world of crime and accidents, but in the eyes of this character, the experience is made far stranger and oddly fascinating. This provides a compellingly menacing and provoking piece of commentary which results to such engrossing film.",2014
9,"Whereas Gone Girl explored the wild misconceptions and dangerous influence of the media, Nightcrawler explores another even more corrupted facet of the entity's nature: shamelessly capitalizing on the popularity of crime television—violence, murder, blood, gunshots. The program's ratings continue heightening along with the network's desire for even more thrilling footage. Nightcrawler follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he climbs up the ladder of success and builds a career through rash ambition. Lacking a formal education and adequate work experience, he's truly a victim of the unfair modern job market/unemployment. So, he says ""screw it"" and takes matters into his own hands, acting with sheer desperation and eagerness to reach that level of power and affluence America so often glorifies. ",2014
9,"Nightcrawler is slang. I will not ruin or spoil anything in this review. Jake Gylenhall has never been better. His character must have been incredibly hard to play, and you will see why. There is a reason this Thriller & Drama opened on Halloween. His character is ambitious to a fault & highly intelligent. He interacts most often with Rene Russo & a man he calls his intern. If you thought Julius Caesar was ambitious or Alexander the Great, this character must have the same motivation to succeed minus the goal of conquering the world. Needless to say he is driven. Russo is also ambitious, so they make a good team. The difference is how far each is willing to cross the lines of morality, legality & humanity. ",2014
10,"This is one of the few films that has held me in my seat from beginning to very end even when half way through I desperately needed to visit the bathroom . The storyline, script, filming and acting combine into the perfect storm of a brilliant film. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character, on what I can only describe as at the higher end of the autistic spectrum and deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. His character is perfectly matched by Rene Russo playing the role of her career as the success seeking ageing news editor. And a shout too for Riz Ahmed as Rick, Gyllenhaal's assistant. What a contrast to ""The Judge"" which I saw last week, ""Nightcrawler"" is superior on every level, go see !",2014
9,"Jake Gyllenhaal's Lou Bloom is an instant classic scuzzball character. He echoes the memorable sociopaths played by Robert DeNiro in his prime (Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy and Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver), but he's less sympathetic than either of those. A parasite on the prowl, Bloom soon fixates on a career ideally suited to his amoral loner/ go-getter character—as a crime journalist during L.A.'s night hours. He listens for crimes in progress on his police scanner, speeds to the scene, and then angles for the most shocking, risqué footage he can possibly get away with.",2014
10,Lou is a sociopath. Its established at the beginning of the film. Lou will beat you senseless for 100 feet of chain link fence and a fake Rolex.,2014
7,You leave the movie theatre with a slightly sick feeling of guilt after watching Nightcrawler. Guilt that you actually enjoyed this rather original movie-making set in an ethical and moral vacuum. In that sense the movie is entirely ironic. You shouldn't be enjoying this stuff.,2014
8,"This film essentially tells the story of an ambitious and somewhat psychotic news video freelancer (played by Jake Gyllenhall) who will do anything, literally, to make his way in the world and be successful and a media editor (played by Rene Russo) who,in her own world of news casting, also has few if any scruples when it comes to her career and reputation. Put the two together and you get an escalating set of events in which the video freelancer goes to greater and greater extremes to film shocking scenes of crime, encouraged along by the media editor who is paying for his results.",2015

It's not exactly the ideal way to make a living, and Bloom certainly aspires to greater things - he even lobbies unsuccessfully for a job at the scrapyard, but the manager isn't keen on hiring thieves. But while driving home, Bloom comes across an auto accident, with emergency personnel working frantically to free a woman trapped in the wreckage while the entire scene is being filmed by an independent cameraman (Bill Paxton) hoping to sell the footage to a local news station.",2014

This film and Gyllenhaal's performance were so mesmerizing that i was completely engaged in this movie for the full 2 hour runtime. Even in the few instances when there was not much happening on screen, i was at the edge of my seat at all times. The supporting cast from Rene Russo to Riz Ahmed also put in strong performances that only added to the overall quality of the film. Gyllenhaal really makes his character one of the most memorable characters of the year, one that stands out from all other films. When people mention Jake Gyllenhaal from now on, this will be the movie i think of first. There is never a dull moment in this very well directed and acted piece of art that i believe may even land Gyllenhaal an Oscar nomination.",2014
10,"The term ""psychopath"" is frequently used to describe murderers and other dangerous criminals, but in fact, it denotes an emotional disorder which limits or deletes the feelings for other people. Despite the stigmata entailed by the word, there are millions of perfectly functional psychopaths having normal lives, because their lack of compassion, remorse or affection doesn't automatically make them murderers. In fact, many businessmen and politicians are probably psychopaths whose rise is due to the fact that they never stopped to think in other people. The main character from Nightcrawler is one of those psychopaths. The screenplay and direction from this film are brilliant, and they would be enough reasons to make it worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation, but the main pro from Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal's monumental performance, which perfectly allows us to see an intelligent and organized psychopath quickly advancing in an unethical but legal (most of the time) business which is designed for people with null empathy for other human beings. Gyllenhaal's performance is truly magnificent, and he deserves all kinds of acclamation for it. Besides of that, Nightcrawler offers us a fascinating look into real ""nightcrawling"", and reveals the factors which promote it, starting by the fierce competition between TV channels and the obsession for the ""ratings"". But screenwriter Dan Gilroy (who was also the director) doesn't limit himself to seek corporative villains, but he also humanizes the struggle to have an audience in the shape of the character Nina, brilliantly played by Rene Russo. In conclusion, Nightcrawler is an extraordinary thriller with an excellent screenplay, perfect direction and great performances (besides of Gyllenhaal and Russo, I would also like to mention the perfect works from Riz Ahmed and the great Bill Paxton). I hope Nightcrawler doesn't end up being a ""hidden gem"", because it truly deserves to be appreciated and enjoyed... even though it leaves us uncomfortable and paranoid once we leave the cinema.",2014

Nowadays he choose very decent movies like Enemy or Prisoners, but Nightcrawler makes the difference, Birdman was my favorite but still this was one of the best five movies of this great year. By the way I still can't believe, that Jake Gyllenhaal didn't even get a Oscar nomination for his role as Lou Bloom, it's a shame that the Academy did not reward him at least for a pick. It was a tremendous performance from Jake Gyllenhaal sees him completely step outside of himself and into the body of Lou, an awkward, gruesome sociopath who most likely resides somewhere on the autism spectrum. I had almost the same feeling watching this as American Psycho or Taxidriver. Great work, can't wait to see Gilroy next move.",2015

The truth is the society fosters monsters like Jake Gyllenhaal and these monsters are but the reflection of the society we live in. If truth be said, I actually kind of liked Jake Gyllenhaal's character. He was creepy, cold, calculating and derelict of any morality, but at least he was not hypocritical, unlike the usual people. An intelligent take on the electronic media that dispenses news and the society that feeds on it lavishly. A must watch. It keeps it gripping though out and gives a lot to munch about later.",2014

10,"All I kept thinking while I was watching this show and their webisodes was, ""They get me."" Abbi and Ilana are freaking hilarious and play off each other perfectly. It is a great balance of comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously or become too stupid. It is not as depressing as ""Girls"", and not as cliché as ""2 Broke Girls"". Loved it! Not only did I fall in love with Abbi and Ilana's characters right away, but Hannibal Buress plays his role perfectly. Laughed out loud the whole time. If you get a chance, check out their short youtube clips of their webisodes. It's nice to see a show made with female comedians that are unknown. All of my friends that watch this keep saying, ""This is gonna be huge."" I agree completely.",2014

I think the people who don't like it, just don't get it, and it is unfortunate they write what they do. I also like how they don't pretend to be so ladylike, they are just funny and real.

I am a fan of Workaholics and Always Sunny... but where those shows use impossible situations and unrealistic scenarios, Broad City is very different. Maybe you have to be a chick living in the city, but no, my husband sitting next to me watching is laughing his butt off too. Awkward and stupid is funny, and I so get these broads. The first show I watched had me laughing to tears, and I thought maybe it might have been a fluke, but every episode I have watched since has been just as funny. I also want to point out that while many shows are funny, you have to admit the characters are so horrible as human beings that you really wish the worst fate on them. Not these girls... Their friendship is actually kind of sweet, and you are always really cheering for them. They also have some of the best friends ever, and I would give anything for the chance to party with this bunch.",2014

I had watched many commercials for the show and thought to myself ""ehhh, it doesn't look to interesting."" But I was highly anticipating the season premiere of workaholics, so after watching the new episode of workaholics finished, Broad City came on. When I was just about to change the channel, I started watching and watching. The show had me interested from the first 5 minutes of watching. Since the pilot episode literally started off with a girl on web cam chat while engaging in intercourse, I thought it was just hilarious and it made me think to myself ""if this show just starts off hilarious, I wonder what other crazy and hilarious antics this show can go to."" So I continued watching the show and the dialogue had me chuckling throughout the whole episode. When the episode hit the end, the part with the man who was pretending to be a baby had me in tears because it was soooo funny. By the time the episode was over, I had laughed so much that I literally couldn't believe that I wasn't even going to give the show a chance. The following week I watched the second episode and was not disappointed. The show is really funny. I basically see the show as like a really awesome, entertaining, and hilarious version of two broke girls. I love this show, I will continue to watch it and I hope it is renewed for a second season!!!!! I hope this review helps, and I encourage people to sit through a whole episode before feeling the need to judge!!!!",2014
8,"I was skeptical at first but now I'm hooked. I found it completely refreshing to have a female lead series that has a broad sense of humor that isn't gender specific. The show is basically about two women in their twenties living in New York City and the hassle that comes with it. Imagine the HBO series Girls but way funnier and more realistic. The show is carried by the 2 lead characters Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson. Their chemistry and comedic timing throughout the series suits them well.I found their friendship with one another completely authentic and truly charming. Although their roles are minor, support actors like Hannibal Buress, John Gemberling, and Chris Gethard help create funny characters for Ilana and Abbi to interact with. The scenarios are hilarious, the dialog is funny and the acting is great. As much as I personally enjoyed the first episode it wasn't until the second episode ""Pu$$y Weed"" that I became hooked. If you like workaholics or it's always sunny you'll definitely enjoy this. Comedy Central seriously has potential hit on their hands. I seriously recommend watching a few episodes before making your judgment.",2014
9,"Before the show actually started airing, I saw commercials and did not expect much from this show. When I watched the first episode, I was almost shocked how funny it was. Every episode makes me love the show more and more. The characters are great. Hannibal Buress is perfect, and he is barely in it (so far at least) and he is still just the 3rd best on the show. The two main characters are crazy, neurotic (well maybe only Abbi is neurotic), and hilarious. These are two woman that are not afraid to just be funny. The show reminds me of a mixture of workaholics and flight of the conchords. If you like to laugh, then give this show a chance, watch it open minded and not expecting too much).",2014
9,"I have seen the commercials promoting the show and didn't bother to watch for it--it's not that it looked 'bad,' just that it didn't appear to cater to me. I happened to catch episode seven, though, and it had me laughing several times with its circumstantial comedy. I decided to seek out the rest of the series and have seen up to episode three so far--I've thoroughly enjoyed it. I've noted some people liken it to Workaholics and I can attest that it has that pace and comedic tone. Though frankly, Workaholics has lost its luster to me after season two and I no longer look forward to new episodes. I do, however, look forward to continue watching this show. I could also see it compared somewhat to New Girl. If you like either of those shows, Broad City is worth a try.",2014
4,The distressing implication has always been that women can only be funny if they sink to the level of toilet humor; this show beats you over the head with that notion.,2016

2,"There's maybe 1 or 2 instances per episode where I let out a very slight chuckle. But the other 99.9% of the show is just two 20-something loser girls failing completely at life. They can't even function on a basic human level! They just smoke pot and go to their terrible jobs and be generally irritating. I was forced to watch it at a friend's behest. For some reason I cannot fathom, she sees this as empowering. Showing women acting like idiots and failures is not empowering. I literally could not sit through any more of this crap after the 4th episode. I got up and left, it was THAT bad.",2015
1,I had heard of this show but had no interest in watching it and it wasn't until I saw the constant barrage of gifs on Tumblr so I decided to give it a go.,2016
8,"I'd like to start out by saying the show is pretty funny, and follows the hi-jinx style of storytelling that Workaholics uses. It's very dialog based, and if you don't laugh at ""silly"" banter that's obviously pop culture driven then you will surely call the show ""dumb city"" like a few high brow user reviewers. Firstly this show is by no means a hipster show, and is literally the same thing as Workaholics just with women. The two main characters say funny things, do funny things, and you laugh. Hannibal Buress seems to have a reoccurring role, and he's hilarious. I think it's refreshing to have two funny women doing the whole Workaholics thingI literally just got annoyed enough at the 1 STAR ratings to write a review of what the show really is catering to. Like what were these people expecting? Some huge Girls style plot line, based in New York with ""classy"" wit and snarky remarks.cus that's hipster. It's a funny show, and has more than a few laugh out loud moments. I giggle at the image of the negative reviewers staring at the screen trying super hard to not laugh, and deeming everything dumb and unfunny. I can't stress enough that if you don't find Workaholics funnythen don't watch this.",2014

Extremely cringe-worthy, I can't go through a few seconds without wanting to kill myself because it's so horrible. Nothing to the show really, just two immature women with the maturity and intelligence of third graders. The people who praise this garbage only do it because it's one of the few shows with women playing lead roles. But for people with an IQ above 20, they will know better than to watch this show. Please watch something that's actually funny, like South Park. Spare your brain cells and stay well away from this show.",2016
2,"I am an Avid Pot Smoker... have been for most of my life. This past week on the Comedy Central lineup, both the plot of Workaholics and Broad City were all about smoking weed . I think I might be getting too old for this stuff now, but I'm sick of seeing these shows stereotype people who smoke weed like incompetent idiots. I also can't stand too see the glamorization of weed on these shows because its trying to bring weed down into the normal legal stratosphere. I believe this is bad because these shows are giving a huge misrepresentation towards what weed is really all about and its uses. What I'm saying is that I'm sick of devoting my time to each episode, when all it is some bratty hipster's complaining about the merits of holding a steady job when instead they could be smoking weed(Workaholics), same thing with Broad City but instead the idea rests in the characters incompetence to keep a job or function like a normal person( ex. ilana doesn't have underwear, sleeps all day at her job, can't complete normal tasks like replacing a television remote).. Television for young adults these day's is crippling because there is nothing your going to get out of it besides stupid laughs and will probably feel stupid afterwards for watching it. Beware of this kind of programming, it is creating a generation of lazy-ritalin addicted-weed smoking-hipsters.",2014
1,"What can I say about this horrible show that hasn't already been said? First off the rating on here is waaaay too high. I can only imagine it is what it is because so many stupid hipster girls think the leads are something to look up to. This show in no way should be compared to ""Workaholics"". The 3 guys are funny and likable because they aren't trying to be so damn cool unlike these 2 broads. And the writers actually write jokes. These Broads are so damn annoying because they think they are the coolest people in the world. I have watched several episodes(my stupid hipster roommate loves them) and I haven't laughed once but the crazy thing is my roommate didn't either yet she still loves them. She thinks these broads ""empower"" women when all they are really doing is playing into that stereotype that women aren't funny.",2015
1,"It's just your average female-oriented and pandering show - actresses that are clearly in their 30's are playing 20 year olds, as if it's believable, the show isn't funny whatsoever and on top of all is mindnummingly boring and stale. It's clear that they're on a budged but they could have tried a bit harder by sprucing an event and a scenery change here and there.",2016
1,"Maybe this show is so intelligent that it goes over my head. Or, maybe the comedy (if you could use such a description) is just so unoriginal and flavorless that i look down my nose at it. I myself prefer the latter. ",2014
1,My girlfriend and I were so excited for this show because we love Amy Poehler and we were so let down after watching it. We didn't laugh once. The characters are so annoying you just can't root for them. It's almost like they were banking on having ties to some actually funny people like Poehler and Fred Armisen. My girlfriend said she thought is was just way too unbelievable. At one point the two girls are skyping while one is casually using a dildo. Another skype session shows one girl in front of the toilet puking because she just ate pizza and is apparently bulimic. I know the show is supposed to be silly and ridiculous but those are things women would never show each other while skyping. My sister who actually liked their webisodes also said she was extremely disappointed. Again the two characters are just way too annoying and not funny at all. I have a feeling this show will run the 10 episodes Comedy Central ordered and then these two annoying hipsters will thankfully never be seen on TV again.,2014
8,"I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.",2014
9,"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.",2014
10,I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:,2014
6,"I went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason why I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland, short and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this with the usual expectation of seeing something ""new"".. well I was let down.",2014
10,"Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of most alleged blockbusters.",2014
8,"As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true).

10,OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again. ,2014
1,"For those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie will make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole movie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after the time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful sentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that you might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured in 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can Magneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A Football stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine would never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end of movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4. Finally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men 1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets killed? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the public is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based x-men story they make.",2014

9,"After the disappointing and directionless X3: The Last Stand and the  abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prospects for the continuation of the  franchise had gone from great to grim in just a few short years.  Desperate to breathe life back into the series, 20th Century Fox turned  to director Bryan Singer to help right the ship, and although Singer  didn't return to the director's chair, he oversaw production of X-Men:  First Class, an origin story centered on the friendship between Charles  Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) in their  early years.  A critical and commercial success, First Class set the stage for an  expanded X-Men universe featuring younger versions of the mutant  superheroes, but many fans still clamored for more adventures featuring  the original cast. With Singer back at the helm, X-Men: Days of Future  Past aims to balance precariously between the two, giving the original  on screen mutants one last chance to shine, while simultaneously  pushing the younger generation forward, and fixing a few glaring  continuity errors along the way.  The film opens with a tremendous action sequence in the near future,  where an army of mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels have driven the  X-Men underground. This sequence of events was set into motion some 50  years earlier, when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Bolivar  Trask, a military scientist and anti-mutant activist whose experimental  Sentinel program would only be accelerated by his untimely demise.  With only a handful of their kind remaining, and their numbers  dwindling seemingly by the second, the elder Xavier (Patrick Stewart)  and Magneto (Ian McKellan) discover that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has  the ability to transport a person's consciousness into their younger  self. It's a painful experience, one that Xavier is far too fragile to  withstand, but thanks to his innate healing ability, Wolverine (Hugh  Jackman) is the perfect candidate to be sent back to alter the events  that led to the destruction of the mutant race.  Waking up in his 1973 body, Wolverine is tasked with tracking down and  reuniting Xavier and Lensherr to stop the assassination of Trask. Easy  enough, right? Unfortunately, Xavier has become a bitter, reclusive  alcoholic, wasting away in his mansion with his only remaining friend,  Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), while Lensherr is incarcerated in the most  secure building in the United States after being implicated in the  death of President Kennedy. After all, as Xavier puts it, ""who else  could curve a bullet?""  Getting Lensherr out of trouble is a seemingly impossible task, but  Wolverine knows a guy. That guy is the young Pietro Maximoff, better  known as Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and his handful of scenes are some  of the most entertaining moments in the film, particularly an escape  sequence that conveys his super-speed abilities by shooting at 3000  frames per second. There have been glimpses of this moment during the  film's trailers, but the scene as a whole is staggeringly beautiful,  and the character's bizarre sense of humor provides a sense of joy and  playfulness that are noticeably absent from the rest of the film.  That's not to say X-Men: Days of Future Past is not enjoyable - on the  contrary, it's a thrilling experience from start to finish, with plenty  of emotional resonance to go along with all the action and special  effects. Jackman's performance is less growling menace and more wise  mediator, adding yet another dimension to an already complex character.  McAvoy and Fassbender still have remarkable chemistry, but the film  truly belongs to Lawrence, whose ability to emote through layers of  body paint and prosthetics makes Mystique more relatable than ever  before.  While it's a shame that most of the original X-Men cast are relegated  to cameos, those minor appearances tend to come during jaw-dropping  action scenes. The futuristic battles between the Sentinels and the  last remaining mutants are a joy to behold, with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)  finally using his abilities in ways that fans have always wanted to  see, and newcomers like Blink (Fan Bingbing) and Bishop (Omar Sy)  getting an opportunity to kick ass alongside the veterans.  There are also plenty of references to the previous X-Men films, as  Days of Future Past attempts to bridge the gap between the original  trilogy and the reboot. William Stryker (Josh Helman) is a looming  presence throughout the film, with his work evoking images of the  Weapon X program, and the final moments are full of fan service cameos  that effectively close the book on the original characters. For the  most part, it succeeds, and while there are still a few questions  remaining, there's so much to love here that the minor details no  longer feel relevant.  X-Men: Days of Future Past is a return to form for Singer, whose  directorial efforts since the first two films have been rather poorly  received. His emotional connection to the material and his love for the  characters has never been more evident, and the X-Men have never been  more compelling or entertaining. This latest installment proves there's  still plenty of life left in the franchise, and we can't wait to see  what comes next when the mutants return in 2016.  -- Brent Hankins",2014

3,"Let me first say I'm not a comic book fan, so I can't approach my review from that direction. But I did like the X Men movies (except for First Class), mostly because I loved the Wolverine. My favorite was The Wolverine, which I considered to be an excellent character study that made mutants feel believable in the real world- something which the X Men films lacked with their funny suits and spaceships. This movie, however, disappointed me greatly. I left the theater in a state of uncertainty and confusion, and with time to think about it, I realized why I didn't like it.",2014
8,"My love for the X-Men was not born due to the comics, or even the cartoons, it was the video games. So, off the bat, let me say while I may know characters faces, and a bit about their background, largely I am quite oblivious to the various universes and stories. So walking in I didn't know much besides fairly recent news stories dealing with Rogue's part being cut, to Kitty seemingly being the one who was supposed to go to the past. Outside of that though, I was a clean slate. Making the movie quite the experience, even if sometimes confusing and surely with details lacking.",2014
6,"The timeline of the X-Men movie franchise has been troubling ever since the supposedly conclusion of the series, X-Men: The Last Stand. The studio continues to make more of these by telling each of the mutants' origin stories, but it wasn't quite a success due to leading to a grope of making two awful Wolverine movies and a main prequel that doesn't know where to go afterwards. A solution to fix this is simply time-travel. With all the space time continuum and stuff, it finally has the chance to amend the universe and unhappen the unwanted events of the last movies. In that way, X-Men: Days of Future Past triumphs. The movie itself does need to be a little economical in its exposition, but as a blockbuster it is quite a solid entertainment.",2014
1,"(Spoiler Warning) I'm really scratching my head on this one guys, this movie's been hailed as ""The best x-men movie ever!"" I'm sorry, but I REALLY have to disagree on this one. Before I state all the reasons why I hated this movie, let me start off with two positive comments: Hugh Jackman is still good as Wolverine, and the character of Quicksilver, was pretty cool. Now for the numerous reasons as to why I hated this film. So we start off looking at a destroyed, post apocalyptic, landscape that looks like it was ripped off from the first two Terminator movies. We then get some narration from Charles Xavier. He explains that most of the mutant population has been enslaved or killed by these killer machines known as sentinels. Then we see a small group of mutants who are both hiding, and trying to fight the sentinels. Xavier tells them that the only chance for the mutant race to survive, is to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of a government scientist, which in turn prevents the deployment of the sentinels. So Wolverine is sent back through time, and must prevent fellow mutant Mystique, from doing the deed. You would think that a plot involving time travel would be intriguing and interesting right? Well not in this movie! There's almost no action, The actors are bland, and you couldn't care less for any of the characters! That's only the tip of the iceberg folks! What really kills it is the fact the the plot has more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese! Before I talk about that though, let me back up a bit. When ""X-men first class"" came out, I thought to myself: Okay cool, they're rebooting the x-men franchise and making a whole new series."" Turns out they weren't, the only reason why ""X-Men first class was made, was so that they could create a whole new continuity that they could smash together with the old continuity. The result of this, is a clusterf*cked mess! This film won't leave you feeling good or entertained, it will only leave you with a head full of questions. Such as these: Why is Xavier alive in the future, when we clearly saw him being killed by the phoenix in part 3? Why does Wolverine have bone claws in the past, but metal claws in the future? Why does Xavier claim to have known Mystique since she was a child, when there was no indication of that in the original films? Why does Wolverine claim that in the future he and Hank McCoy (Beast) are friends when there was no previous indication of that? In the climax of the film, the sentinels have already been built. Even though they succeed in their mission, what's there to stop someone else from using them? How does Wolverine survive for so long underwater? Did Mystique perform the adamantium experiments on Wolverine? Why and how are Cyclops and Jean Grey alive again at the end? This movie doesn't even so much as attempt to answer any of the questions that it leaves the viewer with! Frankly, it would be easier to solve a Rubik's cube on LSD than it would be be to figure this movie out! So far, I've never been impressed with ANY of the X-men films. 1 and 2 were lame, 3 was garbage, and this one was even worse! I'm done with this franchise! I don't care what they do with the next film, I've put up with all the incompetence I can take! From now on, it's just the x-men comics and cartoons for me. Sorry 20th century fox, but you guys blew it!",2014

That said, Michael Keaton and the cast give wonderful if sometimes overacted performances. You can see why critics like it - it's not the pap that they are forced to view day in and day out because it's their job to watch it. Professional critics, for their own sanity, grasp at any opportunity to promote something different or unusual. But just because it's good for them doesn't make it good for us, the casual movie goer. Since this is a play within a movie that is set in a theater, I got the feeling that there are inside jokes that those in or familiar with the business (such as critics) will get but which is over the heads the audience.",2014

Actually to be honest i have now long given up on what critics say and write about a film. Virtually critic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of what is good or bad.

Here, as the director, he is self-indulgently showing off his abilities to the audience - watch me use time-lapse photography instead of cutting to move the time of the action along; see how I have learnt how to move my actors around the set from my regular viewing of the""live"" episodes of ""Coronation Street""; aren't I clever in the way I track my camera from the outside of a building into the inside via a balustrade and a window; what about the way I position my camera within the confines of a dressing room so that you don't see it recording what's going on inside - all this trickery highlights his inability tell a story in a way that involves the audience. I was looking forward to seeing Michael Keaton show his acting chops in a role that he was born to play - washed-up TV star trying to make a comeback into celebrity and the acting game in general but flirting with madness whilst trying to do so but his ""Birdman"" alter-ego kept getting in the way at the behest of his director. But his was not the only talent that was wasted. The rest of the cast were similarly handed caricature-driven roles that they could do nothing new with - Edward Norton playing a ""prima donna""actor brought in to bolster the box- office appeal of the play and who has his own ideas on how to play his role; Naomi Watts playing an actress given her first role in a Broadway show and being crippled by nervousness to the extent that she is sick prior to the opening night performance; Andrea Riseborough as Keaton's new girlfriend possibly impregnated by him and not sure how to deal with this; Zach Galifianikis as the producer only worried about the money and the show's success; Emma Stone as Keaton's ex-drug addict daughter trying to keep Keaton and herself stable as Keaton goes off the rails - is there anything new here? I don't think so. The only reason I give this film one star is because of a short scene between Keaton as actor and Lindsay Duncan as Broadway theatre critic were she attacks him as a Hollywood invader of the ""High Art"" of Broadway and he attacks her for just being a labeller of theatrical types. This scene happens towards the end of the film and sadly comes too late to save it from its crassness. What a film it would have been if this had been the theme running through it. ""The Sweet Smell of Success"", ""Topsy-Turvy"" and even ""The Producers"" need not worry about their reputations for examining the theatre and the folk that work within and outside it. They are classics. This film is decidedly not.",2015
10,"This movie really touch my soul in very different ways, I was laughing and crying at the same time when I was watching it. Alejandro's clean smooth directing really states a new canon in the way a movie is conducted, I was blown away with Michael Keaton's perfect performance and the rest of the cast did well around him. I had never seen this kind of genre called ""Magical realism"" as well as in this movie, it really submerge you inside the head of the main character and the brilliant drum-based score helps to explain the situation by the minute. I am very happy with the Oscars won by Alejandro (well deserved) especially because I am Mexican too. I know that this kind of movie is not for everyone, some people said that it is boring, pretentious, over-the- top, strange, difficult to understand, hideous. But let me tell you this movie is fascinating, touching, funny, sad, eloquent, fantastic and dramatic. I liked very much how it makes fun of big-budget summer-blockbusters hero-movies which easily Alejandro will have done if he had wanted but no, he preferred an artistic low budget movie that make you feel instead of make you eat popcorn.",2015
1,"Coming in to this movie, I had heard bad things from people who had  seen it but great things from critics. After leaving, the only good  thing about it was the acting. This movie definitely was different and  unique, but there's a difference from being different and making art  and being different and making a piece of crap. The fact that this  movie was nominated for best picture above a piece of art, such as  Interstellar, is appalling. I do applaud the director for taking a risk  and trying to make an unconventional movie, but he needed to first  develop a plot in order to make a good movie. I strongly discourage  anyone from wasting their time and money seeing this. If you want to  watch a movie that is different and considered art, watch any  Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, or Quentin Tarantino movie, not  this pathetic excuse for entertainment. And to critics, please learn  the difference between unconventional artistic movies and this bloody  rubbish.",2015
9,"Great opening at the Venice Film Festival with this must-see movie. The story of an actor persecuted by the role that made him popular, ""Birdman"", and pressured by the willing of proving himself on stage with his new play.",2014
1,"After I watched this movie last month, I have had to come to IMDb every other day, sort the reviews, and read those below 5/10 in order to get this off my chest.",2015
10,"I think we've all been exceptionally good this year because Christmas came early with Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterful ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),"" an experience that you won't soon forget. Debuting at Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, the film closed an already impeccable New York Film Festival on Saturday morning for press and industry colleagues. It's a film that resonates profoundly, and may just be the best film of 2014. From its pristine writing (by Iñárritu, Armando Bo, Nicolas Giacobone, and Alexander Dinelaris), to its carefully constructed direction and cinematography, to its genius casting and performances, ""Birdman"" is just a dream of a movie.",2014
1,"It took me two nights of sheer will power to get through this piece. Masterpiece? I don't think so. I had a lot of hope for this movie, given the stars. And I don't need a lot of action or special effects... but a good storyline will win me over every time. Sad to say this lacked in all categories, even the acting was not believable. Even the so called super hero Birdman is laughable. I guess judging by the reviews, you are either going to love this or hate this. My advice to you, if you like the first 15 minutes, then keep watching, you might even consider this a masterpiece. However, if after 5 minutes, you think it's going to get better? You best turn it off and don't waste your time.",2015

2,"It is the most boring film ever. I wonder why so many people love it. Every time I started to get interested, they would play that annoying jazz drumming. My friend said it was better than ""The Judge"", not even close. From start to finish, that moving is an interesting story. From start to finish, I didn't care about any of the characters in this film. It won't get wide release because it won't appeal to most people. I have a theory that it will appeal to people that like jazz. It'll win awards because it appeals to critics. Oh, a spoiler, the plot is boring. I will say the actors did a really good job. I didn't have a headache when I went in but by the end of the film I did.",2014
10,"wow, i did not see that coming. unfortunately , it's rare to see this amount of dedication and talent in contemporary mainstream American cinema these days. i was expecting a dull drama with good actors and an OK script, and i got this: pure , unfiltered , proper effort , applied in modern American commercial standards. Alejandro González Iñárritu's brilliant direction creates a mesmerizing blend of genres , it's captivating from first shot,bittersweet and painfully realistic. made with high technical complexity and deep character study - and with so much to say about love , art and the the human soul, ""birdman"" is still coherent and crystal clear. great performances by all actors ,Michael Keaton is pushing the limits here (in a good way), Emma Stone and Naomi Watts are sharp and enigmatic , and Norton is kicking like it's 1999. with an outstanding script to support their performances ,and original and intriguing soundtrack. no wonder it's the real deal.a new favorite for me.",2015
1,"Not sure what all the fuss was about. Okay The acting is very good, but as far as the storyline goes, truly weak. Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, how can a film so depressing be classed as a comedy? The most annoying part is the constant drumming throughout. Enough to drive the viewer to madness. I was expecting big things from this production, but it has failed in all areas that a good film should succeed in. The funniest part was certainly Edward Norton's boner! Other than that my partner and myself found it hard to keep watching without wishing it Was over. This film seemed almost desperate and awkward at the same time.",2015
1,Regarding the plot: Points at which the movie could have ended still have had some kind of minimal impact:,2015
1,"This is the first review I am writing, because I could not miss to warn others not to watch this movie. Screening the fact that it is rated very high (no idea why) I have waited long time. It started promising, but after a few minutes it became clear that this movie will not be interesting at all. I give 1 star only because of the performance and effort of Keaton and Norton. The rest of the cast was not very impressive. Also irritating was that the whole time the movie is dark, most of the action takes place in the corridors of a very old theatre. They have tried to film the whole thing and have the effect of 1 take (1 shot). Complete failure. Horrible movie, avoid and don't waste your time.",2015
1,"I would like to give it a negative rating, but it is not possible, so there you go. It was by far the most useless, meaningless, depressing movie I've ever seen. It was actually a piece of sh.t. I wasted two hours of my time on a 'story' of a schizophrenic character, where the story didn't unfold in any way. In the end he flew out of the window, or at least that's what his daughter saw, who - I suppose became also schizophrenic or the movie turned into a fantasy movie. The camera movements were very annoying, the whole movie seemed to be shot by a steady-cam, this made you feel claustrophobic. I should have spent this time kissing with my date instead.",2015
9,"With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters – along with some secondary characters we've seen before – providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow.",2014
10,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...",2014
10,"Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",2014
10,"Now ""The winter soldier"" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. ",2014
8,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, ""Everything special about you came out of a bottle!""",2014
9,"Marvel showed pretty clearly in Iron Man 3 that they are not afraid to take risk, bend comic stories and venture into unknown territories. I was pleasantly surprised by Captain America : The Winter Soldier because Marvel is able to do surprise audience like never before. This movie has mostly everything a fan could ask for. A political drama, conspiracy theories, Chris Evans portrayal of a ""out of his time"" superhero who is trying to blend in with the world and thinks that ""Internet is helpful"", typical Marvel's laugh out loud moments and above all some mesmerizing action sequences. Threat in this movie is not as big as the one in Thor :The Dark World since only our tiny planet is at stake rather than entire 9 realms with imaginative difficult to pronounce names, but thanks to some very smart blend of direction, acting and close to perfect background scores, threat seems to be much bigger and more importantly, real this time. You actually care for the fate of entire planet and characters. You do come face to face with the full potential of SHIELD and its structure, its influence on world politics and when the actual villain is revealed, you just cannot hide your excitement. SHIELD acts as a central character in the movie and shows itself to be far bigger and complex than what we suspected after watching all the Marvel offerings. There is Nick Fury as usual hiding secrets, keeping secrets and digging secrets but watching him vulnerable in this movie is much better than watching him acting all almighty in Avengers. Chris Evans shine in this role and I can imagine he won't be at the bottom of favorite Avengers list after this movie. His portrayal of Captain America is near perfect. Scarlett Johansson is a surprise package in the film portraying Black Widow character. She gets ample screen time presence this time, even in scenes where she is not kicking someone. It is actually the first time we learn something about Black Widow, duplicity in her character just adds tension to the already built suspense in the movie. Sebastian Stan is good in his portrayal of winter soldier. He is a perfect nemesis to Captain America in the movie. I bet you haven't seen such creative combat scenes between these two ever before. Action here is not as loud as Thor movies, it is more real, every bullet which find its target hurts, every punch delivered matters, it is so enjoyable to watch just because it is so real. I wish I could write about some more characters but that will be giving away some key points. Please be assured there are some great character comebacks, some you expected, some you didn't. I was a little let down by the climax of the film by its simplicity after the real motive of the real villain is revealed, but of course you have to remember its a Marvel film, there doesn't exist any situation alien/political/social which can't be solved by few explosions and kicks. Overall it's a highly entertaining film from Marvel, I will put it behind only Avengers and first Iron Man, this movie deserves your weekend. And of course it goes without saying, don't dare to leave your seats until last credits have rolled out, you have probably all heard the rumors about Joss Whedon directing the end credit scene. Yes it is awesome and offers an insight into the next Avengers movie.",2014
10,"I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category. It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, fun and superbly done.",2014
9,"I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. If it's action you want. Go see the Captain.",2014

Jackson, tough as usual, for him and these) is attacked by an unknown enemy, the Captain(Evans, will of steel, heart of gold) and Black Widow(Johansson, sultry and devious – this uses her right, finally) find themselves(they have a great chemistry, with a charming running gag of her wanting to pair him up with a girl, going through a list of ones they both know; and with his straightforward nature, and her relative lack of integrity, they both affect the other towards them, benefiting both) with no one else to trust, except perhaps the veteran Falcon(Mackie, amiable), as they uncover a genuinely devastating truth, while on the run from a considerable force – including the elusive assassin, The Winter Soldier(Stan, terrifying, pure awesome pretty much every second he's on screen).",2014
3,"Captain America The Winter Soldier is supposed to be a AAA Hollywood movie. Apparently this means that it only needs explosions to be good. If you dare to demand a logical consistent story you will be unsatisfied. The acting is good, the explosions are just the same as in every other marvel movie. The story is very obvious and the supposedly surprising changes are foreseeable by a 10 year old. My biggest problem is the logical inconsistency. In the following a few examples: SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The propulsion of Director Furys car is destroyed by an explosion, and the damage is fixed by restarting the PC of the car. highly impossible no matter the technological level.",2014

4,"we all know that marvel films sometimes lack in plot, but in such cases they usually compensate with: a)humor b)good acting c)creativity and originality. this film - none of that whatsoever. a predictable plot (first 10 minutes and you already know who the bad guy is), shallow characters, disappointing acting, tedious action scenes with only loud noises to keep you awake...simply a tragedy. The few quips here and there are far from enough for a two hour movie, which on top of that presents quite a dull, grayish setting - no eye candy at all (shame on you marvel). and for a character who pretty much makes up the title of the movie, the winter soldier was...just there - no impressive lines, no stable back story. i think that this movie aimed a bit too high, but ended up being illogical, painfully predictable and all in all - laughable. marvel tried serious? well, marvel failed at serious.",2014
1,"Never have I watched a movie with so many clichéd lines, excessive use of firearms and complete lack of credible story line. Plot twists were tedious and lines were forced and overacted. I believe Marvel has taken a turn for the worst. Why couldn't have been as well acted and written as the Avengers? Instead we are given a mockery of all superhero movies to date. We have been presented with unnecessary amounts of CGI and guns and killing. Superhero movies are supposed to present morals. How can a superhero movie depict a couple of characters running around shooting at each other and killing massive amounts of people in the process. In my opinion just plain awful. I can't but I'd rather give it a 0/10. (Only giving this review for the people with good taste in movies and are not forced to watch it like I was)",2014

3,"I wanted to start this review by saying that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is astonishingly bad, but that gives it too much credit: The Winter Soldier is not astonishing in any way. It is yet another mediocre superhero movie from Marvel. It teased at interesting questions, like, ""Is it okay to kill people to prevent them from killing people?"" but all it did was tease. The movie changes up Marvel's movie universe a little bit, but for what purpose? So another superhero can save the day next year in a slightly different way while uttering slightly different one-liners? In the end, the movie is about an uncompromising good guy who saves people from dying. That's not interesting in the world of fiction; it's overused.",2014
5,"The main problem from Divergent is that its premise is too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. If the story had been ingenious enough to justify so many conditions and unearthly circumstances, there wouldn't have been any problem. But no... this is simply another juvenile tale about the typical main character who must overcome her insecurity when she finds out she's ""special"", and her actions escalate until she practically saves the world... without forgetting, of course, the ""unexpected"" romance in the road to her destiny. Well, I'm speculating about saving the world. Divergent is based on a series of ""young adult"" novels I haven't read (and I will never do so), and the producers obviously expect to shoot sequels, so this first film establishes the (absurd) post-apocalyptic world, the bland characters and the obligatory conspiracy in which NOTHING IS LIKE IT SEEMS (translation: everything is exactly like it seems, from the predictable villain to the gallant who starts being a hateful lout, until he softens himself and shows his romantic side). In other words, a simpleton and innocuous teenage fantasy made for female spectators; and another attempt to create the saga which will inherit the crown from The Hunger Games... something which isn't precisely bad. Divergent was made for a very specific audience, and I sincerely hope that the female fans of the novels are left satisfied by this film. For the rest, the production values are pretty high, the special effects are competent and the cast is composed in a big part by attractive multi-cultural young people who seem taken from a catalogue of Urban Outfitters (what a luck for the post- apocalyptic world). I don't know how the casual spectators can take Divergent; in my personal experience, it bored me very much (specially during the ""exciting"" conclusion full of action), but I'm very far from belonging to this film's objective audience. Each one will know his/her posture and tolerance to this kind of film; I personally regret having wasted my time and my money on it.",2014
2,"As I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for the 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could not believe that there would be so many clichés and unrealistic scenes. Instead of an ""action/adventure film"" I saw a boring love story. I can't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the book..",2014

9,"I took my 12 year old son to the movies on a ""guys day out"" last weekend. We left Mom and sister/daughter at home. Anyway, we had a great time and it was a good movie to take my kid to see. I must say this isn't a hugely serious review, but a review nonetheless. When a movie leaves me thinking about it for days or weeks after I watch it, there is something to that. There is also something to be said about how this story relates to modern present society. Square pegs go into square holes, and when someone is too divergent, they seem to suffer in our shallow, worker bee society. The movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end, however I felt like there was no closure in the final scene. This is probably because the story is a series, as it should be, if it's based on the books. I loved the way the movie made me think about myself. This is where the genius of this film blossoms. Everyone I've talked to about the film, and everything I've read on the Divergent fan site is rooted in how people feel about themselves and how they fit into our current society and culture. Because all the excitement, plot, and direction of the film is borne out of the Dauntless faction, I've noticed that everyone who's watched the movie now wants to be Dauntless. Why not? It's exciting and they are pretty bad-ass with the black clothing and tattoos. For me personally, I was Dauntless as a former cop who sports his share of ink, but now a full fledged Candor or maybe even an Abnegation since I'm one of five running our local government. Really, I'm Divergent like most people. We generally don't fit into one category as human beings and that's the moral of the story here. Human nature is eternal and cannot be curbed no matter how you structure your society. The film as a whole was really well done. The plot flows, the tension is always there, the mystery seeps in now and then, and the action is outstanding. The lead actress is pretty, yet tough and smart, but young and has a lot to learn. That is the point though. Bottom line is that I loved the movie and I'm still thinking about it a week later. I will definitely own the movie when it comes out on disc. I can't wait to play it for my wife and daughter.",2014
1,"I have read all three books written by Veronica Roth. I came in with expectations of character profiles and I reviewed the characters on IMDb. I understand that all book-to-movie adaptations make it difficult to fit in all the elements and are not perfect. It's impossible to portray the book word for word. Despite knowing all of this, I came in with a low expectation.",2014
5,"I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.",2014
7,"Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.",2014

3,"I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.",2014
1,"This movie was terrible. It was awful. And infuriating. It made no sense. This movie is the epitome of crap. In fact, instead of watching this near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a better plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes (precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the ""government"" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather focuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear what they do. It gives no reason to why they are in ""factions"". There were so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The guys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought, ""Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway."" Four. Why? Why? WHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make money, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they at least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better acted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when Tris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a matter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems like the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way too much wrong about this movie. If I continue I will only be hurting myself by spending more than ten minutes thinking about this movie.",2014
5,"When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.",2014

1,"I was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin thought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books before I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few things I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four is confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In the movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut from Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't include a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew. They barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and there seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing in the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was no significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the book. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you don't really get to know any of the characters well, the character development was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't really tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked pretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many changes added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape it seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight him off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off. Edward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that was an incredibly important scene.",2014

The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. ",2014

8,"I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.",2014

1,"Of course this movie is made for a very young female audience so I have problems to identify myself with the targeted audience. The good point about the movie is, that the heroine is not complelty depending on her male counterpart, so its none of the ""girls-are-mentaly-and-physically-too-weak-to-exist-without-man"" movies, but thats about it. If you want to watch something about strong female characters try the legend of Korra. The rest of this movie is terrible, especially the huge amount of brain bleeding inducing logic errors.",2014
1,"If this is truly based off a book, then God help those who actually thought this movie was good. Personally I have not read the books, although from what I saw in this movie, I am glad I never have. What kind of movie is this anyway? There was nothing pinnacle about this movie, nothing iconic, nothing that caused me to want to get up out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs that was incredible because its all been done before. The army being controlled for God's sake was a pathetic attempt at being the slightest bit menacing, if menacing was what they were going for, it was pathetic. Then don't even get me started on the point where Tris gets to Kate Winslet, seriously!! No security to guard the most important person in the whole movie, the person who was behind the taking over of ABNIGATION, seriously?! Okay. There was barely any character development in any of the other characters except for Tris and Four and even that was done poorly (the revelation that the father beat Four when he was younger, if the movie really wanted fear to be felt, my God they failed). This movie SCREAMED young adult book, but then again the Hunger Games was a young adult trilogy, and all I could do was cover my mouth and hope the characters didn't die, and I know there is a part one and two coming out soon. This movie left no cliffhanger, nothing to the imagination, nothing to make a person ponder positively over what they just saw, it just happened to happen. There was nothing that dazzled and that is something I am noticing in most movies coming out these past few years. There isn't an elaborately put together story, its just put together in the way that's most clear to its audience, it is almost as if creators of movies nowadays don't want a thinking audience. AND THAT IS SAD, as sad as this movie was. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, due to its soggy and cringe-worthy script, poorly placed emotion, and over-told story. Thank God I got Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games, and Marvel movies to save me from movies like this. Seriously folks do not waste your money on this movie! I am giving this movie a five out of ten due to the fact that it tried, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as it could've been.",2014

And so 'Divergent' comes with high hopes that not only will it become hit YA property, it could potentially enjoy the same astronomical success as 'The Hunger Games', especially since both are of the sci-fi genre set in a post-apocalyptic world with fresh young faces.",2014
9,"Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.",2014

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself.

The thing about movies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same things over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However, every time there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were also elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be admired.",2014
8,"With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited 're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again.",2014

6,Take the 1993 classic Bill Murray flick and make the short furry guy the star minus the comedy and include lots of guns and you have Edge of Tomorrow. Interesting in theory except it completely throws the entire concept of linear time out the window with the 2nd or 3rd revival. If the actions of a single person do not change the outcome of everyone around them then this movie makes perfect sense. Why altering ones choices does not result in a completely different outcome is completely against the theory it is based on (but it is still entertaining to watch which is why it got a 6 instead of much lower). If looking for something intellectually stimulating this is not the answer. Want stuff that blows up and is loosely based off of sci-fi folk-lore this is the movie for you!!!,2014

4,"I had high hopes that Fury might end the dry spell of good WWII movies. I could have forgiven the checklist of war movie clichés Fury manages to work in had it not been for a laughable final battle more akin to something from The Expendables than a serious war movie. The final battle consists of scenes where a battalion of seasoned SS soldiers run back and forth through our heroes' machine gun fire, only stopping when it is time for a forced emotional exchange inside the tank. While the director chose to have every other enemy brandish an anti-tank weapon in the ominous lead-in to the final battle, for some reason only three of them are fired, two which miss at unrealistically close range. The ridiculousness of it all turned me into that obnoxious movie goer that laughs out loud during what should be a serious and emotional scene. ",2014
1,"This film gave me a feeling of initial distaste, which rapidly grew to anger, and yes FURY, as the story line progressed. Compared to the masterful 'Saving Private Ryan' this film was a prime example of how to make a piece of garbage and, with a major star in the leading role and good marketing, turn it into a box office winner. Where do I start? Well, the tank crew is a bunch of thugs who look as if they just came out of jail - yeah we saw it all before in the 'Dirty Dozen', the 'Bridge at Remagen' and so on. But these guys had no redeeming features at all - just a bunch of psychopaths with guns. Even the Brad Pitt leading character took pleasure in killing enemy prisoners and encouraging the innocent young recruit to do likewise. Yes, these ugly incidents did happen in the war, and US soldiers were often guilty of such 'heat of the moment' atrocities, but they were exceptions, NOT the rule! And to make this behaviour seem normal is highly irresponsible, not to say defamatory to the US Army. Then there is the perpetuation of the old myth about the Waffen SS being cruel maniacs etc when in reality they were highly disciplined and effective soldiers who often behaved more correctly than the Wehrmacht. The apex of stupidity came in the long climactic final scene in which the Pitt character and his three colleagues kill hundreds of SS troopers with a single broken down Sherman tank before finally being overwhelmed and killed - the naive young recruit being the only survivor. I could not believe what I was seeing. This is war for the video gaming generation, not for anyone who has actually gone through this hellish experience. The Germans ran around like headless chickens and let themselves be mowed down by machine gun fire like turkeys. This is so unbelievably moronic that it makes one cringe with embarrassment. I felt I should have asked for a refund after watching such crap. Awful.",2014

1,"I recently saw the new movie ""Fury"" with Brad Pitt, and keep reading how ""realistic"" it is supposed to be. Here is my take on this movie (SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills an unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member ""how to kill"". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him. His company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank platoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march discipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire platoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very cynical version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with some ""Cross of Iron"" thrown in. It reminds me of those ""Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"" comic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the ""Ghost Tank"" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that this scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The vast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not psychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and knowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of Hollywood WW II, not the real one. Brad Pitt's character needs to be given a Section 8.",2014

3,Why is it that WWll lasted as long as it did? After all the Germans in all these movies are killed by the bushel and have absolutely no tactical battlefield ability! Fury brings this to a new height with the final battle scene. An entire SS Battallion armed with Panzerfuasts decides to attack a disabled Sherman Tank frontally not once but repeatedly! Say Hans you think it might be better to pin them down with fire and circle round to the rear of the tank to finish it off with the Panzerfausts? No I think sacrificing the entire battalion in a frontal attack makes more sense. Besides doing it the right way destroys the tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war. Please Brad stop playing Achillies in every movie!,2014
2,"Brad Pitt killing Nazis again. This time in a tank. Possibly, no probably, the worst movie I have ever seen. Horrible. Last scene: Brad Pitt's tank is set to hold an important crossroads. Loses tread on mine. Lookout spots 250 SS infantry troops on the way, with an armored car or two. Brad Pitt says were gonna duke it out. (um, I haven't been in the army, but I would at that point hide in the woods and call an air strike. Long columns of troops hate being strafed by fighter planes.) SS gets up to the tank and then the tank opens fire. Kills a bunch of SS. Germans send wave after wave of infantry guys with machine guns against tank. (somehow, even though it is April 1945 and the Germans have been fighting for 7 years or so, they don't realize a machine gun can't hurt a tank.) They have a guy with a bazooka but he positioned himself at the front of the tank and the tank shot him first. Not sure why he didn't walk around to the rear to the immobile tank and blow it up. After a hundred or so Germans have been killed by doing wind sprints in the limited field of fire, Brad Pitt says the hell with it with it stands on the top of tank and shots more Germans. He is silhouetted against a burning building and a wily German sniper sneaks up. He hits Brad Pitt 3 times, but Brad Pitt crawls back into tank. (Hmmmusually one shot is all a sniper needs. This sniper goes for the rarely used ""shoulder shot""). At this point there is only Brad Pitt and one other guy left. The other guy says ""Sarg, Im scared."" Brad Pitt also discloses that he too is scared. German opens the top hatch and drops two of those weird looking hand grenades a foot away from Brad Pitt. Must of maxed out the timers, because Brad Pitt has time to tell the other guy its OK to run and there is a bottom hatch he can use. The guy opens it and drops to the ground. Two explosions rock the tank. The guy crawls in a hole beneath tank. Bunch of SS troops are milling about the tank. One peeks under the tank with a flashlight, he sees the American, but pretends he didn't. Lots of the SS guys were pretty OK dudes I guess. American goes to sleep. Wakes up next morning the Germans are gone. He goes into tank, instead of the turret of the tank having Brad Pitt wallpaper, his body is resting peacefully. He looks good. He is Brad Pitt after all. Looks like he passed away from embarrassment from being in such a horrible movie. Last guy covers him up. He gets rescued, medic says to him, ""you're a hero."" I think that was suppose to be meaningful, ironic or something. Its called ""Fury"" because thats the way I felt after spending $10.50 on it.",2014

I was sadly mistaken. This is just another one of those WWII films where a handful of heroic US soldiers take on and wipe out whole battalions of elite German troops in a totally unconvincing and ridiculous way. The action scenes are just not believable. Using a Sherman tank, not the best choice as they were known as a 'Ronsons' after the lighter, because they caught fire very easily, this sort of 'A' team' takes on hundreds of elite German troops. Their machine guns seem to have unlimited amounts of ammunition and the German troops having been surprised by the tank continue to run around like headless chickens for ages allowing themselves to be mown down by the score. There were many impossibilities and inaccuracies in the action scenes, but by golly it must have made the American audiences back home in the US puff out their chests and feel great! This film adds nothing to understanding WWII and it's horrors and I just don't understand why it was made at all other than to make shareholders a profit. Basically this sort of garbage should never have made it to the big screen or small screen for that matter, it should have been quietly left to rot in some dark corner or better still put on a spacecraft and blasted off into outer space where a million years from now some unfortunate alien might stumble upon it!",2017

I think the writers made a big basic writing mistake: The main characters weren't likable(OK, I kind of liked the ""new guy"" character). They were jerks and bullies and immature acting and I ended up cheering for the Germans hoping they would kill them. And also, one of the main battles was just plain goofy. There were like 200 German soldiers trying to take out one tank, but there were waves of them running in front of the tank one way, then later another wave was running the other way with no real purpose. It looked really stupid. I actually started laughing because they looked like the Keystone Kops. It is just a really bad movie all around with very unlikable characters.",2015
2,"It is hard to put into words just how loathsome a movie 'Fury' is. The self hating writer/director must have correctly calculated that any WWII veteran of the European Theater must be in his or her's late eighties by now, thus avoiding the real potential of one of them slapping the living scheisse out of him for this atrocity. It begins with a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German soldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our anti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for opportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts American soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs. See: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially after 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie following, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that.

According to them, Hitler didn't declare total war until April 1945, not in Feb 1943. Credit for showing the personalised detail of the tank, inside and out, where each crew stows gear etc differently from other crews. Well done there! However, on the inside there is a collection of medals that have been taken as trophies. Fair enough you'd think. Except there is a Mothers Cross as well! As if any mum would be walking around Germany in late '44 or'45 actually wearing her Mothers Cross! Even if by some chance there was such a mother, are we to believe Brad would strip it off the body of a (presumably) dead women as a trophy? From memory there was also an EK2 on ribbon in the tank, they weren't worn with the ribbon attached, so where did he find that Troy wonders? These are very simple things to research, blunders like this do not and should not happen. ",2015
1,"As a military enthusiast, this kind of Bull**** war movie is a f****** contempt of my intelligent. The director obviously played too much War of Tank, he can't hide his stupidities and ignorance by borrowed the only movable tiger tank from England. There were two reason which kept me in the theater. Firstly, I was expecting the tiger which showed up until the last 30min of the movie, after a total disappointment， I told myself 2 tanks play hide-and-seek is F****** bull**** enough, there are only 30 min left, there couldn't be anything worst than that. However the last theme which is the theme that the Fury killed a whole company of Germans proved that I overestimate the director's intelligent and underestimate my ability of endurance. The second reason is that I don't want to upset my friend who dress in US army suit sat right beside me. I don't understand why people give this movie 8 or 9 stars, everyone sane men can tell this movie is a f****** garbage from whatever perspectives. To watch this movie at cinema is a total waste of time and money",2014

4,"Well, I had high hopes for this movie. I had awaited it's release and enjoyed the build up... hearing that Shia Lebouff didn't wash for weeks in order to get into role; much to the annoyance of the other cast members... ",2014
4,"I really wanted to like Fury. The director talked about how he wanted to be accurate, how he consulted with veterans, got the only still functional Tiger and so on. Well, he couldn't fail harder.",2014
9,"Nice start. This is a very solid drama with a great cast. Still dealing with a situation from a case 2 years earlier Bosch the hard boiled, but seemingly very together homicide detective spends every free minute he can get back on the job whether he is allowed to or not. The pilot is very good, it has a Low Winter sun vibe, but less dirty cop-ish, and all LA. The supporting cast are mostly veterans, and even some child actors you may recognize. All in I found that I Enjoyed this first take, and hope that the show continues right where it is, I can see very little that could need improving. I recommend this to anyone who likes the realistic shows like True Detective, and Banshee. Not so much action, but the heart is there.",2014
10,"As a huge fan of Michael Connelly's Bosch books, I was looking forward to seeing this pilot and I wasn't disappointed. Titus Welliver is the perfect Bosch, the rest of the cast are just as brilliant and the writing and production are both spot on. The story line is in fact two Bosch books woven into one and it has been done very cleverly. Bosch fans have been waiting for twenty years for this character to be put onto film but for me, it was worth the wait. I would dearly love to see this made into a complete series. Titus Welliver is as brilliant as always and has the tormented look behind his eyes that any Bosch fan would expect to see. He may not physically resemble Harry but that is soon forgotten. Watch, enjoy, rate and share!",2014
10,"while eagerly anticipating this show's pilot (and hoping it would be anywhere near as good as Michael Connelly's excellent Harry Bosch novels), frankly i just couldn't imagine who could ever come close to portraying Bosch as i have always pictured him. until Titus Welliver. he is SO incredibly adept and believable at being (as opposed to playing) Bosch, it's uncanny. while i always pictured this character (one of my all time favorite recurring characters...in any books), i never could come up with an actor who i felt would embody all that is Bosch - the quiet intensity, the mannerisms, the looks, the presence and attitude. but, it's all there in this wonderful adaptation of MC's fantastic novels. it feels like the books, with the perfect gritty LA vibe, and i felt like it was Bosch's house come to life. i sincerely hope this becomes a series - if the pilot is any indication of what's in store. it's an excellent show - great acting, cinematography, directing, etc... i was not even slightly disappointed - and Michael Connelly's Bosch books have long been on top of my short list of all-time favorites!",2014
10,"Michael Connelly's Bosch series is one of my favorites. I was thrilled to hear that it was being made into a TV series and was hoping it would live up to the books. I loved the first episode and was not disappointed. Titus Welliver did an excellent job of portraying Bosch. Jamie Hector is cast as his partner, Jerry Edgar, and I think he was very good too. It is very surreal to see your favorite book character come to life in film and I was not sure if a television show could evoke the same feeling as the book. I think the first episode did capture the feelings from the book. Even if you have not read the books, this show would definitely appeal to any crime show fan! When the episode ended, I was wishing there was another episode so I could see what happens - which is funny since I read the books! Great casting, suspense, mystery! Watch it!",2014
10,"Just loved this gritty start adapting Michael Connolly's crime series with Harry Bosch as the central character. Acting is great and can't wait to see his characters and stories transferred to the silver screen. Titus Welliver, who plays an LAPD homicide detective, is just the right choice of actor that one imagines when reading Connelly's books, he could have stepped right off the page! The scene settings around LA make me want to go back and visit all the places i missed on my holiday there! My only criticism of this pilot is that stories from 3 books were used to weave into one story about a serial killer. One book can stand on its own but I understand the logic of immediately trying to capture the audience in this pilot. I really recommend this series to viewers who enjoy a good who ""dunnit!""",2014
9,"I have loved the books for many years now, I was both excited and worried when I heard that they were producing a series based off of Connelly's work. I happy to say that I am not disappointed. I am so glad that they cast Titus Welliver as Harry, he has been one of my favorite character actors and he brings the intensity needed to be a convincing Bosch. I was also delighted to see Lance Reddick and Alan Rosenberg in the cast. In fact the whole cast is impressive, congrats to the casting agent - good job! What a delight to find the familiar names from the book given faces. ",2014
10,"This is a great beginning to, what will hopefully be, a long running series. Although I would like to see this series picked up by prime time TV, I would gladly log on to Amazon to watch it every week. Check it out, enjoy, then give it a review. The Bosch series of books is extremely well written. So much so that I could always see the action happening in my mind. This series is long overdue. The characters are perfect, the lighting, scenes, acting....all of it is exactly the way is should be for the Bosch series. Keep the series going. Log on, watch, review. Bosch is great. IMDb needs to get rid of this 10 line minimum....what if I just wanted to write ""Watch Bosch!""??",2014
10,"This pilot episode of Bosch delivers on every level, with an array of top-notch actors, a tightly written script, and believable yet visually appealing backdrops. Titus Welliver's nuanced acting brings to life Michael Connelly's title character, infusing him with equal parts determination, intelligence, and vulnerability. Welliver inhabits the character of Bosch as if he had played him for years, and every gesture and bit of dialog rings true. Welliver is perfectly cast and destined for a long star-turn in this role. Because the writing is crisp and the cinematic quality directing spot-on, every scene fits together and moves at just the right pace. This is online television at its best. My only disappointment was realizing I couldn't watch the next episode yet.",2014
10,"Gotta remember that what we all are reviewing now is a pilot and pilots have specific missions: to set up genre, mood & character",2014
8,"I have been a long time fan of Michael Connelly and have read most of the Harry Bosch novels as well as the Mickey Haller and Jack McElvoy novels that features him. For the most part, the casting was pretty good although I pictures Bosch as a bit bigger and a bit younger. The attitude was captured quite well with the exception that in the books, Harry uses much less profanity. Harry Bosch is a gritty, seasoned detective that skirts on the edge of what is acceptable and what would be off limits in his investigations. The series seems to have started to develop this character and I hope it continues. They certainly captured his house as I pictured it from the books. ",2014
9,"This pilot is so perfectly moody. The Bosch character has a wonderful somber tone to him. The hour is reminiscent of the Jesse Stone movies. Its not a depressed show but it is rather adult, not a cookie-cutter cop show. There are wonderful nods to the books in this episode.The locations are great, as well as the way most of the characters interact with one-another. It takes me back to Hunter and the great outside the box approach that character had, along with the brilliant way LA was shot. A show like this hasn't been around in quite some time. Hopefully it will get picked up and we'll get to see a great progression to the person of Harry Bosch. Also, a jazz theme and title sequence would add to this already well-crafted piece of business.",2014
9,"The feel of the books was captured. I am happy with Titus playing Bosch, he nailed it. Good job on his house on the hill looking down on LA and keeping true to his love of jazz. Great background music. In the books, Harry does not drop the ""F"" bomb like you are doing in this episode. I hope that quits because Michael Connolly wrote with many more words and expressions other than the repeated use of the bomb. Good stories do not need to be inundated with vulgarity. Yes, he did use it on occasion, but only on occasion. Some of the dialog was low and difficult to follow so I will have to watch it again. I read both books, The Concrete Blonde and City of Bones and I am fascinated that the pilot should be a combination of the stories. I am assuming that should the series continue then they will fork off and get more into depth. Each story was very good, especially The Concrete Blonde. I like the idea that Michael Connolly is hands-on with this production so the integrity of his books is maintained. Like I stated earlier, I think the writers can deliver more dialog without resorting to vulgarity so much. I realize that these are cops and the language can get rough, but Connolly gets the toughness across without the constant use of vulgarity. Sorry if I keep on that same theme, but honestly, that is my biggest complaint for the pilot. Otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.",2014
2,What else have all these 10/10 reviewers been watching? Teletubbies? Plot is thin. Dialogue is predictable. Characters have been done to death.,2015
6,"This rating is for this season only. Overall I'd say out of all the cop dramas out there, this is top shelf. Which is why I was so let down this season. There's a really arrogant sloppiness to Season Three, as if all the writers and editors were given pay cuts or all the good ones have moved on. The editing is horrible; scenes are held longer than the actors can stay in character. Too many of the lines are throwaways and laughably predictable. There are huge, careless flaws in the story lines; where was the glass that Gunn would have used? and when everyone -- including Harry -- knew the glass with his prints was a plant, why did no one backtrack Bosch's barhopping steps and match the glass to the bar? Someone rummages through Bosch's place and after he misidentifies who did it, he just lets the matter drop? This in storyline big on fingerprinting. And come on writers' room, the guy who kills Sharkey is a shark hunter? You don't think too highly of your audience when you pull stupid stunts like that. It's as if no one involved wanted to take Season 3 seriously. A major exception is the casting of Bridger Zadina, a breakout star with a huge future. Jamie Hector clearly proved himself as an artist in his rendition of Marlo Stanfield, but his role in Bosch is made completely superficial and stereotypical. He likes fine suits, a Cadillac, has a smart kid, and is loyal to Harry; there's nothing else to know about Jerry. NO chemistry between Bosch and the prosecutor he's dating. There's way more chemistry between the funky bartender with the nearly shaved head and Robertson, and they only have minor interaction. Lance Redick needs to get himself a role as someone other than a rising police chief because he's given very little to do here, although he does bring a snack with him to his son's grave. Bosch is an Amazon Original series, not some cheap production on the USA channel. If they'd paid as much attention to detail as they did to product placement, this could have been a must-see-TV season, but instead this season borders on a joke. Maybe it's because I loved the first two seasons and had such high expectations but I feel confident saying if this was the first season it wouldn't be picked up for a second season.",2017
8,"Perhaps one of the best detective dramas on TV, not just Amazon. Season one started a bit slow but if you sit through the first 2-3 episodes you see excellent acting and very good story lines.",2017
4,"I've read every one of Michael Connelly's Bosch books, enjoyed them, and eagerly awaited the next. I assume Titus Welliver is playing the character of Harry Bosch as written in the script, so I'm not commenting on his acting. I've not seen him in anything else. But this Harry is a cold, hostile, angry individual without much to recommend him, and not the guy I've followed and empathized with in the books. This Harry seems like the prototypical hard-ass, mean LA cop, devoid of humanity and compassion despite his terrible childhood. He occasionally shows a dollop of feeling (other than anger) in service to the story, but turns it off immediately and hoists the enormous chip back onto his shoulder. My Harry swears far less than I do, but not this guy. His girlfriends are too young for him and too perfect and I see no reason that they would be attracted to this dour dude in the first place. Maybe somewhere, but not in LA. I'll keep reading, but not sure about the watching. Not sure whom I have misjudged--Michael Connolly or Harry Bosch. It's like the bumper sticker says, ""mean people suck"".",2017
9,"Gritty. Dramatic. Emotional. A bit of realism and of course that Hollywood liberties they take. While not a huge jazz fan I can say the jazz soundtrack is perfect for this show. I'm bog on shows and movies that apply that right music for the back drop. It sometimes acts like another character. In this case it definitely does. while I can just say what a great actor and perfect fit for Titus Weaver to get a major starring role as the title character, I really liked to say that just about each and every actor pays their character with convincing emotion. They must all push each other to be better actors on set. This is better than most cop movies and network shows out there by far. Highly recommend!",2017
7,"Despite all the product placements, the detective who loses out on a random bidding site somehow not named Ebay (because bidding in e-commerce sucks), despite the played-out DA entanglements, city politicking and wise-ass coroner character who only has one dead body to deal with at a time (always offering advice); despite the typical precocious teenager who regularly sneers and rolls her eyes, the slow talks about crucial evidence without interruption, a detective with a wardrobe of $800 suits, a producer with an incredibly overblown take on modern relationships; the constant headshots and knifings; the cruelty and blood and whores of which Bosch and Co. must deal with every day of their working lives; despite that murder cases miraculously come to a head in a week when serialized; and despite that, in the real world, a cop like Bosch would be dead and fired by day 5, it's my favorite show these days. I just wish it didn't make me roll my eyes sometimes.",2017
3,"I am a big fan of the books, and I really liked Seasons 1 and 2. I am not a big fan of Season 3. There were too many things going on, and none of it was particularly engaging. I am surprised that Michael Connelly, as a co-producer of this show, would allow this script to get by him. Please make Season 4 better.",2017

3,"I have never written a review before, but was so disappointed with this season that I felt like I had to. I watched seasons 1 & 2 and really liked them. I hated this season. Every single character was one dimensional -- from the facial expressions to the complete lack of chemistry. The writing & direction was horrible. Will not be tuning into season 4.",2017
5,This show has them all. I'll just list my favorites:,2016
2,"IMDb has 1199 user ratings and 1 written review. Riiiight. Flooding your own show with positive reviews is one way of doing things, I guess. Another might have been hiring talented writers. The dialogue is wooden. The lead character is playing a boring conglomerate of every rogue cop you've ever seen and none of the supporting characters are given anything to do. This is a poor mans csi and although it's shot beautifully that's about all I can say for it. Titus welliver is a good actor, but he must have cringed at some of this dialogue. I would hope that amazon keeps trying in this field, but they should find an honest way of getting reviews out to prime members.",2014
5,"I'm giving this a 5 for season 3 only - seasons 1 & 2 were solid 8s. I can't recall if the Bosch character has become more miserable but he is definitely someone with a real attitude problem in this season. It makes him quite unlikable at times. Why did they give his daughter such a prominent role? Fast forward each time she's in a scene. No criticism of the actress whatsoever, just didn't sit right for me. Each of the other main characters also had major family issues this season. It did take much of the plot line, was it padding to stretch it to 10 episodes? I will watch season 4 if only to see if people's comments have been heard and they decide to bring the writing back to the high standard of the first two seasons. I really liked Titus Wellivir's character in Lost and I think he makes a great Bosch but I wish they would tone down his negativity just a touch. A bit more, perhaps black, humor would give the character some badly needed depth. Not blaming Wellivir at all but Michael Connelly must take some of the blame for making the TV Bosch character so one note.",2017
7,"After the many scathing reviews, I went to this film with very mixed feelings. I certainly didn't expect serious Sci-Fi – after all, I had seen the trailers – but I actually wasn't quite sure what to expect (and I'm not sure I would have gone to see it at all, If it hadn't been directed by Luc Besson). Well, maybe it's just because I expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. 'Lucy' delivers a fast paced, crazy ride from start to finish, and I'm frankly a bit shocked so many people seem to hate this film with so much passion. Hadn't they seen the trailers? I thought it was clear from the get-go that this film was first and foremost meant as entertainment (and it certainly doesn't pretend to be the new '2001').",2014

5,"People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false.

4,"Disappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The situation the main character found herself in had an array of extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in. If you're a fan of logical ""what ifs"" like myself I would not recommend it.",2014
10,"F*** this IMDb rating. I haven't been this entertained in 90 minutes since Pan's Labyrinth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets 8 stars, and everyone is attacking the science of this film... f*** off. This movie is fantastically cool.",2015
3,Scarlett Johansson proves beyond a doubt that she is able to carry the lead actress role in this sci-fi action flick. The camera work and narrative ambiance starts off marvelously. But around twenty minutes into the movie everything starts falling apart as relentless and repetitive force-feeding of pseudo-scientific and underdeveloped philosophical gibberish is applied in a sad attempt to legitimize the developing story line. If you manage to swallow the entirety these factual misnomers you may suffer from having no education or sense of rational thought and may also be eligible to blissfully enjoy the ensuing turn of events. ,2014
8,"Check the genre of this movie, it says SCI-FI, which stands for science FICTION!! If I watched every sci-fi movie expecting it to correlate with real life physics then there would be no point of the genre. All these bad reviewers seem to be on the more intelligent end of the pole but isn't cognitive enough to realize they're NOT watching a documentary!!!! This is a good sci-fi movie, which kind of lets you imagine what you could do if you knew everything and could do anything. Obviously It's not possible because you would have to break the laws of physics to even get near that point but it's still good to wonder. Worth a watch if you like the genre.",2014
8,"I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their humanity and become real Gods.",2014
8,"Lucy is a spectacularly ridiculous but very entertaining film which is the best one Luc Besson has directed in a long time... even though, considering all the missteps he has had since he returned from ""retirement"" 9 years ago, that isn't a big compliment. For better or for worse, Lucy employs Besson's habitual style, combining abundant action, a creative visual style and an accelerated rhythm which, in this case, distract us from the parade of nonsense and inconsistencies from the screenplay (Hasn't the ""we only use 10% of our brain"" myth already been discarded?). Fortunately, this film counts with solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who brings charisma and credibility. Morgan Freeman brings his usual conviction, serene presence and persuasive voice, while Choi Min-sik and Nicolas Phongpheth bring quite a personality to their villain roles. Besides, with only 89 minutes of running time, Lucy ends as quickly as it began, it never gets boring at all and it leaves us with some philosophical reflections I found interesting. Lucy is not a great film, but it entertained me very much, and I recommend it as a pleasant distraction which doesn't require us to pay too much attention. And besides of that, I like to see Besson back on the right track in his career as a director.",2014
1,"This movie is terrible, plain and simple. It starts out as a fun action movie set in Taiwan. Scarjo is in some really cool scenes and is acting amazingly. This is cut with shots of Morgan Freeman having a stroke and blabbering one-liners about life that wouldn't impress Jaden Smith.",2014
9,"Normally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from what people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion. Because of the bad reviews I didn't expect anything at all. In fact, I expected a killer heroine who would beat her adversaries to pulp. However, I got an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold. So if you don't break into tears because the movie operates on ridiculous scientific premises, watch it and have fun. It's different, it's interesting and its extremely entertaining.",2014

But everything that could possible go wrong, goes wrong here. ",2014
1,"Stupid. The antithesis of what the movie purports. The final line ""Life was given to us . . . now you know what to do with it."" Yeah. Don't waste your time on this spew. Remember Altered States and all the philosophical claptrap they put forth as plot and dialog? This is worse. First the premise that we only 10% of our brains is BS. We use it all. The 10% is nonsense that you can debunk on Snopes. Understand that the writers didn't even go there for their information and didn't even bother to read Wikipedia on this concept and you now know how weak this is. Steer clear, folks. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING to see here. Even the special effects are bad, low grade CG. Morgan, you've fallen a looong way since Shawshank.",2014

At the beginning, I thought that perhaps it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. However, as it progressed the storyline became more and more fascinating. In my opinion this film had the perfect balance of realism and sci-fi. Some of the effects were of course slightly questionable... but I cannot really complain because the overall brilliance of this film outshone any negatives I could detect.",2014

LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY.

Throughout the first season and going into the second one everything changed. I had to force myself to finish watching the last couple of episodes of Season 2. It all turned into a soap opera, with 79% nonsensical drama elements, absurd plot, tormenting action and atrocious acting. Too bad another what could have been a great show, turned out to be a boring lemon. The worst part is that they are considering making Season 3 ...",2015

No proper explanation or rationale on why the hell a good, understanding kid in season 1 goes crazy from the very first episode of season 2. You can speculate from the first episode of season 2 that the kid will turn out to be a villain which is honestly some real bad writing. A kid OK with all the weird stuff his mom doing, befriending a infected kid and OK with it despite telling a back story that the infected kid was blind is just garbage of a writing just to show us that the boy is turning to dark side. The kid exploding the bomb himself was kind of hilarious and at the same time reaching the heights of some real desperate writing. This series just went to some laughable show containing cool horror features, people with blades, guns cutting and blowing the infected people and that's it. No proper story line, lots of loopholes and please keep a nearby window open while you watch this because you literally have to throw logic out of the window while watching this. I bet season 4 will be bringing us into a post nuclear phase of new york city with some fallout(game) like environment and some more weird creatures roaming around (of course because of the nuclear blast). This had a good plot in the beginning and that's it. The simple way to describe this series is ""ITS BAD & NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR TIME"".",2016

At first the characters was very caution treating with infected ones because a single drop of infected blood could contagious them, but suddenly they starts massacres without any caution. infected blood are everywhere and no one cares. In the other hand these people with professions like doctors or hackers become killing machines and have ninja movements within days... In fact they are even more effective with a sword that fully equipped Navy Seals. Another example of the stupid evolution from the characters is the Dr. Goodweather's son. This nice and good kid turns so evil in a matter of days that he use a nuclear device in the center of NY killing millions. At this point the only reason why I'm still watching this show is just because i like a couple of characters and I want to know how the story ends...",2016

This shows characters are some of the DUMBEST characters ever. Even starting in the first episode. So many stupid plot holes and absolutely make no sense plot lines. So many people doing stupid things it just gets to be to annoying. Early on I was yelling at TV, Please eat that stupid person. I wanted everyone to die, quickly, for being so stupid. Just a few stupid things: Why would the coroner pick up the beating, moving, diseased heart?! The stupid girl doctor Nora is at the autopsy of the pilot, she sees his anatomy has been drastically changed and he tries to eat them with abnormal tongue ...but then when they are at the little girl's house, she freaks out when the old guy chops her head off, stating stupid stuff like 'we heal our patients, WHAT!! These have to be the laziest vampires ever! There are hundreds of vamps in the sewers BUT THEY Don't COME OUT AT NIGHT, REALLY?! And the characters reactions to finally seeing the creatures is NO ONE CALLS ANYONE, NO COPS, NO FBI! They just walk around like nothing is happening. The surviors from the first episode, they start having symptoms but NONE of them calls a doctor? Why does an all powerful vampire have to hire thugs for simple errands? The coffin...The vampire could lift, carry the coffin but had to have it driven out? From what we see of how the vamps feed, it makes no sense how the vampire attacked all the passengers on the plane with no one noticing... I could go on and on, but what's the point. The screen play must have been written by 5 year olds because no intelligent grown person with common sense would have wrote/directed this stupid of a series.",2015
7,"An interesting show with potential, but it's still too early for the jury to render a verdict. The cliché characters could be it's undoing. The writers need to stop insulting the intelligence of their audience and do their homework. As indicated by other reviewers, the CDC would never handle a biological threat in such an off-handed casual manner. And would anybody really believe they would allow a single corner to undertake the autopsies of an entire plane of dead passengers? We get it's science fiction but please don't insult the intelligence of the audience with such blatant plot flaws. This show has the potential to be another Walking Dead, but if the sloppy writing continues it will just be plain dead. My finger are crossed with hopes of some better writing to follow.",2014

2,"Well the first few episodes really showed promise and apart from a few bits of bad scripting really made me think we finally had a good show to watch. But from ep4 everything changed, the story and acting just failed in so many ways, e.g. the devout Christian wife of an infected passenger decides out of the blue that it's fine to feed her neighbour to her infected husband for complaining about the noise, WTF? ",2014
6,"I like Del Torro's work so I was anticipating this show for some time. It started off strong, good concept, different take on things & I enjoyed maybe the first half of the season. The effects were good for TV. Then it became cheesy & super predictable. The acting from some of the cast was barely mediocre. The boy/son was hard to watch, he came off bratty & not a great actor (sorry, I know he's a kid) The ending, I won't spoil but was disappointing for a season finale. I highly doubt I will tune in for season 2 when there are so many other, better put together shows available like The Knick or Penny Dreadful. The best story line was about the old man when he was younger but that was it. Sorry, not a fan.",2014
5,"6 episodes in, and this isn't good.",2014
7,The pilot looked very promising and it just started getting better and better. The story is very nice and the effects are quite good for cable television.,2014
8,The Strain after the first episode has definitely persuaded me to watch the next episode with it's frightening but complex storyline and thrilling pace. The basic idea of the show without giving away any spoilers is that the CDC is working to solve a virus that is quite basically the weirdest thing anyone has ever seen. The bodies all appear to have no markings or bruisings or anything wrong with them other than a strange color and the smell of ammonia. They all appear to be dead but are they really?,2014
3,Update 2: 08/25/2015 Just finished about 4~5 episodes from season 2 yesterday. I can hardly describe my feeling now.,2014
1,"At least the vampires are somewhat intelligent. All the non-vamps are so flawed and stupid (especially Em's son - what a spoiled, vindictive, ignorant brat). The main character, who by all accounts is some kind of brilliant scientist (I guess that may be true during the times he is not enabling his wretched son, guzzling hard liquor, or making stupid decisions), but all evidence points to not likely. And has New York experienced this mass infection and murders while most of the remaining people who are not infected remain completely ignorant? I guess I don't understand the government's blasé attitude toward this whole (very implausible) situation. I know this is all leading up to some kind of final battle, but frankly, I don't really care about any of these characters any more and am sort of rooting for the vamps. Survival of the fittest. The humans on this show are doomed.",2015
10,I'll start off by saying that this series compelled me to create an IMDb account.,2017
6,"Not expecting TWD or GOT quality TV here, some cheesy acting, smaller budget...aside from the leads bad wig for a few seasons...I had to write a review about the kid...the one who blew up New York city because he loved his mommy?..and now plays video games and brats it up while the world has gone to hell (thanks to him)..does no one in production or higher up say ""we need to get a good actor or kill off this character, this kid has been stinking up the show for 4 seasons now""....they could get a better actor at any high school production within 50 miles.",2017
7,"Just finished Season 3. When I started the show, I could not stop watching it. And now, when Season 3 is done, they are still not any closer to getting the bad guys or finding a solution to the vampire problem. I mean, come on. How many times do you have to kill a single person to stop making him come back? (Kind of reminds me of Hindi serials). And the characters need to be a bit deeper and better liked in these kind of shows, where you are heading towards a post-apocalyptic world. I hope they wrap it up in Season 4.",2017
4,"I have always loved vampire stories, and so I was very intrigued by the premise, rather a cross between 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' meets 'Underworld'. This series never lived up to the hype, but it was interesting for the first little while. There has to be some suspension of disbelief involved (unless you believe in vampires?). What rapidly becomes apparent is that the logic chasm just keeps opening wider and wider. All of the main characters do things that are so incredibly stupid that you start to actively dislike them. I watched through to 13, in the vain hope it would get better. It doesn't. :P ",2015
1,"I won't make this a long review. That would being giving this mess way too much credit. What started as an interesting premise, has quickly degenerated into a wandering, sloppy, stupid mess full of nonsensical ideas and plot holes big enough to fit the moon. The writing is atrocious, the acting sub par especially the annoying kid, the sfx were about the only good thing going for it. But the really silly and illogical things done like, the government only using 200 nation guard troops to defend New York against the vampire horde, people seemingly oblivious to vampires killing hundreds if not thousands off every night, and the lists goes on endlessly. Perhaps though the worst was the ending of season 3. ***Spoiler Alert***Dumb kid detonates nuke cause??? And our protagonist gang looks dead on straight at the explosion a mile away without suffering flash blindness, radiation poisoning, blast and debris damage to themselves? No really! They all get up and walk away without a scratch. Wow! There's not enough suspension of disbelief to cover-up that crappy writing. I'm done.",2017
4,"There I was, watching what looked like a innovative slant on the Dracula myth when Wham! the plot and script descended into blandness and stupidity. Characters stupidity quotient increased with every episode resulting in the inevitable ""let's rely on hope to cure our infected friend from turning into a blood sucking monster"", ""let's run through a group of monsters with 10 foot long mouth-parts cos we probably won't get bitten"", ""let's hide in the dark basement cos they've never got monsters in them"", ""let's leave a stupid kid with the IQ of a turnip in charge of an adult with dementia"" and of course ""lets whine and bitch like teenagers when hunting monsters cos they won't hear us coming"". I got to episode eleven before the nausea became too much and I had to turn it off halfway, lest I puke!",2014
9,Soooo...,2014
9,"The affair is a deliberately slow- paced,beautifully shot,compelling show. The 2 main characters recount their truth in regards of the forming of ""the affair"" with a crime mystery in the background as an excuse to do so . We, as viewers,must decide and deduct our truth from their accounts. I love the psychological aspect of this show. In fact it's the main reason for my watching. How a very same event is viewed and felt and told differently from the people who experienced it.If you enjoy this show, I would recommend you also read ""The One"" by Vivienne Harris-Scott. The premise is nearly the same: what happens when 2 people fall in love when they should not.Each chapter is told from one person's Pov as Alison and Noah's, and it is as compelling to read, if not more,as there is also a suspense element. In fact, I had Déjà- vu when watching the first 3 episodes!Anyhow, with this as with H.Levi's "" in treatment "" Showtime has hit the jackpot. A mature and sophisticated audience will thoroughly enjoy this.",2014
10,"Love this series, the way the episodes play out showing both sides of the story from two different perspectives is brilliant. The acting is superb! Ruth Wilson won best actress award for her character in this show, and well deserved! I only wish Dominic West had also won, although he was nominated! Anyone who gives this series a bad review simply does not understand great writing! It's very intriguing to see how two sides to the same story are similar, yes, but very different at the same time! I thought I would just like the show and maybe watch it ""On Demand"" when nothing else was on, but I love this show and can not wait to see what the writers have planned for season 2!",2015
10,"I troubled myself to understand the thing that makes this show so seductive, so different. To discover what is the ingredient that creators ably slipped into this immensely emotional and sensual potion. Something that imbues this show to its firm core. After a long consideration, I realized, that this one thing I was looking for is nonexistent. Because this show in its entirety is that special thing. The combination of intriguing, complex characters, empathy that they draw from the viewers. Mystery, that so elegantly dances through the plot, while hypnotizing us to follow its perfectly composed, unpredictable step. Casual, compelling, conversations that silently pull you even deeper down this beautifully directed world. By telling this story through the eyes of the characters, we find out that their view of the same situations vary. Not only that they see or understand something through their psychological state, this multi-character experience exposes us to realization that each person is living a life as vivid and complex as our own. This would be impossible to achieve if not the breathtaking actors and actresses that catapult this show to another dimension, yet never more close to humanity, to now, to us.",2017
7,"I thought Id give this a try and was thoroughly impressed. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I won't spoil it for anyone, but if you like an intriguing and dynamic drama with complex characters and a storyline that keeps you on your toes, then give The Affair a try. The writing is clever and the direction makes what could be an average drama about a love affair into a real page turner. Thank god it's on Showtime because the Networks would tank this show if they had the chance. Well do Showtime for picking this up. Ruth Wilson is incredible in her role. Check her out in Luther as well. She is so well cast in her role as Allison, as is Dominic West who knocked it of the park in The Wire. I love that Showtime has chosen a couple of Brits for this American drama. Right now, this is the show I look forward to most each week, just as I did for Game of Thrones when is was on and that's saying something!",2014
5,"I would have given Season 1 a ""9"" and Season 2 a ""6"", but since I gave Season 3 a ""1"", that averages out to a 5 or thereabouts. Season 1 was gripping and compelling because of the passion between the two characters, and the suspense of what would happen to them and their families, etc. Season 2 was still intriguing since the characters' lives were so out of control and, of course, there was a mystery to be solved. I'm mainly writing this review after watching Season 3 because I feel there are some ""serious"" questions left unanswered and I assume there is NOT going to be a Season 4. I just can't imagine what the writers could possibly come up with since ""the affair"" itself is long over and they've given a semblance of closure to a number of things at the end of Episode 10 in Season 3. However - now ""Here Come the Spoilers!"" - Season 3 has many episodes depicting Noah in prison, being taunted, abused, bullied and physically attacked by this guard named John Gunther, who he knew as a boy in high school. John Gunther supposedly was jealous of Noah's swimming skills back then and the fact that Noah made it out of their small town in PA and the fact that Noah went to college and made something of himself. So now, in prison, we are to believe that Gunther is extracting some kind of revenge on Noah. He injures Noah's shoulder so badly that Noah is prescribed Vicodin for the pain and subsequently becomes addicted. After prison, Noah notices Gunther following him and ultimately Noah is stabbed in his University housing and nearly dies. We can only assume that Gunther is the culprit. Later Gunther tries to run Noah off the road. But Noah is having a rough time and he's also hearing things and is becoming unstable. He goes to Gunther's house to confront him and Gunther disables him, but doesn't hurt him, as we would expect. Gunther also acts as though this is the first time he has seen Noah in 30 years. He appears to be a pretty decent guy who is just trying to live his life and take care of his wife and autistic son. Later we realize that Noah has imagined everything about Gunther and that Gunther was not the guy who stabbed him. Noah did that to himself. So here's a question: If everything we were shown about Gunther in prison was in Noah's mind, then how did Noah hurt his shoulder? Or was his shoulder even hurt at all? But if his shoulder wasn't hurt, then WHO originally wrote him a prescription for Vicodin that got him addicted in the first place - because that was not fake. He was definitely taking prescription drugs and somebody must have written the Rx. Another question: In the scene at the lake house, his neighbors tell him that property out there is NOT selling at all. They've been trying to sell their place for a long time and no one is buying. Noah is broke. So how does he have the money to suddenly pack up and go to Paris, rent an apartment and live for several months (Paris rents are astronomical) with no job. Are we to assume that Noah's father's place sold immediately when his neighbor's property wouldn't sell for months, if not a year? His father's place was a dump, so at best it would only be worth what a lot would be worth. But in ending this review - I just have to say that Season 3 was absolutely ""agonizing"" to sit through. My husband and I did sit through it, hoping each episode would get better, but they never did.",2017
9,"Strictly from a man's perspective, who has gone through an affair, I really like the way this series is heading. To me, the subject matter is not anything we have'nt seen before, but the way the story is being told is just brilliant. To use both versions of the events that take place is presented in a way that does'nt seem repetitive. We do however in episode 4 see how both versions of the affair become similar and the story continues to move forward. What does kind of get lost is this so-called murder investigation, which I'm sure will become more apparent as the series continues. I believe what captivates me the most is the stellar performances by the actors. You can honestly feel the chemistry between them and that's what separates this series from others with a similar subject matter. But, in the end, and I've experienced it, nothing good ever comes about from an affair.",2014
7,"The theme has been done to death, but this time prepare to be pleasantly surprised, for the execution of this short series is quite good and features not only lust but also the characters' psychological descent as influenced by loss, poor communication, and bad parenting. ",2015
8,I have only seen the first episode. The show was split into two halves; first from the male's perspective and second from the female's perspective recalling the same events. I can only assume by the title the two lead characters have an affair at some point. ,2014
4,"I really have to ask myself why I stuck it out through two entire seasons of this dreck. That's 24 frikkin episodes of slooooow close ups of puzzled faces looking at one another with strange intensity while tinkly piano music is echoing in the background, making every glance seem filled with ominous foreboding. ",2016
10,"The Affair is one of the few recent productions on TV which deals with the hard psychology of man woman relations and its myriad entanglements. An affair between two married people is largely a narrative device through which the series explore what drives men and women to seek out risk, love, chaos and meaning throwing all the comforts of a ""settled"" life to the bin. Though there is a moralistic angle to it, but its kept at the sidelines with the primary focus being the psychological subtleties of love and betrayal. One can say that the series is heavily driven by pitch- perfect reactions of characters to each other and the ambiguity of desire. Jealousy and possessiveness haunts the characters in the initial part of the story where an affair, quite necessarily is creating new avenues for the intensity of desire to gush forth. There are lives being left behind in the promise of a better one and the collateral damage to the once dear. Season 1 is concerned with the question of carnality as a means to feel alive again. The greatness of the story lies in its astute understanding that men and women are similar in some ways and different in many others. Desire is the self trying to complete itself through another but men and women understand completeness differently many times and this creates timeless problems between them. ",2015
7,"I think the premise is promising and the pilot was solid. It's split into two parts, from the perspectives of each of the future adulterers, who have markedly different recollections of the same events.",2014
8,"Been watching ""The Affair"" this fall on Showtime and I must say it's one hot new series that keeps you on the edge of your seat as each episode is told in two half like ways. And you get a different take on events and happenings from each of the main two characters Noah and Alison and each episode shows happenings thru flashbacks all centered around the hot intimate affair of Noah and Alison, all of this is centered around a hidden possible murder mystery. The tale is set one summer with Noah(Dominic West)a writer and teacher who decides to take his children and wife Helen(Maura Tierney)to the Hamptons and stay for a get away vacation at his in-laws' estate island. Soon upon arrival Noah meets Alison(Ruth Wilson)a married local waitress who's lived in the area all of her life. Right off the two hit and soon a hot and intimate lust affair of sex and sleeping around happens with these two. Both of these characters Noah and Alison have baggage and burned pasts with skeletons in their closets as Alison has pain and a tragedy still she is one hot sexy lady that looks good wearing colored bras!(look for Ruth Wilson to be a hot new star) Overall this series is a fun treat that let's the viewer escape showing what it's like to have an affair as many of us have fairy tale wishes of an affair just like this one.",2014
8,"This series is meant to keep viewers hanging on. I like that. We're witnessing a train wreck. I can't stop looking, waiting for the outcome. Like any train wreck, there are eye witnesses with differing accounts of the events leading up to the aftermath of the event. Alison and Noah are providing their perceptions of the wreck and collateral damage. The train hasn't stopped screeching toward halting to a stop. The debris field isn't complete. The Affair is a piece that makes you observe and think. I don't find it all that entertaining. Those reviews that are complaints are looking to be entertained. Asking why are the characters doing this or that...IT'S A STORY. FICTION. A WRITER'S STORY. It may also hit a nerve for viewers who've had an affair or contemplated one. Art imitating life?",2014
3,"Nothing is worse than an affair without ""commitment. The leads in this show who are consumed with cheating on their spouses to fulfil some unknown reasons only privy to themselves, spend more time questioning their behaviors than indulging in them. This leaves the watcher to question exactly what they are watching... Are they more interested in insuring that they can appease their own consciences with rationalization of their actions, or as in many scenes they appear to be constantly looking for a way out, most likely due to the fact their relationship seems to make no sense at all? They don't seem to care about displays of public affection in what is a small town, where everyone knows each other's business, there is no accountability to spouses or children as to their whereabouts, they have wanton disregard for the other's feelings and there is constant dramatic tension within the confines of their sexual relationship, as they seem to be having second thoughts mid orgasm. Thus, the lack of commitment, originality, and completely filled with cliché that accompanies any affair. The premise of them telling their story two different ways to a detective investigating a murder which is again is cliché filler, and for what unknown reason written into the story line, is an interesting premise however, but gets old just four episodes in. How the writers will fill in another dozen episodes should be interesting. Please write something to keep our attention!",2014
4,"Season one ran its course and I saw it through. It was OK. I didn't quite see why it had garnered such respect but it was OK. As with all dramas these days they can't be just ordinary people embarking on an affair, like many ordinary people do. Instead there has to be tragedy in the mix. For me this made it less compelling. But the real trouble for me came with season two. Now we had extra voices telling the story, so there were even more angles, even more interpretations. I started to see the funny side: in series 8 we might get the point of view of the garage mechanic who services the family car. The Affair was actually over with now - Noah and his wife were separated and Noah and Alison were together - so the title is no longer apt. And, like all series seem to these days, in an effort to extend the success and further the profits, the story gets more and more bloated and sillier and sillier. I can only think the makers think that an audience, once hooked, will swallow anything. The final episode of season 2 is riddled with ludicrous coincidences, such as everywhere Noah and Alison go they seem to bump into former family members. But the denouement takes the biscuit. Standing at the road side Alison and Scott have a confrontation, and it is clear to the viewer what is on his mind. They talk for minutes without a vehicle passing. He then makes a grab for her and she pushes him. He steps back into the road and, lo, a car sweeps passed and kills him. That's hard enough to swallow, but to then tell us that it is Noah's car and Noah's ex-wife is driving. What are the chances? I'm still hoping for a grown-up program some day.",2016
2,"So I feel pretty foolish now after wasting my time watching this whole season. After loving McNulty in The Wire I was tricked into thinking this series was going somewhere. So I think the whole first season could have been condensed into 2 episodes. The idea of showing two points of view doesn't make much sense when in some episodes it was the exact same events that occurred but just the characters wore different clothes. The acting is good, but the story stinks! We had a murder, great, we have an affair taking place, great, but where was the suspense all season ? Showing various escapades of the main characters without tying them into a specific plot line or circumstance of importance, like the murder say, makes no sense. The sex, the flirting, the romance, why do these scenes not tie into something bigger ? After a full season I am ready to give up..I wish I came to this conclusion sooner. Reruns of other shows would have been a better investment of my time...sorry McNulty..your new show is a Dud !!",2015
1,"This is so poorly written. It reminds me of one of those bad novels from the 1970's and 80's. If you took every cliché in those and mixed in a little Lifetime Channel, you would get this. Corny, tired plot lines combine with stock characters to the effect of little more than a soap opera set in a summer vacation locale. At one point one of the characters says, ""Everyone has one good book in them."" I hope they didn't think that this was it. ",2014
6,"Lots of promising plot lines. Majorly aiming at women, hence my disappointment because I got a little more than bored when the crime mystery took a back seat to steamy love scenes and jealous wives. Young woman with little prospects falls for narcissistic writer with 4 kids and a wealthy wife he lives off. That could have been a classic and I did enjoy the first 10 episodes until it was mostly the misunderstood writer and his hot waitress girlfriend getting into long dialogue about commitment. Half way season 2 instead of a criminal court case its custody battles. Too much Days Of Our Lives and too little Twin Peaks or The Bridge or what have you, where a small town is the back drop for insidious crimes and secrets. This is not it. Ps: when we hear parts of his books, he is more of a cheap romance novel writer than literature. Very unbelievable.",2015
5,"We loved this show -- until we came to the extraordinarily clunky ending to Season 1. The acting is simply brilliant. All the major characters have depth. And the exploration of memory and its vagaries is wildly engaging. We thought we were watching the birth of a new t.v. classic -- something that could stand up alongside great shows like ""Breaking Bad"" or ""The Wire.""",2015
8,To previous uptight reviewer...go back to your crap hole country and watch god propaganda all day. some of us can actually watch shows that don't agree with our values and still appreciate the entertainment value. I noticed how offended you are by the affair itself but not about the person murdered..... twisted sense of priorities. I find this show..thought provoking. Maybe one should think of all the things that could go wrong if you have an affair that's why I have no problem with the show being on TV it can be used as a learning tool at least something to make people think. I Beli eve lessons c an be learned while also watching something of interest.,2014
3,"I have a very mixed feeling after watching the first episode. Hopefully it will develop to the interesting direction so I am not crossing it yet. However I find the first episode rather boring. The action is very slow and nostalgic. Showing the two perspectives of the man and women makes it interesting as you are trying to understand why there are such differences, who's version is real or if this is just an option from the author so you can choose whatever you want. The affair subject - well nothing sophisticated and unnecessarily extended erotic scenes make me wonder if the author really has anything more to say or just relies on belief that such scenes will make this plot interesting. For now rating just 3 .",2015
3,"I watched the first episode and I wonder why it is so highly rated here. Probably because 20 people who rated it so high were the only ones who watched it to the end and the rest just turned it off after first 10 minutes because it is so boring and didn't bother to write a review. It is indeed beautifully shot, has some nice views but the pace is so slow like in the soap operas of the 80-90's. Also each episode consists of 2 parts: the same events shown by the eyes of both sides. It's pretty weird that in his version the waitress was seducing him but in hers it's the other way around. But it only makes it longer. The plot is banal: he is tired parent of a big family hoping to have some fun with local waitress while on vacation. Main characters are not very likable. He has 4 annoying kids and doesn't seem to have any fun in his family apart from having sex with his wife when it's not interrupted by their kids. The question is why have so many kids when they all hate each other? Especially when he can't afford it which makes their family dependent on his wife's father. It's so stupid. Don't they know about contraception? Looks like this way script writers tried to justify the affair. I guess if he had only 2 kids it wouldn't be so easy. She is 31 years old local waitress. She is depressed and it shows. Looks like she is about to cry all the time. It's hard to believe someone rather picky would fall in love with her on the spot. Why trade one tired woman (wife) for another? There was a girl in the beginning in the swimming pool flirting with him. She was beautiful and cheerful. It would be more believable if he had fallen in love with her then. The series has a lot of sex disgusting sex scenes. I think idea in it to show that average looking middle aged people also have sex.",2015
5,"The series is well acted. The previews promised a sexy drama, but the more I watch it, the less I care how it turns out. Analyzing why this drama hasn't mesmerized me the way others have, here is my critique:",2014
2,"This third season has totally lost all credibility and seems to be stringing us along with sex,hallucinations and nightmares. I was taught at school that to write essays and make them dreams was not acceptable and a cop out. Well obviously the writers did not have such good English teachers. How many times can the characters switch sex partners and still be likable? They are having to resort to scandalous behaviour which is not acceptable and believable. I have lost all interest in this series and feel quite upset that it did not keep up a good standard of writing. Will not be watching the final episodes and any future series. As a further insult the Summary of episode 7 reads as follows:-",2017

10,"The only reason I can think that people are so down on this show is that they are The Walking Dead fans and they're upset because now there is a much livelier, scarier, gorier and more violent version of it. Unlike TWD Z Nations has a keen sense of humor. Some of the one liners are simply hilarious. In the second episode, while entering a gas refinery that is swarming with the undead, one of the characters sighs, ""Fracking Zombies."" It's moments like this that gives Z Nation a certain energy that TWD doesn't have, since TWD takes itself all too seriously. Z Nation is to TWD what Sunny in Philadelphia is to Seinfeld. It's like TWD on crack. Just two episodes into it and already there has been some very memorable and horrific scenes, like the infant baby zombie in the first episode or the zombies covered in black oil in the second. Finally Asylum, known for such quirky low budget flicks as Sharknado, is doing something solid. I'm a fan. I will be watching it every week.",2014
9,"i don't know whats wrong with people here,have you ever watched an original old zombie movie? z-nation is much closer to the real deal than TWD. i liked it pretty much and i know i wasn't the only one. i don't know if people getting paid to write bad reviews , but i assume ,yes -- the acting is how it supposed to be,and again,just watch some old zombie movies to compare. its a good cast,too.It is easy to remember the characters. The story is funny and it has some new ideas ,which TWD couldn't pull of.i was surprised that is was a scyfy series,i thought it was fx. :-( overall a nice series,hope for many seasons despite that paid trolling.Just watch it instead of just writing bad reviews cause you think thats the wave to float with. :-)",2014

9,"I think the problem here is that everyone is comparing this show to the Walking Dead, which in my opinion, has failed the zombie genre. The first two episodes of this show had me on the edge of my seat and the graphics were quite good (obviously not HBO good). The zombies in the show are terrifying and yes some of the acting is a bit stiff but its SYFY, they do have a budget, and they're spending it on the right thing, graphics. Almost non-stop action is what propels the show and a new ""smart zombie"" spin is whats going to keep me watching. Im tired of watching zombies get speared through the holes of a fence, it's time to let the humans be the hunted! I highly recommend you give this show a try because in my opinion they're doing almost everything right and it could be one of the most thrilling shows to grace the airwaves in a while.",2014
9,"It's a great show. Trying to save the world by keeping a jerk alive and getting him to California.The jerk is really good at being a jerk... Some of the lines the actors are given are a bit cheesy and the timing is sometimes a bit off at times between guest characters speeches. I think the dialog writing could be a bit more natural. I really like D J Qualls. He's a doll. His scene looking for people from the bite mark project to get back to him was great. Being from Canada I love the Northern Light station scenes. I like the young couple and the older gentleman. They are pretty cool and good actors. The leaders of the band are very good as well. Since so far 10,000 hasn't been in much it's hard to tell. Over all I think this show is very entertaining and I'm hoping it continues to be so. There are some unexpected surprises in the show and that is good - like the oil tank. What did Citizen Z name the dog by the way?",2014

1,"If you're a fan of The Walking Dead or good television, this is not for you! A funny scene where they are about to shoot ""Nanna"" and one of the girls singing jumps before the sound of the gunshot, this pretty much makes you realise what to expect and how bad this is.",2014
9,Title says it all imho.,2014
4,"Those two words sum it up. Unlike The Walking Dead, this series features the kind of zombies who can run, jump, and even create simple ambushes. Outnumbering human survivors by several thousands to one (at least they present it as so), there is no plausible way to explain ANYONE's survival three years into the infection. That's why the show reverts to cheap thrills, such as bringing a character into a hopeless situation every five minutes, only to be rescued by someone's incredibly precise shot in the zombie's head. Besides, while survivors' naivety is a regular thing in zombie movies during the EARLY stages of zombie infection, there is nothing to explain stupid moves of ""Z Nation"" characters THREE YEARS into the infection (SPOILER: for example, a very stupid decision to return to a room with a zombie baby, which has cost the first episode's main protagonist his life).",2014
3,"SyFy and Asylum, that's a crap fest and we're all well aware of it going in. No hiding it. When Harold Perrineau shows up I'm like OK cool maybe this won't be so bad, he's a really good actor. Maybe they are going to spend some money on this thing.",2014
10,"This show is awesome, the zombies are active and fast and they run unlike the walkers in TWD, and this one has a vaccine already unlike TWD, and besides TWD, which other horror TV show is being aired in these recent years... Come on guys isn't home boring already for us to backbite and underrate this show...I think we can have both shows and enjoy because running zombies alone is enough to make this show and intense enough to keep people glued to their seats. The show has an advantage of great humor and comedy attached looking at the cheeky and funny lines from Murphy, Doc and Ten Thousand... The name in itself is funny... TWD hardly has humor which makes it all rigid yet no one complains... Duuuuuh let's support the show and take jealousy out of the way... It's a classic and I would watch it and watch TWD also... Go #ZNation...",2014
4,"Anyone expecting a real competition between this and The Walking Dead will be disappointed. This is nowhere near as good as TWD. I saw the trailer, so I kinda knew what to expect. The trailer is honest, and it was a true representation of what you should expect. This is a poor man's interpretation of TWD. There's very little character development, at least in the pilot. I understand they can't do that much development in a 42 minute episode, but they didn't even try. Instead, they relied more on zombies here, zombie there, zombies zombies everywhere. If you're more into Dawn of the Dead type characterization, where they introduce a character, give very little background, then this will be right up your alley.",2014

8,"I love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 (which remains iconic) and I usually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of the feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new interpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots, drones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war propaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I liked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the human devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha gives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.",2014
7,"Is the reviewer writing the review the IMDb member is reading -- or is the member reading the review he was looking for, regardless of the text actually used? I ask because clearly that sort of thinking, that sort of dialog, was near and dear to the writer of this oddball film, yet, paradoxically, it is this very strangeness that gives the film historical worth, and the chance (however slim) that it may be remembered fondly by viewers of the the far future.",2015
4,"**SPOILERS** I'll start this review by making it clear that the original Robocop is my personal favourite movie and has been since I first saw it 25 years ago. Having felt much trepidation about the direction the remake was going in (PG-13 rating in particular) I went in with fairly low expectations but still something of an open mind as I really wanted this reboot to faithfully kick-start a new, successful Robocop franchise. ",2014
7,"By 7, it really means a 7.5/10. Not sure what's with the negative reviews, but I enjoyed the movie very much. It's well-executed and the direction was clear and crisp. There's no distinct feel-good actions scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see why there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat, it's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story precisely for the moralistic themes it explores.",2014
5,"Okay, so very few people were confident about this remake. The original has such a huge fan base that a reboot seems like blasphemy to most.",2014
10,"Full disclosure: the original Robocop is among my top 5 favorite films of all time, and I've easily watched it over 200 times. With that being said, I still looked forward to this re-interpretation due to my love of the character (whose legacy had already been profoundly tarnished by the redundant first sequel and catastrophically misguided second sequel) and my admiration of director Jose Padilha's ""Elite Squad"" films (as well as his documentaries). Suffice to say, I came into the theater with a bias toward wanting the film to succeed.",2014
8,"The new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining sci-fi action  thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the  humanity side of Murphy, the main character who eventually becomes the  titled cyborg law enforcer. The film ultimately wins for not trying to  be the original (1987 version). The story of Murphy is similar (since  it's a remake) but does its own thing to provide something new instead  of retelling the same thing again. The film focuses more on the  development of Murphy's character, his initial response to his cyborg  body and relationship with his family, making the character more  emotional and relatable to the audience.  The film delves into the meaning of humanity, family themes, media  influence on public opinion, corporate greed (capitalism),  authoritarianism and corrupt law enforcement authorities. It provides a  brief view of the struggles we might face with machines or digital  surveillance of the future. It also briefly raises the question whether  it's ethical or legal to eliminate the human factor in law enforcement  to reduce crime rates by creating merciless cyborgs or robots to  replace humans.  The action sequences are updated with a higher body count, with better  CGI and sound effects, making them cooler, stylish and more  entertaining than the original. The new black tactical design of  Robocop is found to be acceptable and nice...the updated Robocop is  more agile, flexible and stronger compared to the original. However, I  personally find the right human hand to be slightly distracting. (I  prefer no human hand at all, entirely machine except the face)  There's quite a lot of credible actors in this film: Abbie Cornish, Jay  Baruchel, James Earle Haley, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Samuel L.  Jackson all providing decent performances to this remake. Although it's  hardly a ground-breaking film or a masterpiece, Robocop is a decent and  satisfying remake that delivers on many levels. There's currently no  plot problems, inconsistencies or plot holes found in this film at this  time of writing this review. So, it's good enough for a recommendation  to watch it.  Rating: 7.5/10",2014
1,"Before I went to go see it, I already knew it couldn't compete with the original. But this actually was worse than I expected. What was great about the original just like Terminator is that it was grimy, dark and although robot cops offcourse aren't that realistic they we're not beyond belief.",2014
8,"I just don't see, why any other recent science fiction movie deserves more respect than this one. The story is fluent, the characters are well built, everyone has its own motive. Yes film is more of a personal struggle journey of the main character and that is what I like. For the fans of action it is also good, why when (quite often) there is, it is good one. The effects are quality mastership. The most memorable scene is when Murphy sees what he has become.For my regards it has some philosophical connotation to, because it also concerns the influence of technology to the society. It clearly shows bads and goods. I recommend watching this movie for",2014
5,"With Hollywood at a loss to make original movies, it was inevitable that the Robocop franchise would eventually get the reboot. In 1987, the original Robocop became an instant box office hit with its mixture of witty satire and over the top violence as well as top notch acting by Peter Weller, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox; the deciding factor in what made that movie so fresh at the time was the addition of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who seemed to understand what the audience at the time needed: a high tech cyborg (artfully designed by special effects whiz Rob Bottin and its robotic suit would become a cinema icon) who fought crime in a near future world overwhelmed by greed, hypocrisy, corruption and excessive, almost cartoonish violence.",2014
1,"I really am shocked at how rubbish this was. I had high hopes from the average score here. I was pleased when I heard the original theme tune at the beginning, leading me to expect other loyalties to the original. Then, nothing, no loyalties to the original, or the comics. However, I am good at getting over such things, I can treat new remakes as Individual films. I have to say though that they just didn't do very well here at all. Most of the film was contained to the subject of his development, more so his combat mode, where by his cyborg side killed so many targets in so many seconds. It seemed to me that they made this film to make video games as that is all the story line seemed to revolve around. I am sorry as I really thought it might have been a good one.",2014

4,"I'm a fan of the original 'RoboCop' movie  I find it to be fun,  satirical, enjoyably violent and overall very good. Naturally, I wasn't  very thrilled when I heard it was getting a remake. I was even less  thrilled when I heard the remake will be rated PG-13. I mean  how can  you make a 'RoboCop' movie without excessive violence and blood squibs?  Now that I have seen the movie, I can freely say that the PG-13 rating  is the least of this movie's problems. Initially, I didn't want to  compare the remake to the original, I wanted to view it and review it  as a stand-alone movie. Now that I have seen it, I think I'll have to  compare the two movies after all, since the remake possesses none of  the qualities that made the original such a classic, and by simple  comparison I can easily explain why the remake is an utterly flawed and  ridiculous movie.  The movie opens with a political show, called the Novak Element, led by  the host Pat Novak (Samuel L. Jackson), during which we see a news  footage of OmniCorp droids (including the famous ED-209 and the freshly  introduced humanoid drones called ED-208) patrolling and inspecting the  streets of some Islamic state. Novak compliments the droids and then  starts attacking The Dreyfuss Act  a law that forbids the deployment  of such drones in the USA. We are then introduced to Raymond Sellars  (Michael Keaton), the CEO of OmniCorp, who is trying to find ways of  tricking The Dreyfuss Act and start deploying his products in the USA.  He gets the idea of incorporating both man and machine into an ultimate  law enforcement product. We are then introduced to our protagonist   Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman)  who is soon heavily injured in an  explosion and is used as a guinea pig in this newest OmniCorp program.  Like I said before: the 'RoboCop' remake lacks everything that was good  in the original movie. First of all, there's no worthy satire in the  movie. Society is sometimes mocked through the character of Pat Novak,  but the satire isn't very subtle nor intelligent  actually, I'd say it  is very primitive and expeditionary. Second of all, the nature of  Robocop's character is very different from the original movie; he's not  a robot, but more a man in a robotic suit, and his family plays a  fairly big role in the movie. And I would be perfectly fine with these  changes if the main actor, Joel Kinnaman, didn't have the charisma of a  paper bag and could, as a matter of fact, act (!), and if Abbie Cornish  (who plays the role of Alex Murphy's wife  Clara Murphy) wasn't so  irritatingly bland. The revelation of the RoboCop suit and the suit  itself were also poorly done. In one scene, Michael Keaton's character  criticizes the suit design that appeared in the original movie by  saying something along these lines: the original suit wasn't tactical  enough. Well, at least the original suit didn't look like a black  dildo!  The villains in the movie didn't get a much better treatment, either.  Among the several villains that appeared in the movie, none was  memorable or even remotely interesting. But, to be fair, not everything  sucks about the 'RoboCop' remake. Some of the acting was OK (mostly by  experienced actors like Jackson, Keaton and Oldman) and the special  effects did look really good. But what's the use of awesome special  effects when the majority of the movie's boring and tedious? Add to all  the aforementioned flaws the PG-13 rating, which destroyed the  potential of some scenes, and you'll get one weak and forgettable  movie. In the original, one of the most memorable lines goes 'I'd buy  that for a dollar'. In addition to butchering everything else, the  remake also butchered this line. In one scene, Jackie Earle Haley's  character Mattox bashes the concept of Robocop saying he 'wouldn't buy  that for a dollar'. As for myself, if I knew upon purchasing my ticket  what horrors were awaiting, I wouldn't have bought it for a dollar.  Rating: 4/10",2014
2,"ROBOCOP (2014) is the latest in a LONG list of remakes/reboots that have come in droves in the 21st century. For the most part, modern remakes just simply do not work, and this film is no exception. The first strike against them is the seeming requirement that they have to be PG-13, when the original was most probably R in the 80s, and I can even remember a few PG-13 movies back in the day that pushed the envelope more so than anything now! The original 1987 version of Robocop was a lightning-in-a-bottle classic, a perfect amalgamation of action, sci-fi, horror, satire, and drama. Sometimes, a film works simply because it doesn't TRY to be anything more than entertaining and everything else just comes together. I think that the problem with this 2014 version is that it TRIED to be different to the point that it focused so much on what it was trying to be, that it forgot that movies are meant at their core to simply entertain.",2014
1,"This is a disgrace to the original, at the time it was a groundbreaking and very shocking film, with great actors very original and well done ideas and such an original style to it, well this crap is exactly the opposite, terrible story line, very slow to start I would go as far as saying boring, and for the actors in it got to give it to the director the whole film is just all terrible acting, the overall very bad crime feel in Detroit doesn't come across, where are the crazy adverts, where is the infamous bad guy, and the setup to murphys story? All missing, why mess with the story line from the original which was excellent anyway, this is nothing short of an epic fail, it just manages to scrap 1 star rating as robos HUD view is quite cool but that is literally the only good thing I have to say, I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a film, please director don't do any more films, a complete waste of what could of been a brilliant opportunity",2014

It is decent, heart-warming, and one you look forward to seeing on a weekly basis, just like shows from the 70's and 80's. My family and I have gotten to the point that the only television series we enjoy watching is by purchasing DVD's of shows from the past like the ""Waltons"", ""Little House on the Prarie"", or ""Anne of Green Gables"" and watching them for hour long entertainment.

10,"I am officially a When Calls the Heart addict! I can't get enough. I watch nearly everything on the Hallmark Channel, so last fall when they showed the movie that starred Stephen Amell and Maggie Grace I, of course, watched it & fell in love! I then got all of the books by Janette Oke & read them practically without putting them down! (Yes, I do work & it really interfered! LOL) I eagerly anticipated the series as they advertised it for what seemed like forever. This is a series that has struck a chord in my heart that's long been unfulfilled. I have always been a fan of Little House on the Prairie, The Walton's and the Love Comes Softly series. I wish I lived in those times when life was much more simple and people really did love their neighbor. This new series, When Calls the Heart, is what I've been wanting for a long time - good family programming that I don't have to censor or watch it when others aren't around because I'm ashamed of it's content. This is a time when men were chivalrous, women were strong and children did as they were told out of respect for their elders. It's such a nice change from what we see on other programs that are on right now. I'm praying that Hallmark & other channels realize that there are people out there longing for this kind of programming. I'll be so heartbroken if this doesn't get a second season. So, for now, I'm loving me some clean romance between the pretty schoolteacher Elizabeth & the handsome gentleman, Jack. Love that smile & the red Mountie jacket! Loving Lori Laughlin too - she's always been great!",2014

Our children learn some history in it along the way as well. How many children 7 and under do you hear playing using the term ""Constable""????? Oh yes our children use that term regularly now!

Wonderful writing.. great acting...We love all the characters. How cool to make an episode dealing with Dyslexia. My child was diagnosed a year ago and thought that was great to see Miss Thatcher helping her student! We love Jack !! We love Abigail and all the cast. Great costumes and scenery. My daughters (10yrs) favorite scene was when Elizabeth called Jack her guinea pig!! My 13 year old loves it when Jack takes care of the bad guy. Mine is any time Jack walks into the scene. :) Thank you! Please continue with more seasons!,2014

Though the lead in the series are different from the TV movie , I adored the young Elizabeth Thatcher and Mountie Edward. I didn't think I would fall in love with the series...but I did. Based on Janette Oke's novel (Where courage calls) , the series is about Elizabeth Thatcher who leaves behind her wealthy background to travel to coal valley to be a teacher. The town that is grieving a recent coal mining accident leaving many of her pupil orphan. While she teaches her pupil life teaches lessons to her. How she embraces her new community and works for them is inspiring...and then there is the Handsome Mounty Jack Thornton...sweet romance. ",2014

6,"I never watch Hallmark shows / movies. Usually they are just to schmaltzy. But I always try. This one caught my eye and has kept it. Right from the start it has a modern vibe to it.

3,"I dearly loved this show last year (season 1). I have been following the show since the pilot movie. Of course, there were cast changes from the pilot movie to season 1 but the changes were easily acceptable. Season 1 really succeeded in portraying the daily struggles of a small town overcoming a huge tragedy. Everything seemed pretty cohesive and believable as a period drama goes. This season, I was excited Hope Valley had a new mission with the lumber industry. But, sadly, I am disappointed with many changes this season. First of all, does anyone know where Elizabeth's friend, Cat, is? Also, where are the row houses? Why are the ladies' hairstyles so different from last season? They look very modern. The costumes seem too uptight and fancy for living in a small town. Most of the women are wearing full makeup that just doesn't match the era. Even Jack was wearing blue jeans in one scene. The show is supposed to center around Elizabeth's career and love life. Where are the students and their families? I thought the new church/school would open up some story lines about her teaching adventures and so far nothing has happened. Has anyone heard if the writing/directing team has changed? I really want to see this show succeed but am worried the quality has really slipped. It seems really ""cheesy"" this year with no depth.",2015

Each week I look forward to watching; I do not have to worry about the language or what my grandchildren might see watching the show in the same room. Children today need the principles modeled by the characters in the story. The people of Coal Valley have undergone unbelievable tragedy and they have been forced to endure incredible hardships. Their faith in God, their perseverance, their neighbors, help them survive. I enjoy the period pieces and old westerns. The Hallmark Channel has a real gem in this series, I hope that they realize the impact that this show is having on so many people.

It's so disappointing they ruined the atmosphere of the frontier town.",2017
10,"When Calls the Heart is a fantastic show with good family values. It has plenty of interest for both adults and children! No need to worry about lunging for the remote on this show. It is a show with old-fashioned values that make it like-able entwined with the modern style of film making and Hallmark's trademark style. Our whole family enjoys watching the show, and I know of other families who do the same. It's really great to be able to enjoy clean entertainment on the level of Little House on the Prairie, Gunsmoke, and other shows of a similar type on prime time TV each week. The actors do a very good job with their parts, making everything quite believable! Love WCTH! Hoping for a season 2 for starters, then many more to come.",2014

Sure it may not be the drama that you see on TV each night, but that's one of the nicest parts, it's not trashy, or filled with smut. There is romance and mystery, heartbreak and triumphs. Each week I look forward to the newest challenge these characters face. This show has created such a following on social media, and everyone is counting down the days until the next episode... Sad to see this season end, but really hoping we have additional seasons to look forward to!! #Heartie for life!",2014

But the characters can't. The characters are just not very smart. The dialogue is pretentious. The set design for the period setting is not convincing. The whole thing comes across as fake and contrived. This isn't a show that was created to be wholesome. This is a show that was created to be as inoffensive and facile as possible. Elizabeth could have been the new Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, but comes across more like a dimwitted granddaughter. Wholesome doesn't mean stupid, but this show's creators apparently missed that memo.",2016
5,I came across this when scrolling through channels and was confused which time period it was set in. Not until I saw the cars did I realise it was set in the early 1900s.,2015
10,"One of the shows I'm looking forward to, this year. The costumes look grand, the sets look fantastic and a promising cast. Together they seem to create this feel of authenticity of greater times, classic times. It's unbelievable how I was convinced by just the working stills and screen shots of the show available here at IMDb. I love history and it is only natural for me to like ""When Calls The Heart"" as it is based on another time. To be honest, it was an accident that I found this show because I was looking for Johannah Newmarch's work/filmography and bumped onto this show at the hallmark channel website I think. And I'm oh so glad that I did. Not only Johannah Newmarch, the cast includes a lot of lovely actresses as well. Cannot wait to watch!",2014
3,"While I do not expect a Hallmark series to be an intellectual treatise, I still expect it to be consistent to its time period. When Calls The Heart treats its era fast and loose, existing completely outside of reality yet it presents itself as if it were a historical dramady. The teacher presents poetry that had not yet been classified as of any literary importance, while the same poet is quoted by persons who would hardly have heard of an obscure writer. An actress sings a song she supposedly sang when she fell in love over a year previously, when it was not written until three years after her current place in time. The costuming is plucked solely out of imagination, as are the hairstyles and sets. If the plots were compelling, I would suspend my criticisms of the anachronisms, but they are often silly and the characters actions are rarely propelled by realistic motivations. If you like the Harlequin style of romance, with a preachy bent, and you do not expect to think during a drama, then this is the show for you.",2014
10,"I am really impressed by this show. It is refreshing to see something on TV that shows wholesome, traditional values. The cast do well together. The writers do a great job of story telling. I am really hoping that Hallmark takes a listen to what the fans are saying and gives the green light for a second season. Michael Landon and Brian Bird should be proud of what they have started with this show. Daniel Lissing, Erin Krakow, Lori Loughlin and the rest of the cast including the children are amazing to watch. It is definitely a good old fashioned romance. The backdrops and scenery are breathtaking. Brian Bird and Michael Landon Jr. capture the time period accurately, without making it seem contrived or hokey. It is a great example of how a community can come together in the face of tragedy and learn how to be a new type of family. In a world that is so negative and depressing, When Calls the Heart is a breath of fresh air. The romance is refreshing. You can sweep a person off their feet without necessarily involving sex. This show proves that. Great Job! Looking forward to Season 2 and beyond!",2014
10,"Hallmark Channel has delivered another exceptional series! When Calls the Heart is a wonderful show for the whole family. I have never been so interested in a series in all my life. I am sad that the season finale has come and gone, but I have hope for a second season. I promise you will not be disappointed in this series. The show is about overcoming hardship and unthinkable tragedy as well as love and romance and about friendship and community. The actors do a magnificent job and really pull you in and make you feel like you are right there with them. Please give the show a chance and you will be hooked just like I was.",2014
4,"Season 1 was pretty solid, but season 2 has so many distractions. The hair, make-up, and wardrobe is terribly wrong for the time. The set looks wrong for the story's premise--it's too clean. The dialogue is far too modern. Some of the secondary characters are beyond cheesy, like Rosemary and Julie. The plot has way too many complications--it's like a soap opera. The Jack-and-Elizabeth romance is so sluggish and involves so many triangles that the viewer loses interest. Some anachronisms from season 1 are relatively easy to get past, like the flashlights that obviously used LEDs, Elizabeth's familiarity with dyslexia, and the use of the song ""You Made Me Love You."" I can even get over how little cooking is going on in the café, considering Abigail is basically the only cook. It's a real shame, since this could have been a good show similar to ""Christy."" But season 2 is unbearable. I won't be continuing with this show.",2016
10,"It is refreshing to see such values in a series! Hallmark, you are upholding a standard that should be praised! Thank you for producing such a wonderful show! I can't get enough of this story-line and the actors/actresses!! They have touch my heart with courage, commitment, tenderness and values! YEAH!!! I love the bantering that exists between Jack and Elizabeth! They make me blush and giggle all at the same time! Refreshing to see the development of this special bond between the two of them! Would love to see the relationships between the other characters evolve!SO many great sub stories!! So delighted to be able to recommend this series to my daughters and Grand daughters! Thank you!",2014
9,"With a heavy heart, I downgrade the show from a 10 to a 9, because they have recently introduced two instance of foul language. I can only assume that more is coming. It does nothing to enhance the show and makes no sense to me why they would do it. For people who care about these things, be aware. I know that a lot of people don't mind this sort of thing.",2014
3,"I do like the fact that this is a clean, family show. And if you like formulaic writing along with drama by recipe, you'll really enjoy this. I managed to get through the first two seasons, suffered through the third season opener and finally had had enough. It's too bad because the settings are excellent, the period is wonderful, but there was enough sap in this show to make to give me a sugar buzz.",2016
10,"I have always found everything Steve Pemberton and Reece Sheersmith have written and performed in together total mesmerising. Their stories are highly original and imaginative. All their characters are thoroughly amusing, sometimes poignant and usually down right odd! I love stories with a twist, and so far the tales in this series have not disappointed, they get you thinking and are full of anticipation, Steve and Reece, please keep writing together! I loved The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville and this is well on par with that. They appear to be influenced by the horror genre and their individual episodes are reminiscent of The Twiighlight Zone only more sophisticated. Their acting is so convincing and they can easily portray all the crazy characters without going over the top. Supported by some well known faces, it is interesting to see the interaction between the actors. In my eyes these guys can do no wrong! Can't fault the series so far!",2014
10,"Absolutely, one of the best shows I've seen in years. The only show that has good twists that neither my girlfriend nor I ever see coming. Amazing dark British humor at its best. Needs to expand its fan base into the US and Canada even more. Put it on BBC America and/or one of the streaming services. Some of my favorite episodes are: 12 Days Of Christine, A Quiet Night In, Tom & Gerri, The Harrowing, The Trial Of Elizabeth Gadge, La Couchette. Hopefully, the show has many more seasons to come. I can say for sure that this is one of the few programs that truly leaves me shocked. At the end of many episodes, I am left staring at the screen, with my mouth agape. I really cannot get enough of this brilliant show! More people need to become as obsessed with this show as I have become!",2015
10,"This is the funniest half hour I have had watching TV for a long time , it started with slapstick ,turned to hilarious comedy with the two hapless burglars ,and then came the bedroom /bathroom scene ,this was worthy of the best of any of David Jason's scenes in Fools and Horses ,I had to pause the programme to wipe away the tears of laughter. No sooner had the hilarity ended then we had a moment of high drama followed by more comedy with the dumb salesman and then the grand finale which took me completely by surprise . The plot twisted and turned and was brilliantly written and acted . I can't wait for the next Inside No 9.",2014
9,"Inside No. 9 is the brain child of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the writer/actors party responsible for The League of Gentlemen, which I think is one of the best British TV comedies ever. With this new series, they retain the comedy with horror undercurrents basic idea but with each separate episode being a standalone teleplay. All stories occur in a place with the address no. 9. The format is such that the action in each instalment never moves from the one location. It reflects that these have been made on a pretty tight budget but despite this the writing is good and the cast does include several respected actors such as Katherine Parkinson, Denis Lawson and Gemma Arteton; Pemberton and Shearsmith themselves are of course brilliant character actors themselves and appear throughout the series too.",2014
9,"When asked if the Voyager space probe should carry an audio recording of J. S. Bach's music, Carl Sagan (or possibly Freeman Dyson) supposedly replied: ""That would just be showing off."" If we assume aliens have any concept of dark humour and visual storytelling, the same could be said about this series.",2015
8,"While I'm not a ""League of Gentlemen"" fan; I loved Reece's performance in ""A Field in England."" Therefore I was prepared to give ""No 9."" a go. This series has an impressive line up of guest stars from Katherine Parkinson to Tamsin Greig. Each episode is a mini-play set in a different location. I especially liked the creepy mansion in the final one. The stories contain twists, humour & horror. Only one of them (""The Last Gasp"") disappointed me. The make-up and costumes for Reece & Steve are great. ""Sardines"" has a terrific end to hook viewers in. ""A Quiet Night In"" is full of surprises. ""Tom & Gerri"", my favourite, is a compelling moral tale. ""The Understudy"" examines the price of success. ""The Harrowing"" is traditional horror with a scene stealing role for Reece. I look forward to a second series.",2014
9,But a lot better in many respects. With only one episode left this has been an interesting ride.,2014
10,"Inside No 9 is another creation from Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith who together had created Psychoville and were a huge part in creating The League of Gentlemen, two very good dark humour comedy shows with less then a decade between them and three years after Psychoville had ended Inside No 9 was born.",2017
10,"Yes, it is short, and yes, I don't think it's long enough to make me satisfied every time. This is a really good show if you just sit down, be patient, watch it, and think. Steve and Reece are my favorite and two of the most talented producers and writers I know. Really want to support this show. Don't make it stop.",2018
10,Plot twists seem to be a difficult thing to pull off well as they have a tendency to either be very predictable when done poorly - making continuing to watch feel pointless and the ending totally disappointing if you do continue after calling it so early - or they can just end up being so contrived and convoluted as to be completely ridiculous which feels equally as disappointing.,2017
8,"From the writers and creators of The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, when I heard the title I assumed it would be something to do with the house opposite No. 10 Downing Street, I could not be more wrong. Writers and stars Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton brought us another British series full of fantastic dark comedy, but this was not a sitcom or series of sketches, it is an anthology series. Each half hour episode focuses on a self-contained storyline with new characters and new settings, the stories are only linked by the fact that they take place at a number 9, e.g. house, flat, desk, dressing room, etc. Shearsmith or Pemberton, usually both, star in each episode, but each has a new cast, a number of well-known stars, these have included: 4.3.2.1.'s Ophelia Lovibond, The Musketeers' Luke Pasqualino, The IT Crowd's Katharine Parkinson, Four Weddings and a Funeral's Anna Chancellor, Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt, The Mother's Anne Reid, EastEnders' Timothy West, Nativity's Marc Wootton, Oona Chaplin (Charlie's granddaughter), Denis Lawson, Fonejacker's Kayvan Novak, Gemma Arterton, Tamsin Greig, Sophie Thompson, Dead Set's Adam Deacon, Skyfall's Helen McCrory, Mark Benton, Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh, Jack Whitehall, Sheridan Smith, Paul Kaye, Another Year's Ruth Sheen, David Warner, Jane Horrocks, Tony Way and Alison Steadman. Stories in the first series included: a game of Sardines that turns dark, bumbling burglars trying to steal a painting from a mansion, a homeless man stepping into the lives of a couple and changing dynamics, a celebrity dying at a little girl's birthday and his last ""valuable"" breath being held in a party balloon, an understudy actor doing whatever it takes to steal the leading role of Macbeth, and a young girl hired to house sit in a Gothic mansion with bumpy noises and a disabled family member ""not to be disturbed"". Stories in the second series included: a French sleeper carriage with passengers coming in and out and a dead body in a bunk bed, a young lady's life is mixed and unravelled following a car accident towards Christmas and New Year, a woman is put on trial in the 17th Century as she is accused of witchcraft, a man starts working for a helpline company called Comfort Support Line and gets some disturbing calls, a grandmother's 79th birthday party with a a large fake cake for hiding someone underneath brings out some embarrassing but also life changing home truths, and a TV personality sets up a séance with an actress playing a spiritualist medium to prank unsuspecting members of the public, only for it to turn dark. It is a fantastically written and performed show by Shearsmith and Pemberton, each episode is full of great jokes, dark and sinister or moving and dramatic moments, believable domestic and social situations that become unusual, strange, cringing or twisted, and you never know what to expect, a must see British dark comedy anthology. It was nominated the British Comedy Awards for Best New Comedy Programme and Best Comedy Drama. Very good!",2015
1,"I've seen funnier things come out of a cow's backside!! Monty Python was funny, Spike Milligan was funny, Fawlty Towers was funny...Even Benny Hill was funny. This pile of dog do's isn't funny at all. As far as comedy (among other genres) goes, the BBC have lost the plot. They seem to be making TV for dumb people to keep them dumb!!",2017
9,"At a glance, this show looks like your run of the mill wacky, raunchy adult cartoon comedy. And yes, it has plenty of that with the titular character's rude and obscene behavior, and a saturated slew of animal puns. There are wacky characters and absurd plots to be sure, but all of that eventually takes a backseat to the fact that Bojack Horseman is, at heart, a nuanced and overtly depressing show about pain and self-loathing.",2014
10,"I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.",2014
9,"Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come.",2014
8,I want more.,2014
8,"I've been a little bored with Netflix recently as there were few shows left to watch. Yesterday i noticed this on the homepage of Netflix, i clicked on it and i was instantly hooked! This series is very well animated, the voice acting is fantastic even though they do use some of the same actors twice. It's got a lot of good plots and good jokes and it's very enjoyable. If you enjoy shows like Family guy, Rick and Morty or Regular show i guarantee you'll like this. This is as icing on the cake a Netflix exclusive, so for once an animated show will only be available at Netflix, IT WAS ABOUT TIME, i really hope Netflix will continue this series and everyone with the time on their hands should really watch the hole series in a mind-blowing hilarious marathon like i did.",2014
8,"The opening of the show is a succinct depiction of the general feeling expressed in every episode. I have frankly been tiring of the increasing"" anti hero"" complex penetrating the mainstream surface. I am sick of being tricked into feeling sorry for asshole characters who create their own problems, probably because I, too, am an asshole, but I enjoyed this show. The contrast of the anti-hero in the character of BoJack to the every-hero in the character of Mr. Peanutbutter was interesting enough to keep me watching, and didn't leave me irritated.",2014
10,"Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise. ",2014
10,"I started watching this show with very low expectations, about ten minutes in I was hooked. Will Arnett is hilarious as usual. It reminds me of ""Daria"" and ""ugly Americans"", it is grounded and dark but funny nonetheless, I found myself watching the whole season in one day. If you enjoy Seth MacFarlane or south park type shows and expect something similar then this show will completely disappoint you, think more of arrested development meets ugly Americans, it's a grown up show, the writing is smart and may be boring to the simple-minded. But at least in my opinion it is excellent and refreshing, and I hope to see it go on for years.",2014
9,Bojack Horseman,2014
10,"When i first saw this show in the recommended list i tough it was just gonna be a regular comedy, but oh boy i was wrong. This show perfectly combines comedy and drama each of both elements standing out in certain episodes. As the show went on, Bojack the protagonist of this show started to grow on me, i started understanding what was going on trough his head that made him do the things he did in life, i started understanding his struggles, he is not just a meaningless cartoon character, it almost feels like he has a soul just like any real person person. The voice acting is terrific, no complaints there.",2017
10,"While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed. ",2016
10,"Where do I even begin with this show. Is it as good as everyone else is saying? Yes, yes, yes and yes. As a big fan of animation this show caught my eye my eye but I never got around to watching it because it looked like a generic animated sitcom. Since then I've loved many adult cartoons like Futurama, Rick and Morty, South Park, The Simpsons. But after I heard all the praise BoJack has been getting I decided to check y out. And I couldn't stop watching it. What begins a a typical satirical cartoon sitcom quickly becomes a dark, depressing and raw look at the celebrity business. But it's also a character study about a depressed washed up TV actor who hasn't regained his fame since the sitcom he starred in ended a long time ago. He is a complete asshole. He's the most unrelatable character you can imagine. At least, that's what you think at first. As the show progresses his character is given a lot of depth and relatability. And it hurts. You realize how broken every character is and how broken you might be as well. It's not a pleasant watch, but man is it excellently written. This is easily the best show on Netflix and if you haven't watched it yet do it as soon as possible. 10 /10 (if not a 9/10)",2016
8,When I initially read the summary of what the series was I was excited because of my love for 90's style cartoons and I thought that it was a strange enough concept that might just work. ,2014
10,"Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?",2017
9,"Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!!",2016
8,Several reviews I've read on BoJack Horseman indicated the show was out of date. The show fits in more with the height of the Adult Swim reign of animation and not the intelligent output of American Dad or Archer.,2014
10,I have never been rewarded more for sticking through the early episodes of a show than I have with BoJack.,2016
10,"On the outside, this show appears to be your typical silly cartoon based on the satire of modern Hollywood, but as you dive deeper, this seemingly hollow show is filled with deep themes based on our basic needs and wants as humans. Through the quick one liners, puns, and thought out jokes, this is a show about the choices we make in life. Shorterm goals vs longterm goals? Is it better to live life dumb and ignorant or aware and sad? The endless themes including family, true love, the definition of real happiness, are all hidden behind what seems to be just an alcoholic washed up celebrity. The show itself is a metaphor that nothing, and nobody, is what they appear to be at first glance. And finally, it poses a question to the audience: is it ever too late to change the path u have chosen to live?",2014
10,"I was apprehensive about watching this show, initially drawn in by the novelty of Will Arnett playing a talking horse, but put off by the general tone of the first few episodes.",2014
9,"An interesting show. I liked the first few episodes well enough. The main character is kind of intriguing, and the humor, while low-key is good for a few chuckles.",2014
10,"Um, hello, people, this is the most brilliant show available right now in any medium. Are you that blind??? Do you seriously NOT get the JOKE????",2016
10,"It seems funny to be describing a cartoon show where the main character is a horse and in a world where humans and a variety of animals interact as a show that is the most representative of modern society. However, Bojack Horseman provides a glamour free realistic representation that you don't witness in most TV shows.",2016
5,"I am disappointed there is not a single negative review for this poorly drawn, overrated cartoon.",2014
10,"Never before have I written a review on IMDb. Not a single one. Have been using this site since I was a young teenager (I am 25 now) and although I have been moved by and enthralled with television series and films in the past, never before has one compelled me this much to feel the need to formally post a review. That being said, The Leftovers made me write a review because it is one of the most criminally underrated, under watched and overlooked shows on television today (in America, at least). It is an absolute shame because this show is a true artistic and philosophical marvel. It forces you to truly think and truly feel while you are experiencing it, and that is something too few television shows and films do today. Nowadays, too many want a movie over a film; a show over a series. This masterpiece of a season, season 2, will be looked back upon one day as one of the greatest television seasons of any show all time. It is that rare new gem hidden amongst the knockoffs and hand me downs. Light years ahead of any competition.",2015
9,I am from England and I just so happen to be visiting some friends in the USA where this show has just come out and is presently on episode 4.,2014
8,"I guess everyone on this site is an academy award winner. The writing is not terrible, and the story line is not cliché'd. There is a ton of potential with this series and I am excited to see what comes next. The characters are compelling, there is a lot of mystery surrounding what has happened and what is happening in the future. Weird groups start to form and prophets arise as people are seeking answers as to why 140 million people just disappear. ",2014
10,"I am so disappointed to see the negative reviews on here. Damn it! I hope HBO isn't reading them, because I'm already hoping for season 2. ",2014
10,The show's writers set out to do the audience what they did with the characters--to cause confusion and pile on questions. ,2014
10,"If you enjoyed the mysteriousness of Lost (and who didn't) you will really enjoy The Leftovers. You can immediately recognize Damon Laurence Lindelof's work by viewing the 1st couple of episodes. What this series does so well is to create a different and very strange world that captures you from the start. The connection it creates with the viewer gives a sense of 'What if I was left' and leaves some questions as to how you would react or feel given the strange yet possible situation. I really enjoy the fact that the series takes it's time to reveal certain secrets or elements, which gives it so much more depth and keeps you wanting more. On the one side I'm so excited to see what happens next, but on the other side I don't want the series to reveal too much information early on, so don't mind being kept somewhat in the dark. The acting is suburb and Justin Theroux really does a superb job as lead actor. I definitely give it a 10 star for keeping me at the edge of my seat.",2014
4,So I gave it a try. I really did. Three episodes and a bit of the fourth. But it was to no avail. I just couldn't bring myself to watch any more of this drivel.,2015
10,"I will say that after watching the first episode I was on the fence about this series, but, now, after viewing 4-5 episodes, I am totally hooked and I think this is one of the most exciting new series from HBO in years. Justin Theroux is excellent in his role as the police chief (besides being extremely pleasant to look at!). I never realized he was such a great actor, but this role really stretches his ability. He has definitely not disappointed, running the full emotional gamut (father, husband, law enforcer) in his portrayal as Kevin Garvey. And the rest of the cast is great, too. This is must-see TV at its best, and I look forward to the new episode every Sunday. Bravo HBO, you have done it again!",2014
9,"Lots of very negative reviews after 4 episodes so far. Strange, since this show started well. Seems to me many of the reviewers are having problems with not understanding everything yet- ""what is this deal with the smokling guys in white? I don't get it"".",2014
9,"I can't give this series (just renewed for a second season, by the way) a ten because nothing is perfect. If there was a rating for ""As Perfect As Possible""? Hence the nine. The character development, the tight writing (without clichéd gimmicks or ridiculous dialog that only happens between fictional people) the phenomenal camera work and editing, the entire package, darn near perfect. This is an ineffable wonder of brilliant, barely controlled emotional chaos in a realistic world; not some fake island inhabited by a swirl of smoke.",2014
10,"I really don't understand why people are giving the pilot so many bad reviews.It gave enough information about the ""rapture"" to lure us in, but not completely to spoil it and leave no mystery for later. Its clearly related to Lost, but obviously has its own special elements. I think Lost was a great TV show and this TV show could end up being even better since the creators already know the things the audience dislikes and loves. I can seriously see this TV show becoming one of my favorites soon enough, and if it doesn't keep picked up for another season I will be greatly disappointed and to be honest a bit sad. To the people who disliked the pilot, I think you should wait for the second episode and give the show a second chance.",2014
1,"I assume that any positive review of this drivel must be from either one of the writers or their immediate family. Please stop saying that the negative reviews are from dense people who don't appreciate the show's subtle brilliance. Bullsh*t!!! Don't kid yourself, the viewers are not the problem; they're the victims of grossly incompetent writing.",2014
6,"The Leftovers has gotten so many one star and nine or ten star votes, but it really isn't such a great flop nor a great success either. It is mediocre, but still interesting and entertaining enough to watch, if you are into this sort of thing, and have some spare time. That said, it's not a great loss if you don't watch it either. We've seen all this before. Just like Lost, this series leaves the viewer unsatisfied, as her questions are answered only with more questions. After introducing an absurd sci-fi mystery, it turns out to be more of a bland psychological drama instead, and the pace is quite slow, yet without the tension needed to fully maintain interest. ",2016
10,"7,8 is so damn ridiculous, I understand that the first episodes of The Leftovers didn't achieve to catch everybody's attention, it started in some way, with a slow rhythm, trying to explain from the beginning the characters life three years after the departure of the 2% of the world's population. But after the third episode (spectacular as all the episodes focused on Matt Jaminson), all things initiate to clarify, all emotions started being explain,and the show took an amazing hype. You have to be blind for don't loving The Leftovers after all the events so wonderfully written by Damon Lindelof. ",2015
1,"I realize that much of what has been presented in the first three episodes of The Leftovers is meant to disturb, to perplex, pull us in, make us want to watch for eventual connections and answers.",2014
1,This show has a good concept. What if a significant amount of people suddenly vanish? What kind of possibilities could cause this? How does it change the world? ,2014
1,"The very appropriately titled The Leftovers, is like digging through my fridge, finding the same old bland crap that I didn't like enough to finish the first time, and wondering if it will still be palatable after scrape the mold off, and stuff it in the microwave, in a half baked attempt to fill a craving.",2014
7,"Strong start for this new show right out of the gate. You have another twist on the what if some folks just disappeared one day, and all the folks left behind are still wondering 3 years later why not them. ",2014

1,"First off, I want to start by saying that this show made me want to slap someone in their ear hole. The concept of the show (I've never read the books) sounded like something I would be into. It's a story that could've been something great. The two main problems I see with The Leftovers is that none of the characters are memorable and the show doesn't reward you for your time. You want to cheer for the main character, the police chief, because he lost his wife, until you realize that he's not doing much for you to care about him. You assume his wife disappeared during the ""rapture,"" only to find out she has joined a cult of silent protesters. Why did she leave her family? Her husband, son, and daughter did not disappear. Her family, unlike many depicted in the show, are still around. ",2014

10,"The Leftovers is right there at the top for me, amongst the likes of breaking bad, for its ability to make you crave more & more, drawing you in with fantastic plot lines & connecting you with the characters in a way you really feel part of what's going on. I can understand it isn't for everyone, well I can't but you know what I mean, there is a lot of ""what's going on"" but it unfolds throughout the episode's if you have the patience. For me I could tell from the start that I would love this show, the pilot episode really sucked me in & I haven't looked back. The leftovers is an emotional program, you get to see the affect of what happens to all the main characters at some point & how they deal with the hand they've been dealt. The score is also fantastic and plays a big part In the feel of the events taking place.",2017
8,"It's a series people- get over it! I'm continually amazed by folks who want to be spoon fed all of the answers to a series in the first 60 minutes. At any rate we found the first episode thought provoking. Yes, it is a little confusing and I truly hope it doesn't go down the path of LOST in which I lost interest rather quickly (because of the things in it that made no sense and never would. I mean, really, how did the heavy guy not lose any weight in the first season?!). That said, I have high hopes for this drama as I love these sorts of human stories that make you think for yourself and don't try to shove an agenda down your throat.",2014

It has weird religious overtones and I really don't feel like trying to connect dots that don't really exist. It's the Emperor's New Clothes...everyone here seems to see the Emperor dressed but to me, he's stark naked. They want ten lines for me to submit my little review...so I'll tell you about a psychology experiment I did when I was in College: I had a pile of forks and a pile of squares of tissue paper. The volunteers were asked to take some forks and some paper and wrap them. Then they were to bring then to me and take some more. When they gave them to me I would simply unwrap the forks and dump them back in the pile. The object of the experiment - much like the Leftovers - was to see how long they would stick with this useless task. While many of them left some stayed all day...and I imagine they would still be there now wrapping forks. That's how I feel about The Leftovers.",2015
8,"Well, I'm trying to write a completely spoiler-free review here, but I guess it's safe to announce that 'Penny Dreadful' looks positively gorgeous. Great production design and cinematography: by the time we get to see Victorian London as night descends upon the city and the fog starts creeping through those narrow cobblestone alleys, nearly every frame looks like a beautiful, Gothic painting (and not once did I spot a fake looking CG-background). As far as the actors are concerned, they portray their obscure, troubled characters with a certain kind of ""theatre"" intensity that fits the story and the turn-of-the-century setting very well.",2014
9,"The first episode of Penny Dreadful does a number of things right, making me hopeful for the future of this series.",2014

Rare are those moments. There may be many that do not share my perspective, nor do they taste my words and vision, but then again, I am sure that some are like me. Hungry to feel, to truly feel life, and thirsty for ambivalence, for the evil to have a good face and vice versa and more importantly to see that even flawed ones have a faith to preach and fulfil. ",2015
9,"I had to add a review of this show after i saw the minority of reviews were so negative, i really can't believe that anyone would rate this series at 1/10 that is a disgrace in itself. the production values would rival most high budget movies and the acting is definitely 2 steps up from anything else horror orientated on TV( with the exception of billie piper who does an irish mish mash of accents while pulling the faces of a bulldog chewing a wasp)this however is a minor complaint, even josh hartnett pulls it out of the bag as far as the rest of the cast go. If you like your classic horror tales or goth horror then this is definitely worth checking out, i grew up watching the mummy,Dracula,the wolfman and frankenstein on late night TV and i have to say this series revisits those nights curled beneath the duvet with the class and atmosphere of the tales from which it draws it's inspiration. well worth a look guys, don't let the downers put you off!!",2014
4,"The rule of not judging a show by it's pilot seems true once again, except this time it's the other way around. Penny Dreadful starts out strong, with beautiful scenery, eloquent dialog, mysterious characters, drama, romance and the perfect amount of gore and horror. The show starts out in the fast lane, it leaves you wanting more. But then it takes a turn right into the traffic jam. The story lines unfold extremely slow, and although they provide some depth for the characters it also loses the element of surprise and the wonderfully set horror and action scenes from the pilot are scarce throughout the rest of the series and when they return, they are exactly the same. Of course, this series is based on well known horror stories so predictability is to be expected, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is no room for interpretation. The makers of Penny Dreadful seem to think otherwise, for the only thing that surprised me was Proteus demise. The grand storyline, the saving of Mina, is a quest that takes the guys from Supernatural or Buffy (with all respect) a mere episode of 40 minutes, and it would probably end in the exact same way. Penny Dreadful's league of extraordinary gentlemen takes 8 one hour episodes to do the same. This show is great for people who enjoy seeing Eva Green make funny faces and becoming less attractive each episode and for people who enjoy the anticipation of an undead monster losing it if his master doesn't do what he wants while having the patience to stand outside in the snow for 3 months. Oh, and if you thought that this first season would end with a bang, you will be disappointed. There is nothing that will leave you wanting more, no cliffhanger, nothing except for a few small confirmations of what you've been expecting to happen some 3 or 4 episodes ago...",2014
9,As the creators' fascination with 19th century horror literature comes to life we are introduced with a result that is part gory part calculated constraint but a pure visual pleasure. The show takes you to a setting evoking a sense of alarm under all the intrigue.This feeling is heightened by the score which is both evocative and hauntingly beautiful.,2014
10,"This review is based on the pilot of the show. This show is great. It's designed for the viewers who like horror genre. It's kind of hard core and sophisticated version of Supernatural. It has elements of psychology, anatomy and history as well to draw the attention of specific viewers. Vanessa Ives character seems like supernatural female version of Sherlock Holmes. The setting of this show in the Victorian era makes it more likable. It has all the basic characters of horror themes shows like vampires etc. Super stars like Eva Green and Josh Hartnett presence as main characters also gives this show an edge over the other show of the horror genre. All the main cast is also versatile and their characters are well designed. It has a Gothic vibe going all over the series. There's no reason that this show is not gonna be a big hit. Some critics are already considering it for the best new TV series of 2014.",2014
8,"Well I'll try and not reveal much however Penny Dreadful is most certainly one of the best series on our screens at the moment. It is somewhat of a slow burner at times however it absolutely burns with a restrained ferocity very much like it's actors and characters. There's a palpable energy in every performance as there is a lot of meat to each character. Everyone is an anit-hero and personally I find all the performances very engaging. Timothy Dalton radiates a commanding and duplicitous presence that matches Eva Green's which is hard to do. Even more surprising is Josh Harnett and Harry Treadaway keeping toe to toe with them both also. Billy Piper's just warming up too. I'm a veteran Horror fan and rarely have I seen such quality in feature length movies. I just watched the last in the current series and it was emotional, the trick to the P Team is that the monsters are center stage and they are very human. Rory Kinnear induces both horror and extreme pathos that very much surprises. Logan has crafted something special, something very well thought out and acted and executed in every aspect with care. The script is the only one on screen at the moment that reminds me of The Game of Thrones in the fact that every line of dialogue is loaded with meaning, coupled with the Victorian setting means that everyone is hiding something and every word is crafted. Very unusual and highly recommended, nothing is as it seems in Penny Dreadful and the characters are all the more relatable for their failings and apparent monstrousity.",2014
5,"This show has everything to make an awesome show. I was expecting a lot but after watching the first season I ended up quite disappointed. Problem is that I should have liked this show. I like this type of shows, I like Showtime shows, I like the period and the theme. I even like the main actors. ",2014
9,"If you have watched a lot of TV and you have ever asked what it would be like to mix Ripper Street with Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Supernatural, putting the whole thing on an unrated cable station, then you would possibly have had a show like this in mind. That nonsense aside this is a really well produced, and seems to be quite deeply thought out show that mixes all of the sense of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the opening act gave me a sensation of an early days origin story for R.I.P.D. some sort of Men in Black for the supernatural types. I Enjoyed this show quite a bit, it really does stand out in it's heavy levels of gore, and violence, and the acting Eva Green alone is just completely Ice on fire, but the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. I recommend this movie to fans of the science fiction mash-ups, as that is exactly what this is, if you like action, and can appreciate truly adult horror the corrupt, and dirty kind, then this is for you. The entire production is cinema quality, if you understand how many levels Banshee is above most TV, you will appreciate this show in a very similar way.",2014
7,"After a slightly shaky start, (I think trying to encapsulate the stories of Frankenstein and his monster, Dracula, Dorian Gray, not to mention a rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", with a werewolf thrown in for good measure, might have been going a creature or two too far), ""Penny Dreadful"" turned out to be one of the year's more pleasant, as well as nastiest, surprises. Unlike the pretentious, art-house gore-fest that is ""Hannibal"" this was imaginative, fast-moving, just the right side of silly when it needed to be and intelligent, (and suitably gruesome), in just the right proportions, adhering very much to the spirit of the originals if not to their text. It was also very well acted by a decent and starry cast, (as a young Victor Frankenstein and his creature both Luke Treadaway and Rory Kinnear were outstanding while even Josh Hartnett acquitted himself quite well this time round), written and directed. For once I'm looking forward to Series Two already.",2014
3,I watched the first five and half episodes before finally deciding to clear up some DVR space and was angry that I didn't make that decision after the second episode. The dialog in this show is so drawn out that you will find yourself more frustrated than entertained. I mean a understand the need for character development but this show goes overboard in some cases i.e. the stupid letter episode which lead me to hit the delete button for the whole series half way through the episode. ,2014

1,"That awful excuse of horror that you call a show. On top of that, I have to pay showtime money just to give these horrible actors a time slot. Dreadful is show about zombies mixed with vampires. On top of that the show made no sense what so ever. I'm assuming that what they were trying to give in to the Zombie hype. By copying the styles of American horror story and the walking dead. You can tell that setting of the show is mostly based on originals, Dracula and Werewolf movies. This soup of whatever people like is not the way to go. False advertisement and lies all I conceived. Thinking back the commercials showed me a show about satanic proportions.Blood everywhere and scenes of horror. The only thing I saw was that excuse for horror you call a show.",2014
3,"Penny Dreadful started out as a Period Horror with extreme violence and a great cast. The first two episodes do match the expectations and although literally quite bloody,held your interest. It introduced an amalgamation of literary characters from Frankenstein,Dorian Gray,Van Helsing and so on. The set pieces and cinematography is above average and is actually very similar in mood to Hannibal which is set in a different era altogether. That's the good bit. Since then, it feels as if the director and creator have just got lost in the pursuit of edgy and ultra violent horror and forgot the script.Its a bit like watching a movie with great CGI where you can chomp on your pop corn until the next great set piece.Similarly here, there are many places where you could fast forward missing absolutely nothing.In fact even missing some episodes may not make any difference to viewing. Depiction of bloody, real bloody violence,explicit sex and horror make-up does not make a good engaging horror/thriller. This one is a let down and sadly so.",2014

2,"It is a shame that this show is so bad, dreadful even, because it features a number of very gifted actors. The story line is an empty husk that just keeps throwing in more and more characters in the hope that it will end up somewhere. However, you may really like this show if you ever really wanted to see Josh Hartnett make out with another man. The gratuitous sex across the board is also just too much. It doesn't add anything to the stories that we could not already figure out, but hey, the audience today demands it, right? Pity that today adult only means sex and gore, and not an ability to appreciate and understand more complex story lines that don't go for the cheap thrill or shock.",2015

5,"I am going to tread carefully on this one since we are only 2 episodes into the story. I can start off describing it as vague and coincidental. The introduction was a really rough ride for me due to the fact that the first 2-3 minutes are nothing but heavy breathing. Sorry, that alone does not inspire dread. You could close your eyes and just listen and you would think somebody is masturbating. The character introduction was just as bad except for Eva Greens' character which turns out to be the one to hold my interest in the series. Again, I use the expression vague in turn of lazy when it comes to introducing said characters, especially torturous is the moment we get to meet Dr. Frankenstein. Lazy.",2014

2,"Watching the first episode, I realized that it was some kind of combination of Dracula, Frankenstein and The Mummy + The Exorcist. The series has unfortunately turned out to be pure slop, although starring famous actors as Dalton and Hartnett. As the authors themselves do not even know where to turn around, they started, but don't know how to finish, constantly circling within something that want to start but doesn't know how to do it. Some scenes with Frankenstein's monster, not only that but they are grotesque, they are also and morbidly ill. I expected a lot more than this. Basically, I do not like this mixed waste. Big fat thumb down!",2014

10,"Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. ",2014
9,"After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.",2014
10,"There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.",2015
9,This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.,2014
1,"This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.",2015
9,"Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films.",2014
3,"My non-musician friends love this film and insisted I see it. I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, ""I know, let's build a show to save the town!"" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film. P.S. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. Hah!",2015

No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine.

4,"In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical ""criminal"" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet.",2014
1,"I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed.",2015
1,"If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.",2015

This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama ""Whiplash."" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' ""Captain Phillips,"" coincidentally also was a NYFF title.

4,"Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen ""alternate"" drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people.",2015

I have learned and practiced 2 instruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this Shaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would never work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive.

1,"this is played out as if the young musicians are in boot camp. the head teacher is more vicious drill sergeant than music teacher. anyone who has played an instrument will tell you, yes that practise is hard and you have to be committed, but it is always enjoyable and fulfilling. no one in this film seems to take pleasure in playing music. it is so ludicrous, over the top and ultimately just plain corny. they spell out what the film is about in very childish dialogue as if an audience cannot pick up on what the teacher is trying to do. scene after scene of bombastic emotional and physical brutality. any teacher teaching as this sadist does would not last a week, let alone manage to impart any kind of knowledge into his pupils. then we have the ending the kid races against time, survives a head on car collision and still makes it to the gig, (whereupon the teacher has change what they are going to play just for spite, this is the kind of character he has been throughout this one note film,) and then still manages that old cliché of killing them dead with his boring drum solo. drumming is not about speed its about making melody from skins. Overrated by critics who by now really don't know what makes a good film",2014

10,"Love this show for several reasons, but mainly for the fact that it's fast paced mindless fun. I love the fact that it's not politically correct and that it's shamelessly patriotic. The acting is definitely not Shakespeare and the science portrayed is dodgy at best and I'm OK with that. If I wanted actual realism I would watch a documentary about the navy. The Last Ship is the dramatic equivalent of a Big Mac and Fries and it doesn't claim to be anything else. Personally for myself I am extremely sick of police procedural's or any shows about doctors , lawyers,vampires, zombies. So this show is a definite breath of fresh air. As always your mileage may very.",2014
3,"I gave this 3 out of 10, purely because the effects and ship footage were surprisingly good. The only reason I tuned in to the pilot was because of the promising footage in the trailer and the premise.",2014

10,"This show is so underrated. It is the best summer show of the year. I gave so many shows a chance, but this is the only one that had a solid plot, acting, and all around excellent writing.",2014
1,I enjoyed the first couple of episodes. You expect a new show to be a bit rough around the edges but the premise was good and had potential.,2014
2,"I've watched 4 episodes of ""Last Ship"", giving it a try as a new series. The basic premise of the show is a good one-- VERY loosely based on the novel-- about the crew of a US Navy ship that is in the midst of a global viral pandemic. The biggest problem with the show, though, is the writing. It is, to be blunt, awful. The cast does the best it can with the script, and there are some talented actors in the mix (and some not very talented, but that's OK)...but the logic and reasons behind each of the episodes, the actual story, is so poorly thought out and with plot holes you could drive an aircraft carrier through.",2014
10,"Having served in the Navy (not USN), I can totally relate to the show. The parlance and details depicted are as close as one can get to the real thing. Being a Commanding Officer is not for the faint hearted. Making decisions that require a higher sense is depicted very well. The makers of the show have demonstrated a wonderful eye for detail. The bosun's pipe can be heard at the right time. One thing that does need to be addressed is matching the ship's wake when she is underway. At times the wake generated is not in keeping with the ordered speed. The plot itself is unwinding quite well and leaves one guessing with whats going to happen next. A fantastic effort indeed.",2014
7,"I was expecting a run of the mill drama with a portrayal of the Navy similar to what we saw on JAG or NCIS and that's basically what it is. My main reason for watching it in the first place was Mitra and Baldwin and overall I was positively surprised. It's not edgy, extraordinary or comes up with it's own new ideas but it's a very well executed and produced TV show with a cohesive plot and character depiction and some nuances of development. Baldwin, Dane and Mitra carry this show and they do it well. Some of the scenes can be quite cheesy with all the patriotism and military tradition going on, but overall they found a good balance between the cheesy stuff, action, drama and progress in the story. Also the quality is very steady, so if you watch the pilot you get the gist of the show.",2014

8,"I have to admit, watching first few episodes, i felt the storyline is quite ridiculous. but i kept on watching, cause its not everyday u get a series that based on Navy, ships and so on. the characters are quite good to kept me kept watching. Adam Baldwin is mainly the reason cause i missed seeing him in action since Chuck. so i watch it right till the end of season 1 and couldn't get enough of it. very looking forward for season 2! my advice to people who just start watching, watch it till the end of season 1, u'll be writing a glowing review like me too!",2014
8,"A little bit Walking dead, a little bit JAG, put it on a Navy Destroyer during the end of the world, and you have the Last Ship. This is an exciting action adventure that hearkens back to the days of TV yor when TV was good. When the characters were not all strung out crack heads killing each other over a couple of bucks. The immediate draw for me was Adam Baldwin (love me some Jayne Cobb) but the rest of the cast is mostly really good. The Captain carries the show nicely, and even the lesser characters that aren't quite as good, are still watchable. The most impressive thing about TLS is the production value. I'm not sure how much TNT puts into each episode, but its a lot, and it shows. If you like action adventure, with good guys and bad, then you WILL like The Last Ship.",2014
1,"The only way this show will make it is if it's sold as comedy. Terrible acting, completely cheesy scenes, unbelievable and unrealistic incidents...on and on. B-rate at best. Watches like a 1980's Godzilla movie. I especially liked the plug for LGBT in the military... Came off like a really obvious, and really bad add placement. Like someone threw it in there as an after thought. The writing is as amateur as you can get. Determinately watching the next episode. Haven't seen TV this funny in a long time. Great plot; too bad they ruined it. It's one of those shows that may get pulled mid-season. We can always hope. For this thing to have 7 stars, the cast of Idiocracy bust be the ones watching and rating.",2014

1,"Watching this first episode, to me it plaid out like a bad made for TV movie that would show on Syfy. The acting was subpar, the special effects were god awful.",2014
4,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* I thought the idea for the movie was sound then I watched it. So much just didn't make sense. Why would a nuclear missile be targeting France only miles from the ship? They got the part right where the EMP takes out the electronics on board the ship but a) it didn't take out the electronics in the lab on board the ship, b) the EMP had no affect upon the cruise ship and c) why didn't the captain order all electronics shut off since he ordered the crew to cover their eyes? Just asking. How is it that the Russians can get a spy as the doctors assistant because they should have known each other for a long time and the spy would have to have extensive microbiological training? The number of flaws in the show outweigh the stuff they got right by a wide margin. You must suspend all knowledge of information in order to enjoy this show.",2014
2,Its hard to say anything positive about The Last Ship. They story line taps into the now long running virus end of the world scenario. The difference on this occasion is the survivors are a bunch of US navy types accompanied by a British scientist and her sidekick on a ship. ,2014
7,Review based on the pilot episode.,2014

9,"I have been a member of IMDb for many many years now and am a big movie and TV enthusiast. That said, until now, not once have I felt the need to type up a review. ",2014
9,"Silicon Valley is a TV show that was much talked about even before it's debut on HBO. With the Silicon Valley now finding a Hollywood-like atmosphere in the way it's viewed, the entertainment industry's focus on Silicon Valley and it's unique lifestyle and culture is somewhat new and has yet to find it's equilibrium of representation between the reality of the innovation happening there and the bizarre, comedy ammunition that lies in some of the more eccentric aspects. Mike Judge's Silicon Valley is a damn good start. It's witty and scathing, and takes an sarcastic approach to it with an outsider's eye. Of course, Mike Judge is no outsider, having worked in Palo Alto during the late 80's, and his disdain for it's people and culture shows.",2014
10,I really don't like other HBO Comedies like Girls and Looking. I heard about this show and I'm a programmer myself so i thought i will give it a chance and I'm not disappointed.,2014
8,"I was a little skeptical about this show at first and went into with the impression that I would try it but it would lose my interest after an episode or two. This show so far has been a wonderful surprise. Unlike some comedies that create forced, awkward situations that are only funny to the recorded laugh track that plays, I have burst out laughing from a number of scenes that have aired in the few episodes so far. It is very original, smart, has a believable story and characters and has many funny moments with quite a few scenes that will catch you off guard and you will die laughing. At first this was just a show I was DVR'ing then watching at some point during the week maybe a few days later. However the last few episodes have been great and I have been watching live while it airs because it isn't a stupid comedy, it keeps you interested with a pretty good story.",2014
10,The characters are great. It's going to be a good show. You know a show will be good when there are a number of good characters introduced in the first 1/2 hour. Very rarely do I laugh out loud but it happened a few times in the first episode. ,2014
7,"I just LOVE most of the characters. There is so much good stuff going on, but every episode ends the same. Here we go. EPISODE #? - EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT WITH PIED PIPER. - EPISODE#?, 'after 40 minutes, the company is worth ????? million, and nothing could be better. - Until - 43 minutes, by some strange twist, everything has fallen apart, and the company has gone to the dogs. - AGAIN! How long can this story go on? It is just far to predictable. There are only ever two different scenarios for every episode. - Either the company and everyone is multi, multi millionaires, or they have not got a pot to piddle in.",2017

9,"Great pilot episode. I love entrepreneurship, silicon valley and that whole tech culture so I was really excited about this show. I was very impressed with it. Lots of laughs, really accurate to the geek world of programmers and the characters are normal. They aren't glorified in any way which I really like.",2014
9,"Silicon Valley is an HBO tech-series with all the typical stereotypes. An overweight stoner, an emaciated wannabe cyber-criminal, a witty Indian with characteristic accent, and the centerpiece, a gangly socially awkward CEO.",2014
9,As a programmer and an app entrepreneur myself I absolutely liked the first 2 episodes so far. I hope this will be a great series overall. ,2014
10,"Silicon Valley does something that not many comedies shows do; that is making you become emotionally invested in its storyline and characters. it consists deep underlining themes about modern day life, business and friendship whilst remaining truly hilarious! It's why I love this show so much.",2016
9,"For those expecting ""Beavis and Butthead"" right out of the gate when Judge and co. created ""King of the Hill"", the audience looking for silly shock humor were surprised to find spot-on characters populating the screen that could have come from their real life. That meant plenty of younger folks tuned out... But lots of us saw it for what it was and enjoyed the hell out of it. Now, to be fair, I'm not saying ""ALL HAIL MIKE JUDGE"", especially considering that I was not a big fan of ""Extract"" and was ho-hum on ""The Goode Family."". Yet I DO have faith that Judge's work is trying to make something more thought-provoking with a good storyline than the average comedy.",2014
10,"Others have written far clearer synopsis, I'm just here to gush. For reference: my idea of good TV writing and taste = breaking bad, persons of interest, the good wife, Battlestar remake, better call Saul, John Oliver, the Office, Arrested Development. ",2016
9,"I rarely write reviews for TV shows, but considering how incredible ""Silicon Valley"" is, I felt like sharing my 2 cents on the topic. Many of the reviews for this show were after or during season 1, so i'm happy to say that the show is still amazing halfway through season 4. ",2017
9,"Coming from a surprising First Season, Silicon's Valley Season 2 doesn't disappoint either. The addition of new characters was a wise decision to not let the series become worn. As something already recognized in Season 1 and in this season continues is the well-done performance of the actors in creating different stereotypes of people who live in the valley, not only programmers, but businessmen and others too. In my opinion, the best additions to the Second Season were Russ Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos) and Pete Monahan(Matt McCoy), because when they were in the scene, they were the ones who made me laugh the most. But the one who stands out of all is Erlich Bachman(T.J. Miller), this guy is amazing.",2015
10,"Wow, just an amazing show I absolutely love it. The characters specifically are funny as hell and each one brings something new to the table. Mike Judge has created a sophisticated, funny TV show that is clever and well worth a watch. I had only seen a couple of Mike Judge creations (Beavis and Butt head and Office space) before watching the show so I didn't really now what to expect but I was pleased to find that he has made the show not only an accurate depiction of the real Silicon Valley but also accessible to the masses. I was especially impressed with the character of Erlich played by TJ Miller as he is not only funny but also the way he aggravates the other members of the hacker house allows for a lot of funny scenes. I really hope the show stays around for a while as I am really enjoying it.",2014

10,Story is nicely crafted and loves the concepts and it clearly explains how the startup company will face the difficulties initially and how they are succeeded after all difficulties. Pied Piper is the perfect name. Compression algorithm concept is new and it is most expected one on today world to manage big data. And Play between two billionaires is showing exactly how the tech industry is as of now. Initially I'm not interested in serials.. and after watching the trailer and impressed and started watching the shows on TV. It is already planned for next season. Currently I watched the Ep:07 from season 2. And waiting for the more seasons in future.,2015
10,"My current favorite TV show by far! As a veteran of Silicon Valley, I am always hypercritical of movies and TV shows that attempt to portray the history and lifestyle of the Valley, which typically are about 10% accurate and 90% nonsense (e.g. The Social Network, Jobs, Pirates of Silicon Valley, etc.). But I was pleasantly surprised with HBO's Silicon Valley, which not only gets most aspects of the high-tech start-up world dead right, it's also side-splitting hilarious! Of course it is over-the-top with tongue firmly in cheek, but to do good parody, you need to know your subject well, and Mike Judge (Beavis & Butthead, King of the Hill, Office Space), who was himself an engineer in Silicon Valley in the late 1980's, absolutely nails it.",2015

10,"People can say what they want about 50 cent but he did a great job with this show. Power looks genuine and the story is very appealing. The cast in the show are marvelous especially Omari Hardwick. Expect this actor in great roles in the future. I really hope this show makes 2-3 seasons because the quality of the first episode was too good. The soundtrack of the Movie is good too, they use popular songs in a couple of scenes. The cars, the suits and the Environment is very well picked. I live in Sweden and i hope this will come to Europe. There are too many bad series on TV and this show would fit TV anywhere. I will follow this shot until the very end and i will enjoy it. This show is above of what i expected.",2014
9,"""Power"" is a great show that seems to invite the viewer to watch more and more of it. I couldn't just stop at one episode, I had to watch them one after another. Some may have their doubts on this show, but I must say it is one of my favorites, due to the fact that it has a great story line and is balanced perfectly between scenes. I can't wait to see where the show goes and how the characters will change throughout the show. 50 Cent has done an excellent job in making this show not just good, but great. ",2014
9,"50 Cent and STARZ Have made a really solid show in Power. Great well mixed cast of mostly well known actors who are all very believable in their rolls. The story so far is very well developed, and once you get past the introductions (and the show gets down to the truth) and the real business is revealed, then you are rewarded with the darkness that really runs things. This is shaping up to be a really good series, and with Starz you know there will be no corners cut, they have real competition out there, and they know it. This show in a nutshell is the family values of Luck or Ray Donovan or even Sopranos, and all the secret back room, and backseat goings on as well. Full of sex, and violence, but mostly a story of one powerful man and all of the things he needs to keep in the air at once.",2014
10,"everything Curtis Jackson (50 cent) touches turns to gold but perhaps the best choice he made about this phenomenon is that he decided to pass on playing Ghost and left it up to the incredible Omar. Between the directing, editing, music, casting, and acting..this show is consistently riveting and absolutely captivating. One of the best dramas currently on TV or in a very long time. The sub plots and story arcs are always engaging from week to week leaving me anxiously awaiting more. I absolutely love this show and if you've been sitting on this gem do your self a favor and catch up you wont be sorry i promise. It has all the ingredients to make a perfect show and will no doubt last for awhile based on critics and viewers reviews plus the very high ratings.",2015
10,"Not gonna lie this show has me and my girl hooked on Saturday nights, it doesn't look b-rated as we thought it might and has a very appealing storyline. Honestly i cant wait to see where we will be in a few more episodes...DOPE SHOW, DOPE CAST, just plain Ole DOPE!!!!!! 50 has not asserted himself in the cast to where he is taking over the screen or ball hogging. The main cast are definitely working well together. I cant complain on the place the show is going. Plus its nice to see some fresh African American content being added to the Saturday night lineups. The soundtrack and music keep it feeling fresh so your not bored with unknown low quality tunes playing in the background like most of OUR shows. Im happy and excited and so is my girl.",2014
8,"Excellent show, let's see what the future episodes will bring. The story makes me remember some of the pursuit from Homeland where the criminal it's possibly right in front of you and you do not even see him. This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a great drama series and hoping to have a good time. I have to bring up the choices of the songs for this, really good especially the opening theme with 50 cent brand new music! We can tell that if you wanted to see a gripping thriller with incredible characters, you have come to the perfect place. At least I think that this series has everything to become a real good show if it goes by this line of development of the situations. The main actor 'Ghost' has a real good charisma and presence in the show, to be honest I didn't know him and I'm already rendered to his performance.",2014
10,"I had to log in to IMDb to a write a review on the site for the very first time to express how delighted I am in POWER! The most recent episode was so suspenseful that I nearly busted a vein in my neck after all the drama. Full of game changers and heart stopping thrills, POWER solidifies all the elements of a perfectly cast, powerfully scripted, great show. I don't want to give any spoilers. I just wanted to say that I hope this show has a very long run and people catch on to this diamond in the rough. ",2015
10,"Love this show love the fact as a Black man you can play the good and bad of what most from the inner city actually go through. This show highlights a man who has to choose from legal to illegal ways if you from the inner city you know a guy like this who finds ways to cover up they illegal activity with legal activity finding a way to choose from one and leaving the other alone. No drug dealer stays on the top long you either go to jail or you dead so for this show to highlight how drug dealers who are on top do turn around they life is great it speaks to those who are caught in that life. Listen if you find your self caught up in illegal ways this show shows there are opportunities you can create for yourself that will be great for you and your family. Each character played in this show represents someone i grew up with the friend who back stabs you that wants you to remain the same no growth, The girlfriend who enjoys what she has not what she can maintain, The other woman who has her act together that you want to end up with and find a future together. So many of these characters are so real i find myself loving the fact i grew up in Chicago found a way to do something positive but raised around so much negativity to seeing those turn they life around and become something of their selves by investing in a more comfortable future. Great show man great show i can relate and i know if you from the inner city you can too.",2014
2,"I am so, so, so, so disappointed in Season 3 of ""Power"". For the first two seasons despite the nudity I watched the show because I was interested in the plot, yes, the plot. Yes, I understand drugs and violence are interconnected so of course I expected to see violence. Got it. I understand that people have sex,yep, got that too. What I don't understand is why season 3 is explicitly wrapped around sex c-o-n-s-t-a-n-t-l-y.",2016

All the actors are amazing and perfectionists.This show is drama filled and keeps me on the edge of my seat.Power is the next best thing.I'm a warrior, yes, a Scandal warrior.But, I'm also a power addict and I can't get enough. Can't wait for the next season.I love the moral of the story. Your local big time drug dealer dating a nark(cop). This is priceless and not seen everyday. A bestfriend who feels like he is alone in the game and is falling in love with a women who is bad news. The perfect wife to sit home,cook,clean and maintain the kids. There's something behind every corner of this dramatic motion picture.",2014
5,"Power is a let down. I've given the show 5 as a mark of respect for the work and overall effort that goes into making a TV show. Nevertheless, Power offers nothing more than unimaginative creativity. The writing is jaded and the aesthetic is reminiscent of a Disaronno advert. It's as though someone has given an eighteen year old a vast amount of money with the instruction to 'make a TV show son.'",2014
2,"Where did the engaging story line from Seasons 1 & 2 go? The characters are weak this year (really Tariq), and whoever thought of bringing Kanin back from the dead should be booted (oh yeah, he's the Producer, right). Some of the relationships and sex scenes just materialize out of nowhere, and we're suppose to accept all of this as normal, right? Ghost, the most interesting character, is only shown infrequently while in jail. Tommy coming more into his own--OK, I can buy that, but all going on around him is weak.",2017
1,"It seems like the writer draws a blank and throws a sex scene in every ten minutes, take a refresher course or something, the scenes w/o the sex are way more entertaining. If I want to watch porn, I'll do so. We get it, the characters know what sex is and how to have it, message received.",2017
5,"This is by no means a terrible series. However, there are just too many things that bug me about it and it starts to rub in like a blister as the series goes on. ",2017
7,"Finally, able to catch up on all my recordings of this show. I was actually surprised and loved the twists and turns. The storyline opens up a lot of discourse about corruption in every facet of life and must commend the writers for being able to bring all these to the table.",2017
8,"This is a well crafted series with an intelligent story line. It's believable and sophisticated with one exception: Ghost's high-school love interest. That is the only sub-pot in the series I found incredibly trite and boring. It gets so drawn out and ridiculous, I find myself hoping it fades away.",2017
8,"I didn't know what to expect from this series, and have been pleasantly surprised.",2014
1,"Anything with 50 cents in it forces me to the off swith. His acting leaves something to be desired. Wooden, stereotyped. This guy really does need to get back to music and leave the acting to the professionals. The show itself is OK but his inclusion has put me off from watching it.",2017
9,"Very rarely do i get caught up in movies but this one definitely grabbed my attention. Very balanced and well structured script in which the actors are doing excellent job as well. Intriguing and involving different interesting plot twists throughout the different episodes . Most of the time I do many things simultaneously when I watch different movies but this one definitely caught my attention. I highly recommend it to anyone bored of the trivialities which are broadcast-ed on a daily basis. Additionally , the script looks intriguing and sometimes many interesting things pop out. I am definitely looking forward to the next episodes to see how the show will unveil.",2015
5,"So I started watching this with high expectations, I had many recommendations from friends. I blitzed through the first season and thought it was good, not amazing but very watchable. ",2017
10,"OMFG so I just finished watching S2 of ""Power"" and after catching up I decided to write a review for both seasons combined. I personally loved this television series. I also enjoy gritty and violent crime drama shows so this was right up my alley. The story centers around James St. Patrick AKA Ghost and Tommy Egan who run a lucrative business together and how it affects their lives. The story in S1 I enjoyed and though I have heard gripes that it pushed to fast I thought the tempo was on point. The second season though blew S1 out of the water in storytelling with every character getting a good amount of screen time and S2 definitely had a hell of a lot more drama and intrigue then S1 and I personally found that to be dope. I will move onto the acting which was Superb everyone was cast perfectly. Ghost played by Omari Hardwick was on point and my personal favorite Tommy Egan played by Joseph Sikora was a Beast at his role and by far the best partner to a main protagonist to any show I have ever seen and I watch a ton of television. The action was very well executed no pun intended lol. I mean it was good in S1 but it came out like a Hurricane in S2 with the allocated slots of bodies being dramatically increased. The action was on point and at certain times not cliché which I thought was very good since so many shows are cliché today. The cinematography and the location of the show was shot beautifully with every frame selling the lifestyle and danger behind the life. I will close with saying that this is a MUST-WATCH Show for anyone who loves gritty and gangster style shows with a ton of gray. The third season premiers in July. My hat goes off to Courtney Kemp Agboh and especially 50 cent AKA Curtis Jackson for creating and producing this Masterpiece. I hope that there will be a 4th season but one season at a time. Thanks and have a lovely night.",2016

9,"Such a great show, always something happening. Never a dull moment and always feels fresh. Does not get nearly enough recognition, definitely watch it if you get the chance, great modern, New York based show.",2018
3,"Madam Secretary herself turns out to be just a little too brilliant to be believable. I prefer characters that are a bit more flawed, and are not able to finish everyone's sentences with details that only an expert in that particular subject or field would normally know. It's also too convenient that she often has gone to college with, or knows personally, someone who becomes central to plots involving national security. Again, just too unrealistic. These things annoyed me a little at first, and by the time I hit episode 17, I had to throw in the towel – I just couldn't watch any more. Sorry Madam Secretary, I tried to like you.",2015
3,"The writers of this show should be fired for their understanding of international politics. There is no understanding of negotiations, leverage, or game theory. Basic concepts of world order are thrown out the window, and the Secretary of State has no real strategic purpose other than as a mother for the world--sitting down disruptive world leaders in an ad hoc process to resolve crises as they emerge.",2015
10,"This is not weighty, or particularly politically sophisticated, but for a feel good (normally), well made, well scripted series it's good enough to look forward to each week, like meeting up with a friend. The characters in the program are particularly enjoyable and for that alone it's worth at least a try.",2017
9,"I don't understand why people are giving poor reviews, maybe they have only viewed the pilot. They could have expanded more, but people should not be so quick to leave a review after only seeing 60 minutes of a season series. So far I have only viewed the pilot and the first episode, but I am anticipating it will get high reviews. Anyone who enjoys watching the TV series Scandal, should enjoy this series as well. Scandal is quite violent and into shock value. To compare the two shows I find the writing far superior. Tea Leoni was an excellent choice. She is a wonderful actor and I have enjoyed all her movies. She can make you feel the emotions of the script every time.",2014
5,"Compared to other female lead political dramas, this is more believable than 'State of Affairs' with Katherine Heigl and less heavy handed than 'Commander in Chief' with Geena Davis. I like the intelligent look Tea Leoni has. She is slightly too attractive but nevertheless very watchable Secretary of State and ex CIA agent. Her kids are a little annoying especially the eldest daughter. Her husband played by Tim Daly is also some undercover NSA agent. Current headline areas of international diplomatic conflict are incorporated into the episodes. The flaw is in some of the writing. She seems to be able to solve major problems independently of the President. Also there is a slightly patronizing tone. Diplomats from other countries are portrayed as rather pig headed and unreasonable and she is shown to be the voice of reason. Maybe showing her being on the wrong side in the international arena occasionally would make it more rounded and less of a fairy tale.",2014
8,"Being from Europe and not really interested in the details of US politics, I watched the show simply as entertainment and did not take it too seriously. Too bad some people take it as propaganda, it's only a TV show...",2014
9,"This show is a vast improvement over the endless line of political-TV dramas and crime thrillers they keep pumping out. Madam Secretary gives us great acting by the leads, especially Tea Leoni, with intelligent scripting and story lines, and it avoids the slick gratuitous violence and obligatory torture seen nightly in every prime time TV political and crime drama that modern audiences seem to get off on so much. My only single complaint is the unnecessary interplay between Daisy and Matt; Patina Miller overacts (as if she's real nervous and can't sit still), and the two were already fighting before we knew there was even something going on; either way, it is a rather irritating sideshow to the real story lines. The three kids need some more development, but all in good time. But overall, this is a very good new series and I hope they keep it going! Robert",2014
1,"I am not overly thrilled with political 'thrillers' on American TV. They are so painfully left, every plot is plastered in the audience's face. You know who the bad guys are...conservatives and anything on the left is good. Fine, I expect that, and sometimes these boot-licker productions can be entertaining...and funny. This thing just drags for the most part. There are times when things do get exciting, but not always. Of course this is free presidential advertisement for a once senator and Secretary of State. The lapdogs are bound to bang their drums...it happens on both sides. This is a show for others, but not for me. Three stars is too much UPDATE...I changed my rating to one, vice three...phew...I feel so much better now. The goal of these weekly-political commercials is so obvious, why not use her real name? Ah well. At this point, what difference does it make? I know this production will render plenty of desired results, although I am doubtful that there will be widespread comprehension amongst the loyalist masses.",2015
1,I love Tea Leoni. I actually love the premise of this show too. I love the chief of staff and the president character in this show. The issue is that there are logical issues and little quirks about this show that make no sense and seems a bit of deuce ex machinae and religious propaganda which is just strange.,2014
3,"Well, i want to laugh but instead i become very angry. This is just a fairy tale for Americans. A secretary of state taking back an American agent, condemned to death, just offering a mark in college to Russian's foreign minister daughter? And then the same secretary of state having China and Japan sign a treaty over few island? Well, not only this, she also stops a 3rd world war! And what about the new Snowden? She takes back, to judge as traitor, someone who reveals secrets, like Snowden. Its obvious Snowden is like a nail to US officials-and in this show, in one episode, they take revenge. Oh, and not to forget: this woman, the secretary of state, is liberal! Yes! So, imagine how it would be with a fanatic, conservative instead. Well, as i said, for Americans a fairy tale. For all us, outside of US, who know what means US foreign policy, either we will watch it as comedy and laugh, or we simply watch another show ind\stead.",2014

1,"Yes, this was just bad. What is the intent? to highlight the difficulty of keeping a family life while being in office? The pilot failed in that front.",2014
3,"This show is for all those people who thought that American Sniper should have won the Oscar for best picture. It is all about justifying the use of off the books special ops, and uses obvious racism and many other biases to try to justify these actions. The cast was fine, and I do enjoy watching Téa Leoni. She has a lot of potential, too bad she got lured into doing drone strike propaganda. What we need are more shows like Homeland, The Wire, The Newsroom, The Blacklist, Utopia UK (not the reality show), Person Of Interest, and House Of Cards. I was seriously disappointed, but you can learn a lot about people from what they lie about... E:)",2015
2,"First you take a great Danish series Borgen which makes politics and family a compelling view and then you figure some TV network mogul thinks, ""Wow, lets take a great foreign show and turn it into an American political melodrama; and make the plot ridiculous."" Of course, in America the Secretary of State can do end runs around the President and Congress without getting fired: at least she can on TV. Leoni plays an ex CIA analyst, college professor who is recruited by her former boss who is now the President and in no time with her abrasive, take no prisoner (but free prisoners) charm she becomes a political bulldozer. If you like Hilary Clinton and like to fantasize about having her move up the power structure to POTUS then this is your series. Of course, if you like your political TV with more bite then you can eschew Madam Secretary as you binge on House of Cards.",2014
8,Of all the new shows this season I decided to give Madam Secretary a shot as I have always liked Téa Leoni as an actor.,2014
1,"Knowing full well that CBS was out to rewrite history and portray Hilary as a strong Secretary of State, I was not prepared for the total absurdity of this show's premier. I watched it for amusement, and was not disappointed. Mrs. Clinton's plain vanilla, if not down right embarrassing tenure in the go get lost little girl bone that Obama threw her in 2008, was turned inside out on Sunday night as we saw a gunslinger instead of the political coward, and inept Sec of State that hallmarked her 4 years in office, during which time the whole middle east crumbled (without her visiting there one time), Iran continued its march toward nuclear weapons (without her involvement whatsoever), and our foreign service officers in Benghazi were murdered under her watch, only to be trivialized by her shallow reaction to such a bump in the road. Not to mention the cover up, and her hiding under the blankets while the nation mourned. The ""real"" Mrs Clinton, who managed to marry a president, accomplished nothing as a senator, and less as a sec of state. The thought of this woman in the Oval Office would be hilarious, if it were not so horrifying.",2014
10,"I love this show. It talks about many topics and some of which are things that we are facing in today's society. People don't realize the hard work and dedication that the President Of The United States, Secretary Of State, and all parties involve to make our country and our world a better place. To me, this shows kind of gives me an insight on what goes on behind closed doors in Washington D.C., and for them to invite us to see things that they do, what lengths they go just to make us safe. They work non stop just for us. And we as the people should be grateful for what they all are doing and still is doing for us each and everyday. I am a huge fan of this show and hope that one day I get the chance to experience this.",2017
1,"Such potential, most interesting subject, reduced to trivial, topical, obvious objectives. If US policy were actually this simple and derivative, we would be ignored by 75% of the world (100% if we deduct US television viewers). Let us hope this program is not viewed elsewhere as a true portrait of our protocol in identifying and implementing foreign policy. Within the first 5 minutes the subject and the outcome are obvious and there is no need to continue watching. Where a multi-page letter is appropriate and desirable, a picture postcard is all you can expect. CBS, get it together, your viewers deserve better, which you usually deliver.",2015
3,"I gave it a three or four episodes before deciding it really was rubbish and won't be watching any more. Nothing wrong particularly with the acting , production values or cast, what really irked me was the simplistic almost Disney channel feel to it. Everything was so easy for Madam secretary, no problem no matter how difficult wasn't solved just like that with her ridiculously young assistants helping out. The more seasoned experienced players in the WH didn't seem to know what to do, ever. So consequently it lost any drama or tension for me. It's a bit like a Steven Seagal Movie, he never gets hit or hurt, just once I'd like to see him get into a bit of difficulty.",2014
2,Depending on your political and personal leanings you may view Madam Secretary from a variety of perspectives. Some may see it as yet another example of bad television. You may perceive it as US propaganda that seeks to justify and excuse this nations meddlesome role in the world today. Perhaps you think its entertaining and maybe you feel its political take on things is fair minded. ,2015
1,"The show is so Left leaning it will be a turn-off even to Lefties. It's also ""fairytale"" enough to not be taken seriously. The first episode was hopeful; the second was starting to show it's political colors and this latest episode went full tilt. The casting is good for the most part; not sure about the clandestine relationship going on as it's comical in a serious show. Tea and Tim make a good pair. Before I get told it's just entertainment I want to point out that it should be entertainment for everyone. If one-half of the country will be turned off by the messages it seems a bad business decision. If the producers lighten up on the tons of political messages this could be a watchable show.",2014
4,"I did really enjoy the first few episodes. Just watch it now as background noise & whilst doing other things. A bit to clean cut & America saves the world for me, maybe it's because I'm more a fan of political satire. I think it tries to be serious, but is no way believable.",2017
8,Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human.,2015
8,"""Ex Machina"" deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores what it means to be human.",2015
9,"Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.",2015
9,"This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",2015

9,"Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different.",2015
8,"This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.",2015
6,"Ex Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius, treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor into believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no real challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee, egotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a foregone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When not quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys. Ava just happens to be a spectacular example.",2015

CEO, supposedly genius programmer himself, could not even get to the source of his power outages that happen many times every day. A super-smart programmer confused that he might be a robot himself. An AI that is overly concerned with its own sexuality. An AI that's stupid enough to get away from the power source - it's been constantly charging its batteries while in the house.

First, If you wanted to test a robotic AI to see whether it could fool a human, wouldn't the obvious way to do it be: build it to look completely human, and then have it interact with your unsuspecting human subject? Wouldn't it be much more useful that way, to see whether your human subject figures out that the girl is a robot? And wouldn't it make much more sense to have a psychologist be your human subject?

Its getting a whole lot of positive reviews from people who really should know better, which speaks volumes about the state of film and film criticism today. I was left with one question; right at the beginning the helicopter pilot mentions something about having been flying over a private estate for 2 hours already; so is it possible for a chopper that size to carry enough fuel for a round-trip over 4 hours??

1,"If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house?

1,"One of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling I have ever  seen in my entire life.  ""Gone Girl"" gets its title I think, from the fact that she was supposed  to be done away with (murdered and disposed of) but is really ""gone""  psychologicallyshe is a pure psychopath.  The movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent, and  meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it.  Here's the pathetic execution of her plan:  1. he leaves the house one morning, and she springs into action.   2. she breaks the glass coffee table, pours about a half quart of her  own blood in one puddle, in front of the kitchen sink. That much blood  from a violent attack would be all over the room.   3. she flees, leaving the front door open.   4. A nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband (somehow  the neighbor knows exactly where he is.) But no one saw the wife leave.  5. The husband comes home. He has not a scratch on him.   6. he is totally co-operative with the police.   7. They eventually find her diary In a wood stove at the husbands  father's house. The wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only  partially burned; it really makes you wonder how that played outthat  the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed, all  that work, cleaning up the blood at home, but not to burn the book, as  if he needed to make a special trip to his dad's house to dispose of a  stupid book. and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one  page which he could've simply torn out.   8. When the wife runs away, she only changes her appearance slightly  and then, instead of secluding herself, she makes friends with some  low-lifes, with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on TV.   9. she murders the Neil Harris character in an attempt to switch the  blame to him. That would then imply he was the one that drained so much  blood from her back at her home, he cleaned it up and he put her diary  in the wood stove (?!)   His car wasn't seen at her house.   He then kept her a prisoner, starved and raped her.Yet she found the  opportunity and strength to kill him, but didn't call the police from  his house to come rescue her. rather she jumps in his car and drives  all the way home.   10. upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the  bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged  kidnapper.   11. There is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping  crime scenehouse on the lake.  12. The hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform, underneath which  she is still caked in blood.  This movie is just about the lamest piece of S**** I have ever seen.",2014
1,"Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.",2014

No one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and the hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No flipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense.

1,"Never again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham handed and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the terrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie. At one point my husband turned to me and whispered ""this is really bad"" and we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and recasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin sister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You might love it. I really, really did not.",2014
9,"It's a mistake to recruit the author to do the screenplay - they are too emotionally invested, and if they aren't known for writing scripts the disparity in quality can be obvious. Take The Exorcist III for example. Or Gone Girl.",2014
1,"Actually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck was excellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evil incarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand Luke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and gotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me.",2014
10,"Having read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring to life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne. Her character is so complex, that Rosamund Pike deserves all awards that will be coming to her. She was able to give Amy the mysterious vibe but likable aura of a socialite New Yorker.",2014
8,Two movies for the price of one. ,2014
1,"I wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK, before anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the acting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say that in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid moments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI agents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what I understand was a awful ending.",2014
8,The basic premise is as old as the movies.,2014
10,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",2014
1,As I read through the reviews and view the scores given to this movie by my fellow members I wonder if there is something deeply wrong with my perception. Or if others are drawn in by the ultra hype some movies are given before release and with that expectation start off viewing with rose coloured glasses.,2014
3,"After watching over the first hour of this movie I just couldn't stay interested in any of the characters or even in the plot for that matter. In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not just missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her character and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with cops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too. About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well expressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck going down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they bumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do it, you lose value.",2014
1,"Avoid this couple at all costs - they are very toxic. Gone Girl is a misleading title since Amy is not a girl. She used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named Amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie. In fact she calls herself the C-word. David Fincher has made some of my favorite movies (Fight Club, Zodiac, etc.) but this is not one of my favorites. This movie is all the things I dislike in a movie - tedious, depressing, unlikeable characters, dark photography, moody music, strange casting, smug dialogue. This might work with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but come to think of it - that was no girl either.",2015
4,I have not read the book so I cannot compare this movie with the book. But judging from the fact that Gillian Flynn has also written the screenplay of the movie I trust that the movie has done justice to the book. Which might not be a very good thing to say about the book because I wasn't very impressed with the movie. ,2014
8,"The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.",2015
10,"John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!",2015
7,"It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.",2015
8,"Keanu Reeve is John Wick. He's a deadly and unstoppable hit-man, and it shows. ""John Wick"" is short and to the point, but so much fun. At 1 hour and 36 minutes running time, there is never a dull moment in what may be one of the best action films of the year. ",2014
9,"At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.",2014
9,"John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.",2014
7,"Lesson learned: don't get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick's bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. ",2014
8,The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!,2015
10,"John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.",2014
1,If I could give this piece of crap 0 stars I would. This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even cheesy 80s action movies like Cobra had better writing. ,2015
1,"This was the last time I watched a movie based on IMDb ratings. Seriously. If you are 15 years old , you may watch this pile of... otherwise... Acting sucks, gangsters are brainless idiots, plot is terrible. ""Russian"" language? Hollywood, can you at least once hire OK Russian-speaking people? Hellooo??!! Just ""a few"" notable moments:",2014
1,"Cannot think of anything to redeem this movie. Fight scenes were boring with baddies unable to find their target at 3 feet. An expert as John Wick was supposed to be was unable to fight off 2 thugs and an idiot in his own house. He could shoot every other baddie but when it came to Iosef he kept missing. Why didn't he kill Ms Perkins? What was the significance of the gold coins, or was I too uninterested to catch what it was. Also Willem Dafoe was just a pointless addition, could have put anyone in that part who just wanted to collect a cheque for little contribution. Again Keanu fails to impress, and this was 100 minutes of my life I will not get back. Do yourself a big favour and give it a miss, really.",2015
1,"I do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched this attempt at a film but I will not be imbibing, that's for sure. There are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new cult film, that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc. Sorry but 'fail' is the only word that comes to mind. The gratuitous and total violence is just pathetic and I might say a serious low point in American culture. Keanu has returned! From what? He looks like a very sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can get his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie. I hope that the directors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever making another attempt. Seriously people, if you liked this film then you need to seriously look in the mirror. I mean really! If the mirror don't crack then just be thankful. If I had to find just one redeeming factor I would be very hard pressed. OK - I liked the little dog. YUK!",2014
2,"Based on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from this movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done. Certainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited lives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the ""committee"", but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the end. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and killings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of the film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and excessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation game.",2014
3,My only guide to this movie was IMDb ratings which I'm sorry to say but are either being used ONLY by people with very low standards for movies or are somehow rigged.,2014
1,"Gone are the days when you could trust the internet ratings on rotten-tomatoes, IMDb.. hell even Wikipedia entry is so wrong about its ""reception and critical acclaim""..",2015
2,"First of all, there are obviously two versions of this movie, as reviews sway from ""top notch"" straight to ""low bottom"", deadly missing the golden average. I watched the second version. The movie ""John Wick"" exploits the idea of bad Russians, and how they are put in place by a retired hit-man (John Wick). The plot is extremely straightforward and would be easily fit for a video- or a computer game without any changes. There are no intriguing twists or any interesting supporting characters. Humour is absent completely, but for one small joke. Plenty of music, which has good tempo but a bit loud, as if movie-makers tried to compensate for bland taste with high decibels. ",2014
1,"I thought this was one of the worst films of all-time. I only went to see it because it had an 8.3 rating on IMDb. Wow! It is still rated over 8.0 as we speak. Holy crapamole Batman! This film was boring, lacked ANY character depth, and wasn't amusing or visually interesting. I have literally never been so shocked at the poor quality of a movie script or character development.",2014
1,"I know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie. But still, I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be something wrong.",2014
1,"this movie is a huge joke, i've never seen anything so ridiculous in my life, it's even worse than runnning scared, keanu goes around and kills everyone like he's god incarnate. i mean in the professional, at least jean reno kills them in a very believable fashion, except when he shoots the cops from the ceiling of the room. i mean in this movie, nothing is believable, 30% of the people get head shotted while moving, that's just retarded, and nobody can headshot john wick, nobody can even shoot him in the arm, hands, leg, or feet. in the beginning, they send a commando squad to his house, like 10 people, they are getting killed one by one or two by two. i mean that's so retarded, even if these guys don't know what they are up against, the fact that ten of them are ordered to kill one guy would tell them they are up against someone good. i mean john just kills them one by one and headshots them like its nothing, i mean i can just fire blindly while he's fighting 2 of my buddies and get at least a shot on him, then i'll just empty the clip into him or go in and empty it into his head. there's a scene where the boss leaves 2 goons to take care of john wick who was hand cuffed, after seeing like 50 of their fellow goons headshoted, you figure they wouldn't leave much to chance. but no, they decide to suffocate him to death with a plastic baggie!!! they hardly even tortured him before doing it. and they exposed themselves to open windows. I would've just put 3 shots into his head. john's friend violated the code by helping him when he said he's gonna kill him and he was ratted out by a female assassin, but that earned her death, wtf? what did she do wrong? john's friend violated the code, why can't he be ratted out? I don't even know why the directed bother to give the bad guys a chance, why don't they just bring back neo and keanu can just off them all with his mind and the movie will be 5 seconds long. oh by the way, keanu can't act, i can grab any random people on the street, and chances are they'll be at least as good.",2014

1,"though i usually enjoy more movies where there is a delicate balance between substance and style - the film has an intelligent story and characterization that produces deep emotions, too - i also find great and perhaps a little guilty pleasure watching action films once in a while but this is one of the films in its genre in which i simply do not find anything enjoyable or pleasurable at all. it is totally boring and utterly ridiculous watching experience and i only wonder why on earth it was ever even made in the first place? there is NOTHING original. everything has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of other movies...",2015
1,"Cannot believe how weak and pathetic this movie was. I was expecting at least a plausible story line and gripping action with Keanu Reeves in it. But Reeves acting was SO shallow and unbelievable, as was everyone else's. The plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a repeat of so many other movies. The action was stiff and repetitive, and absolutely lacking in reality. The story was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous, and the concept of Reeves being able to do even a small portion of what he was pictured to do, was just absurd. Can hardly believe actors of Reeve's caliber could even consent to act in this B-grade rubbish. It's like a kid's movie - all impossibility and fantasy. Nothing gripped me at all, not for a moment. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",2015
1,"I bet it would be a great movie but unfortunately I pressed stop after a couple of minutes. The first scene was about John Wick who loses his wife and he is sad and angry. Second scene his dead wife sends him a present which was a puppy for him to take care and love (how sweet and sad). Third scene some creepy guys break into his home cause earlier they wanted to buy his car but John did not sale it to them. So because the movie wasn't so tragic and dramatic all ready you probably thought that something was missing. What about killing the puppy? Of course you killed the puppy and you made the movie worth watching now (or not). To sum up, a wife dies, he is depressed, violent guys want to kill him for his car and because there is not enough drama already they kill the puppy. What a start! I wonder if after that John Wick becomes Hit Man and tries to get revenge for his puppy's death driving his car!! Thank you and sorry",2015
9,"This series developed from the masterfully gloomy movie of the same title puts Italian production up close and center. This is very well crafted, with a impressive camera precision even though it's within the Gritty-style of modern cinema. Here and there you'll see some very inventive camera directing (a motorcycle-crash comes close to the best vehicle-scene I have seen since the first ""Mad Max""). It is a rough and gray view of mob-crime in a dystopia Italy, but even though the setting is the same ghetto as the movie ""Gomorra"" the social-realism of the movie is toned down by the producers, in order for a more character-driven narrative to emerge - that is good. This is a brilliant authentic-Italian and promising series, that recalls Sergio Leones ""Once upon a time in America"" just without wide angel and widescreen. And again it contains some of the technically best non-computer generated action-sequences I have seen since Michael Mann. BRAVO! Forza Italia! from Denmark.",2014
10,This is without a doubt in my mind the greatest show at the moment. You really get a good look into the world of organized crime in Naples and it it comes without any Hollywood clichés. The acting is on point and the scenery consisting of real footage from the Scampia area in Naples gives you a feeling of being there. ,2014
10,"In my opinion this is an absolutely brilliant TV-series. In the beginning you get to know the characters and the Mafia business in general, but as the series develop you get a deeper insight into all the personalities, their psychology, the choices that they make and how/why their actions lead to all kinds of different sequences of events that are tragic, sad, action packed, exciting and entertaining. ",2014
9,A very well-made TV series about the Camorra mafia in Naples. The director is not holding back on the dirty and gruesome details that classifies this organization. I must say that i'm very impressed with the crew shooting the series at the actual drug-ghetto as their location of choice. It gives a more authentic feel to the viewer. If you haven't seen the movie Gomorrah from 2008 i must recommend that you see it first. But i do feel that the 2014 series is of much better standards. ,2014
10,"This is without doubt one of the best TV series I have ever seen – and that is without exaggeration. Although there has only been one season up to now this by far exceeds The Sopranos, The Wire and dare I say it Breaking Bad. Many a TV series starts off too slow – well this is not one of them. We get action from the get go and this only increases up until the end – where we get a magnificent finish. The storyline is great and the acting is superb. We really get to see the characters develop and the transformation of Genny is brilliantly displayed. I just hope the second season is as good as the first – because the first was great.",2015
10,"On flicking through the TV one night I stumbled onto this at Episode 8 (I learned later). I'm not a big fan of subtitled series, but I found the lead role's mohawk haircut interesting enough to keep me tuned in for longer than usual. The rest is history. Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman. This is a must-own series for all gangster movie/TV series buffs, and the great thing about it is, not a lot of people know just how mind-blowingly brilliant it is.",2014
10,"For a pure casualty it happened I've watched this TV series just after I've finished a marathon of The Wire (five season in about a month). I can say the Authors of Gomorra have surely studied The Wire and the narrative in Gomorra in sometimes freely inspired to the BAltimore gangs. The POV in Gomorra is focused from the side of the Savastano Clan, missing the police work shown in the Wire. But Gomorrah offers a deeper experience of how a large criminal organization works, showing the tentacles of the Kraken shaking society, politics, enterprises and elections in the Naples area. The shooting technique is modern and thorough: it is quite evident the shooting crew hadn't all the money involved in a USA or UK serial, but the results are impressive anyway.",2014
10,"I began watching this as I remembered watching the film and reading the Saviano book a few years ago. Both are excellent, but I feel the series is quite different and is perhaps only loosely based on the original source material. But that didn't bother me; this is a superb series. I found myself so immersed in the characters, the setting and the whole world that I had to keep reminding myself while I was at work that I wasn't a Neapolitan gangster. Every episode of the series is different, the characters are all so compelling and some of the twists and turns are gut-wrenching. Every episode ends perfectly and each one makes you feel differently - one made me weep with sentiment, another took me to such a dark place that I considered not watching any more because I realised ""even the good guys are really really bad guys"". But I'm glad I continued watching because the end of the series is phenomenal and makes me hungry for more. I have been truly blown away (excuse the pun) by this series and can pick no faults with it at all...and if you don't agree with me, I know some guys who know where you live and might be able to ""change your mind""! Also acting - amazing. All the actors are spot on. Special mention for Vincenzo Sacchettino (Danielino) who has got to be one of the best teenage actors I've seen for a long while.",2015
10,"Make no mistake, Gomorra is no copycat version of some other gangster film or series; it is the evolution of the genre, something we haven't seen perhaps since Un Prophète (2009) by Jacques Audiard.",2016
10,"I have just watched episode 2 and I am addicted. Was not sure what to expect, I had not heard of the book or the 2008 film of the same name. After 10 minutes I could tell it was going to be well made, the setting in Naples in Italy ,the home of the camorra crime family,(changed to Gamorra by the author) and the base of the story came from a book written by Roberto savino , who lived in Naples. I say lived because at the moment he has had to move away with a bodyguard for all the fuss he has caused. His book was a best seller but that did not go down well with everyone especially the local mafia he wrote about. According to Savino the camorra nor dwarf""s the mafia of Sicily.In the first episode we get to meet the crew and family and are soon in the backstreet""s where deals are done and beatings are dished out. The story keeps you hooked ,although everything is spoken in Italian with English subtitles I instantly got into the show and remarked to a friend it was like watching a documentary rather than actors.The second episode carries on the excitement mixed with excellent acting and a strong script. I cant wait for episode 3, and would give a IMDb score of 9/10",2014
10,"I just finished watching Season 2 of Gomorrah, and it is just as good--if not better--than the excellent first season. This has the potential to be as great as Breaking Bad and The Wire, if the next two seasons sustain the dramatic power of the first two.",2016
10,"Maybe this is one of the best TV shows ever made in the history of television. The characters, the tempo, the music, Napoles and the writing is outstanding. This show is a piece of part that almost everybody just found on internet by mistake looking for other movies or something. This show is based in the book ""Cero,Cero,Cero"" of Roberto Saviano and its represented in the show very well by all the characters. If you're a lover of mob and thriller movies or shows you will not be disappointed with Gomorra. Nothing less, I absolutely recommend this show for all the people that are tired of the empty and unrealistic shows that Hollywood make this days. The beauty of Gomorra is that only few people know about this show and you can recommend the series to a friend and everyone will love the show. Amazing.",2016
8,"A seriously great show. Don't let subtitles make you not bother to watch this. As good as any American show. With interesting characters, Shocking twists and a great story. ",2014
10,Simply put: Gomorra is fantastic.,2015
10,"excellent and well made series,the other one that comes to this level  is breaking bad,where ruthlessness and murder become options in  life.every time you read the newspaper about some murder related to  street crime,this explains that reality.all the characters are well  setup and inclusive to the plot of the series,nothing is left to  chance,every move and action is well thought out,with no holding back  in any situation,from a talk to a murder,you never know what's  coming,and that is what brings a series to a different level.breaking  bad had that,and Gomorrah also has  that.goodfellas,godfather,sopranos...etc,you could see everything  coming,here,not really.who expected malamore to kill ciro's daughter?  not me,but they took it there,when ciro kills don pietro,i was certain  he would wait and kill malamore also,not so.because,if they would've  done that,then they would have made a TV show,now they are making  reality.",2016
10,"After viewing TV series all my life, i can honestly say that this is the best TV show ever made!",2016
10,"We have never left feedback for anything we have watched and we have never felt the urge too (even being a avid 24 fans), but having just watched the first series of this, we felt completely compelled to get on our keyboard and share our thoughts.",2015
10,"If you have seen shows such as Peaky Blinders, Breaking Bad, Fargo, Boardwalk Empire and particularly The Sopranos then you must watch Gomorrah.",2017
10,"without a doubt the best crime series ever made. coming from a background of being Italian and an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of such a tale,the realism is beyond belief. no sugar coating and extremely raw footage along with authentic dialogue and dialect from the region. if you get a chance to watch it with or without subtitles do yourself a favor and watch it from beginning to end. gritty as the wire and filmed on location in Naples. gives an inside look at the inner workings of a major mafia family ,id say rivals if not surpasses the Sopranos.no other show has the depth of character and realism that the producers and directors have managed to bring forth camera work and attention to detail is second to none",2016
9,"We don't get to see this area of Italy much in films. In Gomorrah, we find ourselves in the ghetto--the projects--towering blocks of concrete crammed with small apartments festooned with the laundry out on the balcony. Surrounded by blatant drug traffic out in the open but protected by lookouts who'll yell ""Mario"" is they see a cop car. First impressions? Wow! The dealers take care of business without much police interference. You don't see any cops doing stop and frisk or harassing the poor or committing fearing for their lives executions. These criminal gangs have more reason to be scared of rival gang members who aren't beyond burning them out of their homes or cutting their throats. The rewards may be great but you'll have a short life. ",2016
9,"The Godfather Trilogy, especially the third chapter, despite the grisly subject matter, revels in La Bella Italia. Brutal assassinations are interspersed with scenes of sleepy Sicilian village life, big bowls of pasta and immaculate tailoring. Gomorrah is the flip of the coin, filmed on a brutalist public housing district in the north of Napoli. ",2017
10,"a true depiction of gang life, very real, very raw. i had mixed emotions about the first season, i wished the series went in a direction more favorable to the lead actor, 2nd in command Ciro. however, it went the way it did and major drama, betrayal and violence was the result, making it addicting to watch. the acting of each character, big or small was truly believable, each scene made you feel as if you were a part of the story; as part of the gang or an innocent bystander. the series had many characters, in some shows it would be too many, but the way the story was told each character no matter how important their role, made you feel for their individual situations and each character was crucial to the unfolding of events. i felt the acting, plot, set, characters,and cinematography all added up to create an excellent show.",2017
10,"I am impressed all the time by the shots and cannot tell exactly why. It is better shot than most movies. This series should be watched in a cinema. You can say about the Italians what you want but they sure know how to make things beautiful, cars, fashion, music, art, I love it all. I saw series one and two and I had my doubts about the acting in series one but in two it is exceptionally good, everyone is spot on. My favorite is Trak, a guy you love to hate. It's all slow and fast at the same time. I have seen people shot a million times on screen but never as impressive and brutal. When I am watching I am out of my own reality, totally sucked into it in a unique way, never experienced it before like this. I am afraid it does not get any better than this and I am sad it is over for now.",2017
10,"I was blown away by this show. I have never watched a subtitled show before (apart from Lillyhammer, but it was part subs) but this one really grips you. A very violent, gritty drama series that delves right into the murky world of the Italian Mafia. The loyalty, the double crossing, the murder, the violence, this has just about everything in a plot that flows seamlessly from scene to scene. If you can get this on box set, watch it you won't be disappointed.",2017
8,"I am writing this review because I find it utterly unbelievable that people take Black-ish literally. The show is obviously satirical. It's making fun of the idea that society believes that there is a certain connotation to blackness or, put simply, certain behaviors and beliefs are considered ""black"". As an upper class black individual who lives in a white neighborhood, I get it. Because of the color of my skin, I'm supposed to ""act black"" and black friends find it weird that I ""talk white"". The show is basically Dre making fun of the fact that being black is more than having a skin color; it comes with expectations and stereotypes that many black people feel the need to embody because if they don't, they won't be authentically black. It is not being racist. It is raising stereotypes, but in a comical way that is supposed to make watchers really question the validity of them. It's a comedy and you're supposed to laugh at Dre's nonsensical obsession about not being black enough. I think the problem is people fail to recognize satire, not just in Black-ish but in any context, such as articles online, commentators always take it literal. ",2015
7,Normally I don't go to the trouble of writing a review but in this case I had to. Reading the other reviews you'd think this was directed by Malcolm X. It's amazing how offended people can get by a black character (yes he's a character and one of the few) on TV. Do these reviewers who were so utterly offended by this character ever stop to wonder what the black community thinks of white TV? Which is to say almost all TV.,2014
9,"Like some other reviewers here, when I watched the first episode, I turned it off after about ten minutes. It's an unfortunate pilot that leads viewers to think that the entire show will be a narrow diatribe on ""blackness"". But the show is titled ""Black-ish"" and it is appropriately titled.",2014
10,"First of all those who are offended by the title of the show should just pipe down and realize that the creators where just being satirical. As a black man I find the over abundance of buffoonish television shows that are typically geared towards African Americans to be passe and very stereotypical. Tyler perry based shows like Meet the Browns and House of Pain, though well meaning in their portrayal of the Black experience, often suffer from poor writing ( a habitual issue with Tyler Perry productions) and out of date tropes and production values. These shows are typically successful due to Mr. Perry's built in audience and,quiet simply ,a scarcity of programming geared towards black viewers. What makes Blackish stand out is its strong writing, perfectly cast lead actors( Anthony Anderson and Lawrence Fishburn's chemistry is particularly impressive), and irreverent look at the issues facing an upper class black family. Obviously some may not ""get"" some of the humor if you are unfamiliar with the nuances of black culture, just as an African American might not get every funny referrence from ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". The vast majority of the show, however, deals with issues that anyone can relate too. I'm 3 episodes in, and like most good shows, Blackish gets funnier the longer the writers have time to flesh out the characters and progress with the story lines. One more note. In no way is this show racist like some misguided and ignorant reviewers ( with some admitting to having only watched 15 minutes of the pilot...talk about ADHD) suggest. To those individuals I would say give it an actual chance. Check out the first 3 episodes on ONdemand before you pass a hasty judgement on such a small sample size",2014
9,"Despite what many people are saying about Blackish, it is not a racist show and it is not even a show about race. It is in fact a family show and it is a family show about culture. In the first episode it does come off as too, but by the end it comes off in a good way, many people must not have watched or didn't finish. Despite that, it delivers great laughs all through the way. The 2nd episode was more of a representation of what the show really is, which is a family show. The second episode again delivers the laughs, but it does it in a very creative and fresh way, and it also did not use anything racial at all. For obvious reasons people will not give this show a chance and they really should. Blackish is a funny and creative show, about family and culture. This successful family is living in the suburbs and adopting that culture, to the dismay of the father. Its laughs all the way through, as these parents, try to be great parents, not so much on culture, but family.",2014
9,"This series might not start off great, but it has certainly won me over. Despite its title, it doesn't make everything about race (in fact deals little with race at all), but instead skillfully and hilariously considers how self-identification and values change trans-generationally. I did not give the show a 10 star rating since it still needs a little work. It's already one of my favorites and I believe it has the potential to be a great family sitcom. I believe the lower rating it has received here has little to do with the quality of the show and more to do with human tendency to categorize and then refuse to see beyond preconceptions.",2014
1,"Sad and very disappointing. I have always enjoyed Anthony Anderson. but this is pure racist garbage, unfunny crap. With all the BS going on in the real world why would a show meant to be a comedy, push at stereotypes and racist material.. yeah black people can be and are quite racist just as any other race So why continue to push this separation.. this show should be yanked, better shows have been yanked for less, hell his last show ""guys with kids"" was totally funny this one Sucks. You think that in 2014 we as a Nation and people might have come a little further along and Stop playing this boring and destructive race card.",2014
2,"OK, back up, back up now. Is Black-ish trying to be the new Cosby Show or something along those lines? Whether it is or it isn't, I still don't see the appeal of this show and I'm already in episode 5. One, Blackish isn't funny. Two, Blackish recycles humour but delivers it badly, therefore, making it not funny. Three, the show is borderline racist, not just to black people, to people in general. Anthony Anderson is a great actor, he's a funny guy, great chemistry in front of the camera and clearly the only reason this show is tolerable. Along with Laurence Fishburne, these two are the only two people I enjoy watching. As for Tracee Ellis Ross, in all honesty, her role is pretty damn annoying. It's My Wife and Kids all over again, where mom tries very hard to connect with her teenage daughter and tries to look cool so her younger daughter looks up to her. While we're on the subjects of daughters, when did it become funny to see young kids be sarcastic, rude, back-talk and too big for their own shoes? Plus this little girl carries it out with terrible acting skills. And again, when was it funny to see teenage girls with constant mood swings hating on their parents? No parent finds that funny. This whole scene, has been done over and over again. The difference with Blackish is that it's delivered extremely poorly, thus making it unbearable to watch. It's a terrible sitcom honestly. I'm amazed it's been given a full season's run.",2014
1,"This show used to be creative and genuinely funny. I looked forward to every episode, told friends about it, and my husband and I loved it.Now it is over the top racist and political...as if we don't get enough of this in every day life. Newspapers, the internet and all media are so dang negative all the time, I watch comedy TV shows to smile, laugh, and escape reality, for just one half hour. The election is over, whether you like the results or not, stop spending time and energy complaining about the situation and find the best in it. Your skin color is just that, it is not your character, morals and values. This show was a fantastic idea with humorous appeal to blacks....and whites...purples, greens and blues. You had created a good thing, and you successfully ruined it. I USED to watch this show.",2017
4,"This show can easily be summed up: A dad hates being stereotyped by everyone in society and comes home at the end of the day and complains to his entire family that they don't act black enough.... but then he doesn't like people judging him for his skin color.... but wants his family to act black and that just goes in circles and circles and circles. Yes, that is the entire show. ",2014
1,"the show is racist plain and simple. to say its not a show about race is a lie. its about a man who think his family is assimilating to well into white culture and are not being black enough. the problem is...THERE IS NO BLACK ENOUGH... black is your race (your social category) it has nothing to do with your social status, culture, personality, or behavior. cheep stereo-type after another. if a black man grows up in japan is he not a black man? who ever thought of this trash is extremely lacking in creativity and is just trying to make money and obtain publicity and ratings from the hot topic of race in America. stupid 1/10 stars id give it less if possible.",2014
1,"Blackish has a simple message, that you must subscribe to and embrace clichés about your race or you are betraying your own kind. The message is an unfortunate one because the implication is that conforming to stereotypes is desirable. One has heard the arguments against assimilation but instead being aware of one's roots while pursuing one's individuality the solution offered by the show is enforcing stereotypes. There is also the unfortunate message that acquiring wealth and its attendant possessions makes young Americans white as though there weren't legitimate black avenues of self expression at the upper echelons. It caters to and encourages the perpetuation of stereotypes of black people. This is the second time, the first being in 'Girlfriends', that Ms. Ross has acted in a show that does this. Why in every project she participates in is blackness synonymous with a lack of manners. This show does not represent any race positively and sends a terrible message. Not recommended for adults but particularly not for impressionable children.",2014
1,"The concept of defining behaviors and characteristics based on race is distasteful. The dialogue and situations in this show not only teach racism to the younger audience but show them that it is acceptable. It's appalling that ABC, a family driven network, would back a show with such writing as this. Even the name is poorly chosen; to have a show grow its audience individual s have to be able to openly talk about it. Black-ish is not a word most will fell comfortable using loosely in day to day conversations. Black-ish is also counterproductive in the journey to race equality. It is my hope that ABC will take measures to right this wrong, whether by directing the writers to a more conscientious script or pulling the show altogether.",2014
3,"I was looking forward to this show until it actually started. I made it 15 minutes into the show before I decided that this was a waste of time. The characters seem really flat and unauthentic. The interactions are very fast-paced and over scripted--way over scripted. The characters are not believable. They seem dull and the conversations and interactions are cliché. The family is not believable as a family--way too superficial of interactions yet again and the workplace is also not believable. The writing just really is not good and the acting leaves a lot to be desired as well. It's simply a superficial, rich, contrived family living in a superficial, contrived, rich neighborhood. Don't we have enough of those shows? Where's ""Roseanne"" when you need her?",2014
6,A few weeks ago I wrote this review. In it I was critical of racial plot lines that could be offensive or at least annoying to some viewers. I stated that I was one of the viewers that was occasionally put-off by these racial plot lines but that overall I liked the series.,2017
10,I enjoy every bit of this Sitcom.. it pokes fun at life in general and also teaches me valuable life lessons about how easy it is as human beings to misunderstand each other.,2015
9,"The first episode took me completely by surprise! It was so funny. Yes, the white people in it are a bit of a caricature (Seriously, one advertiser asks Dre how (whispered) ""black"" people would say good morning) but maybe they're the same type of off from a black perspective that black people often are when portrayed from a white perspective.",2014
7,"I'm not going to lie to you, when I heard Anthony Anderson was in this I thought it was going to be trash. If just because I see him as the cheaper Wayne Brady. Though it is mostly because I don't know what his shtick is as a comedian and never found him funny. However, with the inclusion of Laurence Fishburne, who has yet to do me wrong as an actor, and Tracee Ellis Ross, who I haven't seen in a series since Girlfriends, since I ignored the other show she had, I figured they could balance out Anderson, if not make all my worries go away. Read below to see if they did.",2014
1,"I'm sorry but I feel I need to review this show after having watched modern family and then losing the remote. This show Blackish comes on after two great shows, The Goldbergs and Modern Family and it definitely doesn't deserve to be show after those other shows. Like I said I was watching Modern Family and lost the remote and was forced to hear the first ten minutes of this awful show. The cast is terrible, just awful, especially the kids and grandpa and the wife and the husband and pretty much anybody on the show. The jokes are horrible awkward and really forced into the wrong places at the wrong times. I hope producers come to there senses and stop trying to ""modernize"" all of these new shows coming out by saying dozens of inappropriate jokes about things like for example in the first ten minutes I watched the husband and wife were talking about what seemed to be a normal topic about the wife having a gray hair but then out of nowhere she goes to look in the mirror at her head but wait, the gray hair was not on her head, nor was it on her face or any other appropriate place. No, it was in the souther area above the knees but below the waist. That's right, they were conversing about a women going gray on her privates. This show is a great example of why the sitcom is increasingly losing popularity as the years go by. Please take this off the air and go back to making shows like Family Ties. It's OK to have a little edge in you shows like for example, Roseanne or Married with children. But there is a line and this show, like many other new sitcoms have crossed the line from being funny crude to over doing being dirty and awkward ""potty mouth"" jokes to the point where it's not funny and has a bad influence on the younger crowd watching.",2015
1,"I wish I could rate this show lower than ""1"".",2015
3,"Somebody else mentioned this, but I think it's worth repeating. The world really doesn't need a show like this. There are enough racial stereotypes and racially inflammatory problems in real life, it's counterproductive to make a show about it. Very poor taste and, with those things in mind, the show just simply isn't funny. I don't even need to point out how racially offensive it would be to have a show called ""White-ish"", so why is it OK to have a show called Black-ish? It's not, but certain people believe that it's OK to hold one side of a racial divide on a pedestal because of past hardships.",2014
10,"After all these years, it is nice to see a TV network finally go forward and present a show like this. ",2014
7,"I love the NCIS shows. Entertaining characters, diverse and textured scenery. I like that the writers sometimes come up with a plot that I haven't seen or read in any variation before. ",2017
2,I live in Australia and saw only up to the third episode. I love NCIS and like NCIS LA very much.,2014
6,"As a New Orleans native I implore you and the writers to walk down any street in New Orleans and talk to a LOCAL. We DO NOT eat shrimp and grits for breakfast and praline bacon isn't in our fridge. We have worked very hard to come back from Katrina and it PAINS ME that this series (which I love and watch regularly) is making us look like uneducated loud mouth pigs. Please - come uptown and take a census of LOCALS, have a LOCAL help you with the dialect!! We DO NOT talk like that unless your're from Mississippi. PLEASE! I LOVE my city and would LOVE for the series to continue and for us New Orleanians to sound like the intelligent up and coming tech community that we are! Thank you!",2014
2,"I knew that there was going to be (is) a NO spin off, but I was so dreadfully disappointed in this. I have just watched the two-part launch in series 11 of NCIS, and the only character who was believable was the wonderful CCH Pounder. The characterisation and sympathetic background was laid on with a trowel. You need to allow characters to develop, to grow up, not be born complete. The parallels stretched the audience's tolerance (the Abbi, the Ducky (although, as I said, CCH was great), the new girl...)and insult their intelligence. And even in England, we appreciate what New Orleans went through with Katrina, but to mention several times how much these characters had done or suffered because of it, in the opening of a series, belittles the genuine suffering of the people of that iconic city. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, but this was so disappointing, I cannot help but say so.",2015
3,This was one of the best shows on TV. Emphasis on the was. And the reason? The introduction of Vanessa Ferlito into the show.,2017
1,I love NCIS and Los Angeles is decent (except for the Deets/Kensie nonsense). But this NO show is abysmal. Need we be reminded every 3.2 seconds that they are in N'ahlens?,2014
2,"I am a huge NCIS fan, and I have even found NCIS: LA entertaining. But seriously.... NCIS: NO is a huge let down! Being a southern girl myself, I tried to like it. I forced myself to watch the first 3 or 4 episodes, but finally had enough and turned it off. I am a huge fan of mystery, crime, etc., but NCIS: NO has horrible writers! I know it isn't the actors because I have loved other shows they have done. I was a huge fan of Quantum Leap!! I feel that the writers seem to think that since this is a show set in the south that those interested in it must be from the south, so therefore, they need to slow down the pace so we can keep up! I actually felt like I was losing brain cells watching! This has the potential to be a great show, if you had decent writers!!! Go back to the drawing board and speed up the pace, or this NCIS will be a bust!",2014
5,"Sad to say, as a fan of both NCIS and the charm and culture and cuisine of N'awlins, I'm VERY disappointed in NCIS New Orleans. I'll admit my opinion is biased by the 11 years I spent in the military, which gives me certain expectations about organizations like NCIS or Army CID, where they work, and the people - civilian and military - that work there. I have two major problems with both NCIS NO and NCIS LA. First, there is no sense of ""place"" in NCIS NO or NCIS LA. NCIS HQ in Virginia is a well defined brick building, and Gibb's house is Gibb's house. The NCIS (Virginia) office space is a well-defined ""bull pen"" with dividers, and team members have assigned space in a realistic office setting. There is an elevator between lower levels of the building (Abby's lab and Duckie's domain,) Gibb's team space, and the Director's office. There is a video teleconference room, an interrogation room, and other realistic looking work spaces. I almost believe I could show people around the building - BUT in both NCIS LA and NO - there is no clearly defined team work space that looks like anything I've ever seen in a military organization - people wander about giant lofts or industrial sets with no evident connection to their work - to include the Navy O-6 (Captain) commanding USN operations in the city! Does Pride offer breakfast to his team in his office (an industrial loft) or his residence (also an industrial loft?)I just can't suspend that much disbelief. Is there a kitchen in the office or does he hold team meetings at home? Quien sabe? They might as well be on the Good Ship Lollipop. The second problem is, Gibbs as Special Agent in Charge has set the bar VERY high. From the very first episode, the guy exuded ""command presence,"" as does Rocky Carroll as Director Vance. Nobody on either NCIS LA or NO has that quality - and if it's not demonstrated at the onset of a command relationship, it's unlikely to emerge later. Again, I just can't suspend enough disbelief to take either of the spin-offs seriously - but I LOVE the old original NCIS (with a few minor reservations.) Aside from these issues, the NCIS N.O.production values are excellent - but the plot twists in the opening episode created another challenging level of disbelief based on improbable coincidences among the victim, the NCIS team, and the perpetrator. Sayonara, NCIS N.O.!",2014
9,"I really was glad to see this show, so I am going to have to keep focused on the review, and not the ""Fan boy crap"". I will get right to it, NCIS has been a solid show in the top 5 since it was first launched, and the LA version has done well with the older crowds, but there has been a lack of real darkness, and this will be the right place to look for the darkest of dark, to be more like Criminal Minds. The Bijou the swamps, and the Parishes are always fun for those of us who only go there to party, and with the success of True Detective this year this show was a forgone conclusion. Now the cast is extremely robust, packed tight with real acting heavy weights, Everyone loves Scott Bakula, and Lucas Black the kid from Sling Blade has never had a bad performance, though he has never been anyone beyond the Alabama boy that he is. CCH Pounder was the conscience of The Shield, so she will be a great Coroner. So far what they have shown us is quality, and that CBS is giving them the room they need to make quality drama. If you like NCIS, or Criminal Minds, then you will be hooked on this one as fast as you can smell the bait. This is the right time for a show of this kind to be on network TV, don't expect any language, but there should still be some nice edge.",2014
2,"where to begin...hmmmi normally I don't write reviews , but this time i had to do it , cause we are talking about NCIS people !! i am a huge fan of NCIS series, but this one i will for sure skip.. Acting was so lame,i was almost falling a sleep during the show..{jazz New Orleans, and Scott Bakula ( for gods sake CPT Archer you can do better than this} Lets make some comparison to NCIS /NCIS LA...even on a boring episodes ..they make me smile , with one liners, or Gibbs slap on the head , Dinozzos film references,Hetty's crap , Hanna, G , Deeks ,Abby , Mc Geek en rest .. I really really was hoping for more from the pilot ... The pilot is there the crucial point where u catch the audience, make us wait for next episode , keep me on the edge , and not make me watch bedtime story ... I give it 2 * only cause i am {was} a fan of Capt Archer....",2014
3,"This series, in the opinion of a huge fan of NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles, is simply pitiful. The writing, especially in the pilot and the first two episodes, is weak and puerile, so weak is the plot line and dialog, that they felt it necessary early on to drag in Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherley, Pauley Perrette , David McCallum and Rocky Carroll to prop up far-fetched story lines, like a Baton Rouge doctor starting an epidemic of bubonic plague. And their presence didn't help at all! As a New Orleanian I rapidly grow tired of Scott Bakula's character's constant references to Hurricane Katrina and how this ""great city"" has suffered enough. The audience has suffered enough already! The entire premise for this show is weak from the git-go -- I am sure that the Navy Department has more important cities which have NCIS departments that could be a better basis for a series than this decrepit river town of less than 400,000 residents. I give it barely 3 stars, out of a sense of compassion to all involved.",2014
2,I get that money runs the world but NCIS:NO... is the one they shouldn't have done.,2014
3,"I am a die-hard NCIS fan and was stoked that Mark Harmon was producing this spin-off. Unfortunately, that's about as far as it goes. NCIS: New Orleans pales in comparison to the original and NCIS: LA and for this I blame the very, very, very bad writing. Another irritant is the artificial/fake New Orleans/Southern accents the actors use (actually jarring to the ear). It's bad enough that they use the NCIS character lineup formula (Gibbs-Dinozzo-McGee-Ziva-Abby-Ducky) but couldn't they have come up with something different, a twist, perhaps? (maybe a forensics team composed of newbies/trainees so the audience is educated along with the forensics team as they go about their duties, or taking it a step further and showing us the legal aspect after the cat and mouse section) ANYTHING! except the current sub-standard copycat production that it is now.",2014
1,"NCIS: NOLA is awful. I've seen better acting from Chuck Norris, better accents from Nicholas Cage and more enjoyable action scenes in ""Batman and Robin"".",2014
10,Donald P. Bellisario does it again. Beautifully done. NCIS New Orleans makes me want to watch and see what happens next. Nice introduction and expansion of new characters as well as the expansion of existing known characters. As always doesn't disappoint with the history of characters and their development within the NCIS. I think this show displays only the best in screen writing. NCIS New Orleans really expands and broadens character area and ext. screenwriter's aspect. NCIS New Orleans is so worth any high budget external location filming endeavor. Brings us back int. to what we expect and know out of existing locations and characters. NCIS New Orleans also is developing a pretty awesome int. view aspect of a NCIS New Orleans office. While I have no idea of future intent of the producers; I'm hopeful the producers expand this show to an NCIS New Orleans full season. I want to see more.,2014
2,"As a dedicated fan of NCIS...both original and Los Angeles...I just can't say how disappointed and appalled I am that the crew who has put out such quality work in writing and acting over the years has dropped the ball so badly with this version. The writing is banal and boring, the acting is wooden, and even the action is limp. It's hard to believe that the only thing it has going for it is New Orleans. It's not enough.",2014
8,"I grew up in New Orleans and I'm an avid NCIS fan, so I was interested to see how they would handle the Crescent City episodes. Overall, I think it did really well. 8 points out of 10.",2014
1,"I met Scott Bakula when he arrived in Los Angeles when he was represented .as he states in his Wikipedia biography, by Henderson/Hogan. Although I had some reservations about his potential in Hollyweird, he proved me wrong. I have watched his career with great anticipation as he has grown and proved what a fine multi-talented actor he is. I especially enjoyed the scene in Boston Legal where he plays the piano and sings to Candace Bergen. All this brings me to why they have cast him in what could be a fine spin-off of NCIS, except for the fact that they have surrounded him with a cast of no talents that made the two episodes thus far so painful to watch. Not everyone...but the caliber of some leave much to be desired. The young lady, in my opinion, sounds like she didn't get past Acting 101. Whoever did the casting should be put out to pasture. I wish the series success, but I wont be watching any more episodes.",2014
1,"I've been a fan of the original NCIS for five years. I bought and watched the first four seasons and try never to miss Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Abby, etc. But this New Orleans spin-off is such a disappointment! I think it's primarily the characters: Everybody is patterned after the original team, but they do not have the same appeal. Not one of them is very interesting, at all convincing, and there's no real chemistry among them. I hate the fake Southern accents, can't stand the crazy lab guy trying to be a male Abby. The female ME is sometimes interesting, but nobody compares with Ducky. And the story lines in most episodes are too predictable. Not that hard to figure out in advance... I usually watch the first few minutes each week but almost always turn it off before the end. Especially didn't like the ""two husbands' story this past week, and turned that one off even quicker than usual.",2015
1,"When it comes to NCIS New Orleans......Scott Bakula is not the one you want in the lead or in the show. His acting does not have the ability for the lead role for this show. His acting, isn't. When he ""TRIES"" to show emotion, it is really bad. Instead of being a leader like Mark Harmon, he does not come across as a leader, but more so arrogant. Someone needs to step in and recast the head for the NCIS New Orleans team. On the second note Zoe McLellan is a breathe of fresh air. She adds color to the show. A bright face that can be used at later times showing the stress of the job or of the horror of the crime. She has a wide latitude of acting abilities that can be used to play on the audience. CCH Pounder is great for her role, again ability to go the distance and keep the audience listening for her advice. Lucas Black, he's new, still working on his fit into the program, but getting a good feeling about what he can do for the show. Bottom line, the show needs an anchor and it is not Scott Bakula. As they say just before they shoot you in a movie, ""nothing personal"". Would just like to see the show succeed.",2015
2,"I feel sorry for this show, especially for the most talented actors taking part in the most horrifying writing. Did you know that that Dr. portrayed by CCH POUNDER was talent in the show called The Shield, I never guessed she would take part in such crap. The writers seem to focus more on Scott Bacula's character , in my point, that senseless Hollywood writing, well can't write a good episode so lets drag this guy on the spotlight for an hour. I wish Mark Harmon gets over with the grudge against NCIS Los Angeles executive director and give them their Tuesday spot back. I think the NCIS dynasty is about to end, because I'm so sick of it, there are better shows out there giving more action and open up the characters more. The cast choice was all over from the top though.",2015
1,"I can't stand it anymore. As a show that links events in the US Navy as part of its plot, you'd think they would hire competent consultants to review the script. The last episode was so awful, had so many mistakes, for sure I'll never try this series again. First, an USN Captain would never be outside without his hat (cover). The plane crashes because of a sudden nose down condition, out of control. Six G's, they say, maybe, but they would be NEGATIVE G's, completely different. The pilot is mostly intact and sitting in the cockpit. Not likely again. The body would be in a thousand pieces, put in baggies. I had to walk away at this point. Simply awful.",2015
2,"I am a huge Bellisario fan. Magnum, JAG, NCIS and NCIS: LA. are some of my favorite shows of all time. Therefore, I greatly disappointed with the 2 episodes on NCIS that introduced the New Orleans franchise. The acting was horrible. Could Lucas Black's character been any more stereotypical of a 'dumb southerner'? I mean, seriously? Lego pieces under a laptop's keys? Having an NCIS office that was trashed and in an old warehouse? I've seen better line delivery in high school plays. I really expected more of Scott Bakula too. His character came off as silly & shallow. The constant ""My brother"" was just lame. And what kind of agent goes into the main suspect's apartment and totally ignores there are steps leading to an upstairs before declaring ""all clear""? The only character I actually liked was Doctor Loretta Wade. Zoe McLellan did a good job with her part, as well. Even though I wasn't super interested in the NCIS: Red Team they introduced last year on NCIS: LA, it was definitely better than this. My husband and teenage son agreed, we'd never bother watching an episode if they go forward with New Orleans.",2014
4,"Yawn. Someone ordered ""Pilot of the pilot fish""? Pilot fish survive only by feeding from the leftovers of larger fish they follow.",2014
10,"OK, it has it's flaws, it has fictional characters united with the real ones, yeah, it is using the ""pirates hype"", but MY GOD, it is a good show! I hear people complaining about the pace, or about lack of fighting and plunder, but I assure you, it is not needed, for it has a lot of intrigues, unanswered questions, all sort of factors that will make you gasp on an episode per episode. The acting is exceptional, especially by Toby Stephens, who is unbelievable as Cpt. Flint, with such charisma that makes you root for him even dough he certainly doesn't deserve it. Female characters were a weak spot at the beginning, but that reeeeally changed quickly. I stumbled on this show while I was waiting for the new GoT season to start, and boy, was I surprised, I had more fun watching this than watered down episodes of GoT, that seem to go on forever, in one infinite circle. That was my favorite show, but after Breaking bad, True detective, and now this, the flaws are more than evident. ""Black sails"" are an absolute gem, I'm sorry for the all hate it's getting from the critics/GoT/Spartacus fans...",2014
10,"Fantastic series....if you can't watch for free its worth buying and I normally would never say that but I loved this form start to finish and every minute in between. It is pleasing on the eye regarding location as well as some of the cast but before forming an image in your mind of beautiful well over groomed characters that just don't look right then I am pleased to say that for once this is not the case....(OK slightly groomed here and there is more accurate) Acting is spot on,characters are mostly very likable, the action scenes are great, the story is for the most part simple with a main objective and doesn't have 50 twists along the way to try and out twist every thing else that gets made these days. I must point out that there are quite a lot of adult scenes and foul language which although I have no problem with it ,I definitely would not want any of my kids to be sat in the same room regardless of age, so don't let your kids watch it, no matter how much they love pirates. So if you fancy something a bit different with great actors and some proper filth, you must watch Black Sails.",2014
10,"As some other reviews point out here, this show is totally underrated. The production value is really quite high, especially for a pirate show like this where there's ships being blown apart, intricate costumes, detailed settings. I'm really pleased with the quality overall.",2015
10,"Rarely do I find a TV series worth my time to follow..Black Sails has got my attention. Actors are terrific and the storyline is adult and intriguing. The storyline mix of the Treasure Island prequel and true life historical pirates is extremely compelling. It is a TV genre that has never been explored before. I like seeing women in powerful roles (Eleanor) as I think it provides a positive role model. I just watched episode V and I am anxious see what happens next. Zach McGowen, Captain Vane, is doing an outstanding job in his pirate roleand his fit athletic frame is not hard to look at ...amazing shoulders and abs. Toby Stephens is really top notch as Captain Flint..he brings a passion to the role not unlike how I remember him as a Bond villain. The sets for the show are grandthe detail of the sailing ships is amazing..the scenery is dazzling. The unfurling of the top sails gave me a rush..photography was so good. I am glad to hear that there will be a second season. This is the first time that I have done a review in IMDb..I felt compelled after reading all the negatives from the other reviewers. I thought that the show overall is fast paced so I do not agree with some of the other reviewers (at all).",2014
9,To tell the truth there were many times in the first season that I almost stopped watching this show. But I stuck with it and boy was it ever rewarding. Season 1 was pretty slow to me sometimes boarder line uneventful. I know a few people that stopped watching after season one because of this. But Season 2 has been explosive. Probably one of the best seasons of a TV show out there and it was all due to the character development from the first season.,2015
10,Wow this show is amazing! The opening scene is absolutely brilliant one of the best opening's I have ever seen in a show before. The whole pilot is done extremely well plenty of Action which they really did well here. Character development is done really really good without going overboard which I was surprised. The setting and locations were absolutely amazing! It is exactly what I would have pictured back in the days of the Pirates. Story might be a bit confusing for some though you will understand it in the end. Honestly I really can't praise this show enough it's one of the best Pilots I have ever seen but then again I don't watch much TV. I really look forward to seeing this series to go on. I will be watching this every Saturday night. I recommend this to everyone that's looking for a good show. Absolutely brilliant 10/10,2014
9,"Really loving this show, I was pretty much hooked from the first opening sequence (superb cgi from ImaginaryForces & music by Bear McCreary)! Been waiting for a serious pirate drama that isn't based on comedy; because there really wasn't much to laugh about naval battles in the 1700's!",2014
10,"I've been hooked on this show since it's release, at last a proper Pirate T.V. series. In my opinion the attention to detail rivals such shows as Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, the acting has the potential to possibly match that of Breaking Bad. I would expect nothing less from the list of producers and directors. The Story line is much more complex then i first thought and the amount of time that the character building has taken so far just to understand and completely enjoy this show is immense but not unjustified. The performances by these actors and actresses (Toby Stephens, Hannah New, Zach McGowan, Luke Arnold, Louise Barnes, Tom Hopper and Mark Ryan) has increasingly made this show more intriguing and more powerful. I'm intrigued to watch and want more. There are no limits or boundaries as to what can and can't be done throughout this series. This series takes a bit of patience as it's only just starting out, but once you adjust and settle in for the ride it's exciting, truly exciting.",2014
10,"It's impossible to over-rate this series. Black Sails is pirates done right, at last, putting to shame all other video renditions (especially the over-the-top Disney fantasies).",2017
9,"At first glance, Black Sails is just another offering of sex and sadism in the tradition of Game of Thrones. Stick with it and you'll find the show moving past that. This is definitely a show that will suck you in.",2017
9,"I am liking this show more than I expected. I will admit things are slow going at the moment but then again, the show did just premiere a few weeks ago so the majority of the show, at the moment, is build up. I wouldn't go by what the negative reviews say about this show, it is good and it really builds up for something intense, hopefully. It's obviously no Game of Thrones, but it's still worthy of my attention every Saturday.",2014
10,"Finally we get a pirate show we can sink our teeth into. Pirates were pretty bad people, not like Captain Jack Sparrow or Pugwash. They terrorised and made the Caribbean a no-go area for many years. Black Sails has all the nasties in one place; Charles Vane, Flynt, Rackham and Ned Low. All horrifically violent individuals intent on causing whatever harm was necessary to get their prize (and enjoying it along the way!). Season one was mildly enjoyable but the show comes into its own in season two. The effects, sets, action, sex and brutality is all significantly increased. Lovers of Spartacus, Rome and Vikings will be in their element. OK so it's not Shakespeare and a bit of a guilty pleasure but so what? When a show is this entertaining all we care about is getting more! A fantastic, exciting, well- acted historical drama with a healthy dose of swashbuckling moments. A great triumph for the creators.",2015
9,"It's very bawdy - perhaps for some a little too much so. There are some scenes where this seems to be a little forced, but overall it maintains its equilibrium, but only just. It tries to place the viewer in unruly times, with unruly men and women, each who has an angle, a dream, a demon with which to contend.",2014
6,"First of all, for the good bits. It's a pirate themed TV show with the nicest production I've seen so far. It looks great, cast is decent, nothing to complain at in that regard. ",2017
10,"I cannot believe this show is ending. Only one more season. There are many other Pirates in history. Will miss. There are very few series that I watch religiously, this is one. The actors are wonderful and the plot enticing. So much is going on that apprehension peaks even with the reruns. Always something new, every time I watch them. We are taught that pirates were criminals, this show makes me think that they were indeed the first Patriots. First time I viewed them as just fighters for freedom and no oppression. The ultimate goal was not only riches of gold and assets, but peace of mind. This show gave me a different perspective of their needs and desires. Hopefully, additional seasons can be added.",2017
10,"Friends have been telling me to watch Black Sails for years, yet I put it off because I did not have Starz (and also because it didn't look that appealing overall). I recently earned myself a few free months of Starz and decided to give this is a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. ",2017
10,"How many TV shows have better season 2 than the first? Not many... I would say, But this one blows our minds with quality, acting and story telling.",2015
10,"I've felt love for this series from the first episodes. The cast, the story, the dark themes, the soundtrack.. I found them all exquisite. OK, I can see the reasons behind some of the bad reviews: it is not historically accurate.. Maybe it isn't.. the people weren't that healthy, nor that clean, nor that smart. Their vocabulary wasn't so diverse nor their speech so eloquent. However, this series mostly deals in legends than actual historic accuracy, from what I could gather. So one can imagine that even in the most desolate of settings, you have your smart individuals and you have your ""not-so-smart"" individuals, and of course the ones in-between. Following the natural order of things, the smart guys (few in number), with a little help from the inbetweeners, lead the others into doing great feats and risking their lives for causes they, themselves, do not fully understand. In my opinion, this is the central theme of the show. Of course, the drama, the action, the story and the cinematics.. they are all beautiful. But what I found most extraordinary was the actual dialogue between the characters.. Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone who likes a deep story and meaningful quotes.",2017
10,"I usually don't like any show with the genre drama as they tend to be always poorly written, very slow, usually includes some stupid teens, very dull, stupid, repetitive, drag on for ages and without any form of suspense.",2017
10,"I was fortunate to attend ComicCon for the STARZ preview of their new pirate adventure BLACK SAILS and also recently watched the early release of episode 1 online. From the on-set it's important to state that popular series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad first premiered on television to a very small audience and eventually became global hits as word got around. They started off as highly complicated, seriously involved and slow sleeper narrative drama's, but soon audiences were drawn into their worlds with their complex, layered and multi-faceted characters. I truly believe that the above certainly applies to this new gritty TV series. Sure, there's the expected sex, violence, nudity and profanity, but not for one moment is this gratuitous and uncalled for in the specific style and genre of this period piece. The amazing sets, costumes and general attention to intricate detail is astounding and I believe, quite unique and unexpected for original cable television production. Some critics initially expected this Michael Bay production to be meaningless, non-stop action sequences with very little depth, storyline and character development. While other reviewers offered that there was perhaps not enough action and too much conversation and multi- layered story-lines. I honestly see this series offering audiences everything that they'd expect, want and desire in an action drama. There is clearly more than meets the eye in the Pilot episode and I imagine that fans will eventually be drawn into this colorful world as the story develops over the coming weeks and months. It excites me that the series has already been renewed for a second season, as clearly the writers have a lot to tell.",2014
10,The character development in this series is that of the highest quality a show could offer and I am of opinion that that is arguably the most important quality a show has to possess to keep it interesting.,2017
9,"I tuned into this expecting the worst, so I've been surprised at how the series grabbed me at the beginning and has kept my attention. Granted, I don't have it marked as ""must-see TV"" on my calendar, the way I did with new episodes of ""The Sopranos,"" but I've seen the first 6 episodes and am looking forward to the final 2 of the season.",2014
10,Today I watch the last episode of Black Sails.....I am a 71 year old man and I cried openly twice.....the endings were so wonderful. My life is somewhat different after it. This series has got to be the most amazing TV I have ever witnessed - how on earth did they construct those incredible high seas battles with the old ships?? Most episodes I watched twice in case I missed something.....the whole idea of mixing fictional characters from Treasure Island and real ones was inspirational.....I went back and read Treasure Island again just to be sure. The lead character played by Toby Stevens was superlative but the relatively unknown actors (for me anyway) are going to hit the big time as a result of this series especially the likes of Luke Arnold and Toby Schmitz both of which were unbelievably good with such lucid prose (did they really speak so well in those days?...is there a modern day conflict with Robert Newton's famous drawl??) Can't wait for the Emmys or whatever....if they don't truly recognize this masterpiece then I for one will despair. Happy but choked that it's all over......I can only do it justice by rewarding it with a 10.,2017
4,"The plot was predictable. The characters aren't original. I guess the younger crowd and die hard fans will probably like it but as an avid movie fan Guardians kind of disappointed me. Acting was kind of terrible too. Bautista played Drax as if Drax was TRYING to sound intelligent. He couldn't pull off the smart brute. Zoe tried too hard to be bad a$$ and it wasn't natural. The Collector... Don't get me started... What reason was there for The Collector to even open and show anybody the Infinity Stone? It's a super powerful object that he knew was very powerful, why show Thanos' daughter or the outlaw? The bad guys were the worst, so campy. Ronin reminded me of a pro wrestler during an interview. Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed. Booooring.... The movie wasn't terrible but after reading the super reviews on IMDb, I had to say something.",2014
10,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. ",2014
9,"I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion.

I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.",2014

1,"I've never seen so bad movie since ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".... HOW?HOW can this movie has a rating above 8?? From the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess! Childish plot, childish characters and awful, AWFUL humor ALL the times !! Even in the ""serious"" and ""important"" scenes there's always a stupid joke to ruin the moment(which is already ruined but anyway..). countless clichés and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells! The CGI where just OK and the fight scenes were at best indifferent..there were also some slo-mo scenes with nothing really to offer,i mean it's like a guy jumping in slow motion...seriously!nothing cool about it nothing new!Nothing about this movie is new or original! I have nothing else to say for this ""movie""..stay away!",2014

It should be good right? Doesn't matter that Marvel made only crap movies, most of them anyway, with a few exceptions, some of the first Spiderman movies and some X-men movies, maybe they nailed it this time.",2014

9,"You might expect a movie studio at the top of its game to play it safe rather than strike out in new, bizarre directions. Certainly, it's hard to imagine any other studio giving the greenlight to Guardians Of The Galaxy - a huge blockbuster movie based on a title unfamiliar to anyone who isn't a comics aficionado, starring a relatively unknown actor playing a character most people have never heard of. And yet, Marvel scores once again with its willingness to head off the beaten track. GUARDIANS is a fun, fizzy delight, even as it mines some surprising depths of emotion from its ragtag group of anti-heroes.",2014

8,"It's no surprise that when Marvel's latest movie was released many, many people (the non comics reading kind, mainly) said ""Who?""

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a shot I chose to try in god knows how long since I've been to the cinema. This is just another load of Hollywood trash.

1,"I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn't mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichés extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it's Marvel, what could go wrong? It's sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichés...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of ""saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just Earth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different"" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a cliché-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure.",2014
1,"If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then, after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley Kubrick.",2014
1,"So - my son and I went to watch GotG. After reading mixed reviews we were skeptical but curious. The bad reviews unfortunately were right. The movie has no story line, stupid characters (like a talking raccoon) and more bad language than most rated R films I have seen. The producers were trying to cover the lack of plot with senseless action scenes that all seemed random and disconnected. Do yourself a favor and save the money you spend - you will get more pleasure from a big cup of ice cream. I can't believe Glenn Close and Vin Diesel took even small roles in this.",2014
1,"Such an awful wreck! There I said it. These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a ""fantastic"" and ""great"" and ""awesome"" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The ""Ten out of Ten"" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand what you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say...""okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?"" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's humanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista as Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall performance (if any) Why? Well, you'll be sharing this characters maniacal laughter once you've realized you wasted valuable devotion for a franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions rather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his quirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect trio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the threatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT COULD GO WRONG...oh I don't know... Let's start predicting before we start watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It's PG-13, so no, but is there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a film! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZERO",2014
10,"I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.",2014
10,"I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!",2014
8,"Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like ""this movie just does everything right"" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste). ",2014
3,"I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.",2015
1,"This movie started out slow but had a typical, predictable story-line until......Colin Firth's character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people single-handedly. The violence was beyond gruesome (poles being shoved up underneath people's chins into their heads, stabbings, shootings, anything you can think of). I haven't wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but I stuck it out because I was with someone else and figured it couldn't get any worse. WRONG! Next thing you know, there are microchips overheating and making HUNDREDS of people's heads explode, all to music. It was horrendous. But wait! There's more! Let's not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him MOUNT HER! Sexist much? Are you effing kidding me? I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",2015
9,"#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. ",2015
1,"I can't understand how so many people loved this movie. I was really looking forward to a funny, over the top action film, but Kingsman left a lot to be desired. For starters the women in this movie are all portrayed as being completely helpless. (Eggsy's useless mother, his friend in the Kingsman who can't seem to get anything done without reassurance from Eggsy and obviously the very dignified princess who happily offers Eggsy anal in exchange for him saving the world...fml). I was actually freaked out by the number of teenagers who thought the multiple scenes of mass murder of innocent people for absolutely no reason were hilarious. Of course the fact that those people's heads exploded into colorful fireworks probably helped. Lastly, what's a comedy without a little vomit humor and mocking individuals with speech impediments. I lost a lot of respect for Colin Firth for this one.",2015
10,"Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!",2015
9,"People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. ",2015
1,"It started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence. I'll give it that. Then it started getting extremely graphic. Mass murders, heads exploding, our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldn't even talk all the way home. We all wish we could unsee it. I felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts. This movie taught me a lesson, I will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review I can get my hands on, this isn't the first time I have been blind sighted by gore, and disturbing content. If you see this movie, I beg you not to take your kids, even if they are adults. I wish I could go back and NOT have gone to this one. Frankly, I am disappointed that movie makers feel Americans have sunk so low as to find this entertaining.",2015
1,"In the first 5 minutes of this abhorrently violent film, one of the film's protagonists is literally sliced in half, length-wise, from top to bottom, by a (yawn) hot, Asian-looking, double-amputee with some sort of ""slasher foot-prosthetics"" on her tawny, spandex-clad limbs. Yes, you read that right. Not only are the physics involved in this ludicrous action simply impossible, there is NO blood--nothing. Just an insipidly-dumb, ill-conceived effect designed to make sadistic killing ""funny"" and elicit a cheap ""ooh!"" from the audience. ",2015
10,"It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense? ",2015
3,"An interesting storyline that went from elegant to trashy to sickening to tasteful to distasteful. What kind of people think that exploding heads is a comedy act? Or for that matter, a mother trying to kill her little girl!? Finally, ends with the ""requisite"" piece of ass that serves absolutely no purpose in the story line and is done in such a trashy way. Very crass and off-putting. Vaughn and Goldman seem to have social issues with sick humor. ",2015

2,"It's outrageously stupid. I have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the Kingsman, and none of them hit the right mark. The movie is violent, raunchy, campy, sexist, racist, and vulgar. And that's all OK! But does it have to be so incredibly stupid? Honestly, does it? And why is the CGI so incredibly terrible. Last time I checked this is 2015, not 1985. I usually don't care too much for special effects, but there is a given level of competence which I expect a film to achieve, before it just becomes distracting. Kingsman has CGI on the level of a cheep SyFy channel special feature.",2015
1,"I hated this movie. It's not just a truly horrible film. It's so incredibly ultra violent. It's like the video game Grand Theft Auto with zombies. Only worse! This was the most disgusting type of violence, gratuitous and glorified. Truly over the top. The trailer for this movie is 100 % misleading. It makes it look like a James Bond movie. In reality it's more like a zombie movie. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I wish I could un-buy this movie ticket. I wish I could un-see this movie. It's truly the worst movie I've ever seen. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! I gave this movie 1 Star but if I could I would give it a minus 10. I feel sick to my stomach. Most definitely!",2015
1,"Hard to sit through, and terribly misleading. It's a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters, commemorating death, advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress, and portraying mass murder as a 'cool action scene'. The first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film. Easy to compare to the Bond films, however, as the movie progressed, the entire validity of the characters' morals were flushed down the drain. I and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film. The trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement, then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement. I stress, please watch at your own discretion.",2015
10,"I had the privilege of seeing this at an advanced screening and I was already looking forward to seeing this film and it exceeded all my expectations. Knowing that this film was directed by Matthew Vaughn(Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) I had a pretty good idea that this film was going to be really good. If you love fast-paced, stylish, humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service. I can guarantee a film like this won't win any major awards but I can guarantee that you will have an entertaining time with this film. Must see 10/10",2015
1,"Bad humor, ridiculous special effects, a very cheap plot and awful acting. That sums up this waste of time and money. What is worse is that IMDb's rating system has been abused to market this rubbish. The difference between the IMDb rating and Metascore should tell you enough.",2015
1,"Sorry, will receive lots of grief for this no doubt. As a huge Bond fan, I loved the concept of the movie. Colin Firth fantastic in this role, Michael Caine great as usual, loved Mark Strong's character but was really turned off by so much of this movie.",2015
1,"Kingsman the secret service was a pretty standard action/spy movie that had way to much violence and gore. The plot was predictable and absurd to say the least and seemed to be mostly parodying other spy films, but with an excess of pointless violence, particularly the church scene, which emphasized how the violence was used to try and make up for the terrible plot. The use of excessive violence starts with the opening 10 minutes showing a man being sliced in half and not to mention the umpteen head shots shown in slow motion throughout the film. It all became really tiresome and made me want to stop watching to be honest. All in all a movie that will be remembered for pointless violence and nothing more. Hence, the reason it gets a 1 from me.",2015
2,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is like two films, really. It starts out the neoclassic, early-Bondesque, spy-thriller-meets-Hunger-Games mash-up the trailers make it out to be. The plot and characters are compelling enough that you want to hang in, suspend disbelief and see where this is going. But it hits a wall in the last 30 minutes or so; from the conclusion of the church scene on, it's Austin-Powers-meets-Jackass-meets-Spring-Breakers-Gone-Wild. Screenplay, direction, production values all tank; it's like Vaughn got pulled off to another project and left the sum-up to his high-school interns ... or the guys at his car wash. And the camp factor comes too late and too abruptly to pull this into ""cult"" territory. The Vaughn fanboys will disagree, of course, and there are plenty on these boards. This movie suits the adolescent boy-fantasy mindset; if your standards are at all higher, you'll be disappointed. Pity, really. If I'd walked out after the first hour, this could've been a good 7-8 film.",2015

10,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.",2014
10,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.",2014

10,"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",2014
7,"Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.",2014

6,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.",2014
4,"I am a Nolan fan but, and perhaps that's why, I see Interstellar as a failed magic act. The multi-layered surprise and amazement that we have come to expect of Nolan's films did not deliver. I believe this particular film, like Prometheus, failed due to the maker's inherent desire to create an epic - it took on too much, tried too hard and did it all wrong. ",2014
1,"It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.",2014

Now whilst I understand that sci-fiction doesn't follow the rules of reality (suspension of disbelief and all), there still has to be coherency, rules, and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie. This movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewer's intelligence.",2014
10,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you.

However had I scrolled further down to see where they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for.

Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.",2014
1,"this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books!

1,"My honest rating would be 6 for that movie but I rated it 1 to balance the ""emotional"" ratings. Cast and the part with Matt Damon were good.

If you have a thinking mind which does not surrender to the dirty drama games of the commercial script writers then your brain cells will hurt like a b... after seeing that much nonsense. Unfortunately, that is the destiny of almost all movies playing with the time concept except the Back to the Future trilogy. What concerns me more than the quality of the movie itself is the number of blown-up ratings threatening the credibility of IMDb, which I always trust. Who are you people?

They don't deserve your money because they did not put enough effort to create a meaningful story and I would accept any meaning in its own logic.",2014
1,"It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy',  'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the  movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've  experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the  current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad.  The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this  blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and  stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his  daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what  in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of  events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was  apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no  easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if  they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means  they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose  McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this  purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's  office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational  alternatives?  On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT  TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions?  While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble  attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he  would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime  for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into  how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on  the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was  hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying  to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could  do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require  his daughter 25 years to figure out.  And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named  after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and  they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same  thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without  needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity  saved in the same way.  Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them  properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece...",2014
