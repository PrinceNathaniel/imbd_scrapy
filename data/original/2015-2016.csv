9,"Please I've read the moans petitions about how this glorifies Satan.. Sorry but so does Supernatural. Why do people in the US take this stuff so seriously. It a send up OK? Lucifer is witty and charming with fabulous one liners. The plot is terrible. (So are many of Supernaturals... Sorry guys) but we don't watch it for that.. if we believed every series on TV. I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat ""Cos Aliens are here"" ",2015
8,"Losing the red horn and pitchfork for debonair skin, the titular entity roams our world with wealth and taste. Lucifer is a quirky, somewhat mischievous take on the fallen angel. It has many pop references, cool soundtracks and more importantly, a smooth convincing acting from the lead actor Tom Ellis.",2015
10,"Well. This is my first review, for many time here and never done one, is because, this is the first time I got something worth to review. Even if English is not my mother language, I will try my best... sorry if something is misspelled or wrong written. I like complex things. And this character (religion out) is far more complex than any. I read the comics ""The Sandman"" and ""Lucifer"", and the premise is cool, considering the series is attached some how with the new issues coming from the comic. I liked the acting, specially Ellis... the girl is fine, and I like the chemistry between them. And more of it,the FX, for a TV series are cool. The script was fine, and got me (but... I knew who did it, to much TV for me, I confess. Though I will not spoil it) In the other hand, I know some people say it was overrated, but: There is a flavor for every taste... And for my taste it was awesome, delicious and brilliant. Every one is a critic, and every one can criticize, but it worth to take a look, just to know if you like it or not. And for the ones on seeing the religious way... People, there are others channels and other series to watch. That is it. Greetings from Uruguay.",2015
9,"So I suppose I'll begin by explaining this: I've actually never written a review or rated anything on IMDb, though have been using the site for as long as I can remember. Then I came by Lucifer. As he does in the pilot, I felt compelled to create an account just to write this and give this show the rating I feel it deserves!",2015
8,"As a fan of the supernatural, I was intrigued when I heard about Lucifer. However, seeing as I've been burned before, I started watching it with relatively low expectations. I was positively surprised by the shows' wittiness and clever dialogue. The devil is portrayed as a charming fellow who knows his way around the ladies; at least till he meets officer Chloe Dancer. His cheekiness and sarcasm makes him a breath of fresh air compared to the characters often found in supernatural shows, where the devils and demons are constantly acting as if they have a stick up their behind. Lucifer is not trying to be dark and mysterious, but fast-paced and humorous. At least that is my perception after watching the pilot. I will follow this show and hope it will continue this promising trend.",2015
9,"The kids and I watched this last night, nothing scary, pretty much PG and compared to all the other pilots out at the moment this was very good and has the most potential. We liked Tom Ellis as Lucifer, there was humour and subtle special effects as well as in your face special effects.",2015
1,"If this show were entirely new and not based in a comic series, it would still be incredibly lame.",2015
1,"how many more series should have less than 7 rating till producers stop making stupid cop shows? another special guy helping police solving cases! we already have I zombie,limitless,blacklist..... there are 3 more i forgot their names! so tired of the same stupid ,boring pointless plot! I'm just wondering how a producer accepts these kinds of scenarios ? i mean they already know the response to these type and yet they do it! i wasted my time watching 3 episodes. putting aside him helping the cop ,there is the part that the angel stops the time and comes in like 2 times per episode and asks Lucifer to go back and every time Lucifer gives him the same answer ! is the angel dumb? or maybe the father don't get it and re sends the stupid angel all the time! the other lame part is the CGI of the devils face!it's so fake and ridiculous that even a 5 year old wont get scared ! and why in hell Lucifer the lord of hell should be so sensitive and kind?he just changes over night to this cool kind guy who cares for others?he doesn't even get angry and he can control his anger! the actor is good but not for this role ! this show is doomed and i hope it get axed along with the other stupid cop shows ! i hope all their producers lose their jobs so they learn how to make series",2016
1,"I would have liked to have said that this is ""just another odd-couple police procedural"", of which there has been a large number of in recent years. Unfortunately, it falls short of even this low bar.",2016
10,"Wow, What a pilot episode!",2015
1,I imagine the meeting between the creator and the studio going a little like this.,2016
1,"THEY have a plan that sounds more or less like this: let's take something with market value, buy the rights, send the whole package at our underground monkey writing lab, spin the story until devoid of any meaningful plot it becomes just another tasteless format. There you go! Now let's tease the fan base with some useless reference to what they love while carefully not scaring our formatted public with anything new or original. At this point the first obvious question would be: why bother? Production companies have hundreds of complete and developed stupid format ideas when it comes to cop shows or hospital shows, you want the single-mum detective? Got it! The drunken rough but wise cop on his road to salvation? Got it! You want the teenager cop who solves crimes in partnership with a ghost? Got it! So? Why ruin good source material to produce an awfully anonymous copy of the very same format? As it happens I have my very own conspiracy theory: they're out to buy and destroy any kind of original piece of writing which now or in the future might pose a threat to the ""same-s#itty-idea"" global domain, they have agents everywhere, they even start up innocent-looking production companies apparently untied to their secret organisation to acquire TV rights of everything and kill ideas in their cradle. Sounds good? I'm selling...",2015
9,"Another police procedural TV show you ask? Yes, but nothing like this out there. his should not work as well as it does. I want to hate it but I can't. You can't rate this on one episode... you have to watch at least 3 to see why it's so addictive and amazing. Well done!",2018
1,This show is so boring and cliché you can replace Lucifer with anything and the show would still work out.,2016
1,I'm so tired of LA taking a really good comic book and turning in to a lousy film or TV-series without even understanding the point and the depth of the original story.,2016
1,"Really awful. Yes it took me the entirety of the pilot to get past the point that the only thing this show shares with one of my favorite comic books was the name, but then I watched the next one with an open mind... ""Let's give it a chance,"" I thought,""Maybe it's good for it's own reasons. Maybe they've done something interesting by changing all the characters and the premise and the general tone and atmosphere""",2016
1,"How tragically sad it is that some TV viewers consider this to be in any way creative, artistic or inspiring. What low standards!!! After happening to some across this, and viewing 15 minutes of such typical Trash A Vision, I felt sick and changed the channel. This is boring, typical TV and vile. I am still recovering. Do producers actually think that shocking us with blow jobs and new ways of displaying violence against women is what viewers want? What a waste of time on the part of anybody involved with this. Don't waste your time or any bit of your good heart or valuable time with this low quality junk. 'So done with the overwhelming vast majority of TV folks.",2016
1,"What's the point of this show other than to fill a time-slot vacated by other failed shows? The devil, the potent symbol of temptation and evil, is rehabilitated into an avenging cop wanna-be. Really? He's depicted as a Hollywoodesque alluring male fantasy-figure: well-groomed, athletic, with an upper-class British accent and possessing cool cars, clothes, and big boy materialistic toys. He's anti-children (i.e., anti-responsibility). Hmmm, a page taken out of the old, tired Play Boy magazine formula. Yawn. It lacks wit. Los Angeles as a surrogate Paradise Lost? Would have been amusing to see how the Devil would respond to a LA rush hour traffic jam or proselytizing Christian street-missionaries instead of stereotypical 'beautiful people' in night club shticks. We can only hope that Lucifer gets sent back to hell where he belongs in short order.",2016
2,"I can not believe the premise of this show, who pitched this? have they completely ran out of ideas for cop shows, Police Officers have been teamed up with ghost, dogs, puppets, and even their mothers, now wait for it, now we have Lucifer the king of Hell. I have seen this done better in a movie called Horns, if this was a comedy I would completely understand but its not funny, its not fantasy, because who would fantasies about this lame pair up. Stop or the devil will shoot, the devil leaves hell because he no longer wants to play the part God has given him, OK, then he decides to play gum shoe to revenge the death of some random human that I guess we should just guest she means something to him, his partner even tells him stop caring your the Devil, AWWWWW! Terrible show.",2016
1,"I don't know why, but i REALLY hate this show. I just do. If you like it, good for you. It doesn't make you a bad person. But i really despise this show.",2016
1,"This pilot is not at all close to the comic character created by Neil Gaiman in Sandman and continued by Mike Carey in the Lucifer series. In Gaiman and Carey's works, Lucifer Morningstar is a scheming, apathetic creature, bent on defying God and escaping his creation. Here he is cheerful and playful, following the detective around on this case and humoring those around him.",2015
2,"For those who don't know, the premise for this show was taken from a graphic novel, which in itself was a spin off from The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman. ",2016
1,"Extremely disappointing, what a bad acting from all actors and actresses no exception. I was so thrilled at first but within 15 minutes of the pilot I realized how shallow and poorly written and performed it was, and it went on and on in the following episodes. Bring Back RUSH! Tom Ellis was much better in than this painful series of 30 minutes long episodes. It is a show with a great initial concept, but was very poorly executed, like what were they thinking, they just ruined what could have been a new thrilling and brilliant show. It surely does not deserve the rating other users are giving it, please let the production do something about it. Rush should have stayed on and Lucifer should get canceled.",2016
1,"This program is guaranteed to provoke a ""religious experience"" in any viewer. As you watch it, you will think to yourself ""oh GOD ....could it get any worse""? ",2016
8,"I thought the show was a hoot - Lucifer shows his imperfection even with his suave, sophisticated accent, he manages to mispronounce Mischievous as 'Mischievious'. It's funny how he actually calls himself Lucifer - I wonder if the name will catch on in the baby naming books - hopefully not. I must admit, when I first saw the title, I was not too sure I liked the idea but in reality - it's a bit of fun, not to be taken too seriously. There's a definite chemistry between Lucifer and his female cop associate but she knows how to handle him well. I think it's an OK show, so far. I guess the next episodes of the series will show if it's a keeper.",2015
10,"As a native Colombian, born and raised in Medellin (in 1975) and victim myself of the Pablo Escobar era, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with the show!!! I thought it was going to be another bad gringo movie about Colombia with lots of mistakes and not even Colombian landscapes in the background but, I WAS WRONG!!!! Very good actors too, I didn't like Escobar accent since it's not real Paisa accent but it's OK; it will go unnoticed to non- native Colombians ;)",2015
10,"Incidentally, I saw an ad for Narco on YouTube, and instead of skipping the ads like I normally do, I played this one out because I was genuinely excited for what I was watching. Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart. ",2015
8,This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen two episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. ,2015
10,"It's beautiful , this's the way TV-series should be directed and produced, i loved the fast pace of the series from the first minute till now i haven't skipped anything or felt bored.",2015
9,Since movies have become nothing but shoot-em-ups and comic books television has emerged as the way to get great drama to adults.,2015
9,"Alright so, when it comes to drug related TV Shows which almost always include the DEA, the first thing that comes to mind is Breaking Bad and The Wire.",2015
10,"Having seen all Padilha movies, I was anxious to see this new Netflix series and had great expectations. He did it again. I cannot stop watching. One episode after another. OK if the cast is not Colombian. But they are all good actors and play the parts very well. I will try to finish this weekend all the episodes but i think there will be more seasons. Best series of the year so far. The action is great. The scenarios are perfect. The 1980's atmosphere is awesome. 10 out 0f 10. I hope they will make more series like that in the future. Good real stories and perfect action and direction. I could not expect less from Padilha.",2015
10,"Narcos is an American crime thriller television series. Narcos is an intriguing and entertaining series. Netflix again done a very good job. Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story. ",2016
10,"Many Colombians will object to this series, because it draws so much attention to an aspect of their culture of which most of them are not proud. The reality is, society-connected Colombians of a certain age all know someone personally that profited from the drug trade. Most folks I knew there brushed elbows with someone famous from Cali, at some point. It was a talking point back then, but maybe not now. ",2017
9,"TO all Colombians complaining of Moura's accent: get a life. Did you really expect all of the guys to be playing their characters with perfect accents? I'll give you a tip: this show wasn't made for Colombian audience, but for worldwide audience. And they sound great to me :-) The portrait of Medellin seems quite good, and the only reason I'm not giving 10 stars is Murphy's annoying voice narrating even the simplest events, like if we couldn't see it. Pascal, Padilha and Moura did a great job, but all the actors playing small characters were also good. If you like History, DOcumentaries, series and besides all, a little bit violence, then, you're gonna love Narcos.",2015
9,There are very few series that deserve to be considered great. This could well be up there.,2015
10,"At one point in Episode 7 the new president of Colombia says to a group of US officials trying to have him accept more aid to hunt Escobar, ""660 tons of cocaine were consumed in the United States last year. Perhaps if your resources were focused at home we'd all be better off.""",2015
10,I just watched the first three episodes of this new Netflix series and it is just awesome. The vintage 80's charm plus the good acting and the amazing story line will keep your attention like a fast paced action or thriller movie. ,2015
10,"After the charismatic performance by Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar and the story of Pablo Escobar itself, we thought Narcos will find tough time finding the same quality of story. ",2017
10,"When Padilha bring to us Robocop reboot I was really sad to see one of the greatest mind in show business just vanish. I recently see a interview when he move out to Los Angeles, because Brazil become dangerous to he an his family, consequence of his movies about dirt Brazilian cops, and he have been attack on his studio back in Rio De Janeiro, and now I see he was right, he did again, the great Jose Padilhais back. I love Wagner Moura, and all the scenes of Pablo Escobar is just amazing. Resuming, this series is solid, just another Breaking Badlike, but with new stuff and Padilha's scenes, AMAZING! Jus watch this amazing show, too realistic and fun...",2015
9,"This series is captivating, dark, intense, addictive and I can't wait for season 4! Breaking Bad is the best series ever but Narcos is more real and almost as good. It's just getting better and better.",2017
10,"The first season and the second season have focused on the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar and Medillin Cartel. It was a bit difficult to get used to Narcos without Pablo Escobar, but especially after episode 5, the series went crazy. Apart from Escobar, Steve Murphy does not exist, I do not know why, but Javier Pena is closing this gap very well. The most hated character of season 3 was undoubtedly David Rodriguez. I can say it's hard for me to avoid head-on-the-scenes. My favorite characters are of course Javier Pena and Jorge Salcedo. Thanks to these two guys on season three, it's been so good. There was Chepe Santacruz who looks like Pablo. He is also one of my favorite characters. This season did not feature in detail the events and characters from other seasons. In the first two seasons, everything was processed to the finest detail and the details were given for a long time. But on the third season, the opposite is happening.They also finished the Cali cartel, which they said was great from Escobar. I guess we could say that's the only bad thing.",2017
2,"Before watching this TV show I had already watched the 113 episodes of the original series 'Pablo Escobar, El patron del mal' that was broadcasted on Colombian TV stations a few years ago. I loved the way they told the story and I was impressed by many of the the actors. Specially Andres Parra who plays Pablo. Luckily enough I speak Spanish fluently and had no need for subtitles. Having this to compare with I noticed that the US version of the story, 'Narcos', had changed a lot of important things, had crammed things together and also invented a few new things I had problems believing. For starters the focus of the 'Narcos' is to show how thanks to USA and the work of an American in Colombia they where able to catch Escobar. But they left out the story of people that where really affected by him and the people that really did all the hard work. The Colombian newspapers, journalists, politicians, police and military. Shameful and also boring! The camera-work and cutting etc, and a few of the actors where perfectly OK, just a shame the story is so... wrong!",2015
6,"awful manipulation of allegedly truthful events in order to make the American organizations, as usual, the heroes of the story.",2015
6,"In general, Narcos the series is an underachiever.",2015
10,"This is the only show I can truly enjoy while scoffing down an 8 pack of Monster Munch, the subtitles means no important plot lines are missed. Apparently 5 lines of text are needed so I thought I'd list some other foods you can eat.",2017
7,"Initially I thought it was very mediocre, although it did improve significantly as the story progressed. I have quite a lot of issues with it, however. The characterisation is limited, and to me that is a huge problem because I consider characterisation to be the key component of any story. Generally I prefer shows that are deeper, more engaging and with a heavier tone. That's not to say I automatically dislike the lighter approach in this genre – Justified did that and was one of my favourite shows. This though didn't have the charm, likability or witty dialogue that Justified had. Ultimately this show ended up feeling too superficial due to the lack of depth. I would also say it lags considerably behind some of the other top foreign language shows I have watched recently such as Romanzo Criminale, Gomorrah and Les Revenants. ",2016
6,"I've read a few books on Pablo Escobar, Columbian drug trafficker. Narco's is a US take on the Escobar drug empire, which falls short of the mark. ",2015
10,"Very Addicting show, Love the action and suspense I can look forward to when sitting back on Netflix and putting Narcos on. Just finished season 3 in a breeze and was kept very interested in the Cali Cartel and how they were taken down. Season 1 & 2 about Pablo definitely blew season 3 out of the water, but I'm crossing my fingers Narcos comes back for a season 4 in Mexico despite what happened with their casting director. One of my top 5 favorite shows in a list including Breaking Bad, Black Mirror, Weeds, and Entourage.",2017
6,"If you were expecting something as good as Daredevil, don't. Is it close? Maybe for some but my experience was rather disappointing given my high expectations based on the previous series that blew me away.",2015
10,"I am truly baffled by the negative reviews. This show is incredible. Every character is truly fascinating and we get glimpses of their back stories to supplement the story, but I guess people are disappointed that not everything was revealed immediately? I am almost positive that the mystery of Jessica Jones' background is intentional and they will reveal more as the show develops. As for people that complain that the show is boring....these must be the people keeping things like the Transformers series in business. If you're looking for constant explosions and action, you'll be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a show with well developed characters, a chilling villain, a compelling and relatable main character, an intriguing storyline, and just utterly spectacular acting, this is the show for you. No, it's not a typical superhero show. It goes above and beyond in so many aspects. This has raised the bar for superhero stories, in my opinion. Krysten Ritter is superb and very believable as Jessica Jones. I love love love this show! Give it a chance, you will not be sorry you did! I can't wait for Season 2.",2016
5,"Good not great. It's hard to measure up the ridiculously high bar set by Marvel's Daredevil and this show does bring something new and different to the table in the superhero genre. There were also strong performances from Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter, David Tennant, and Rachael Taylor.",2015
1,"I really wanted to give this show a shot, but the main character is just not very believable and I don't know who this show is supposed to appeal to. It's like they are trying to glorify dangerous sexual behavior and rape culture but brand it as feminism. She's supposed to be a detective, but you hardly see any impressive detective work, but rather, things just fall into her lap with little to no effort on her part. ",2015
3,"If you like slow, boring, averagely written wanna be super-hero shows you hit the jackpot with this one. Even the sex scenes are boring, which may seem hard to do, but this show found a way. The lead character gives you nothing to care about. When she hurts, so what, when she's sad, who cares, you get the idea. It's doubly sad because they have such great material to work with. Jessica's story is perfect for a Netflix show. It isn't too flushed out, so good writers can mold it any way they wish too, but these writers seem to be okay with sub-par plots and story lines. Her relationship with Luke Cage is a nice touch, but their chemistry is less plastic explosive and more baking soda volcano.",2015
5,"As I look at these reviews, I see a lot of people that have watched one or two episodes and anointed this show as innovative and the best of its kind. I was a HUGE fan of Daredevil and I could not wait for the other installments of the Defenders series. To this end, I watched every episode of this show before deciding to review it. I never review shows because I am not a fan boy nor am I self-important enough to think my opinion holds that much weight. I love Krysten Ritter from Don't Trust the B and I appreciate Carrie Anne-Moss's effort, the actor who played Luke Cage as well as David Tennant's work with what he was given. I will say however that this show was extremely disappointing and it does not deserve its initial praise. To praise it is to beg for more like it and I can do no such thing.",2015
9,"If you're considering watching this show, chances are you've already watched Marvel's Daredevil and know what to expect: a darker, grittier tone than the rest of the Marvel universe, great production values and strong characterization. It delivers all those things and more.",2015
10,"Much like Daredevil, the real saga of Jessica Jones is that of the Villain. David Tennant shines as a dark and broken sociopath. His performance is chilling and terrifying and asks dark questions about what we would do with ultimate power over those around us, and about what would become of us.",2015
10,"Jessica Jones is what happens when you strip off a superhero's spandex and explosions. Taking away the flash of Hollywood block-busters puts a great burden on both the plot and actors, and Jessica Jones excels in both.",2016
2,"I started watching Jessica Jones feeling hopeful. After all, I am a big fan of Netflix and their original series, I know they have great original content, so I was expecting Jessica Jones to be a hit too. But boy, was I wrong. I watched the 1st episode, then the second, third, fell asleep somewhere on the 4th, woke up and just skipped to the last one to see how this boring show will end. It was an uneventful and pretty lame ending too, in line with everything else.",2015
9,"If for nothing else, watch Jessica Jones for David Tennant's performance as Kilgrave. He is better than any other Marvel movie or TV villain ever seen before. He is truly terrifying but oddly hypnotizing. He can make you do whatever he tells you to. Not only does David Tennant's charisma make this believable, but the writers use it in a lot of cool ways. As a villain, he's right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.",2015
10,"Until Daredevil came out, I thought I was done with superheroes. I couldn't stand those horribly mediocre Hollywood films, which nowadays are based only on visuals and 3D, so that the ""It's completely different, if you go to the cinema"" types of people would be happy. Not to mention Arrow and other similar series, where everyone sooner or later becomes some kind of a superhero and a completely stereotypical character. To me, Daredevil was the turning point. It all started this whole deviation from these typical patterns, according to which it seems like every superhero film/ TV show is being made of, and Jessica Jones just brought to whole new level what Daredevil started. There is a saying that everything has been done before, and if you are watching TV shows on daily basis, you will probably have a hard time not believing it. But Jessica Jones proved me wrong and I can easily say that this adult Marvel Universe is one of the best things that could happen not only to superhero genre, but to TV shows in general.",2015
1,Jessica Jones is a snarly bleak moody story primarily about drama. Disgusing itself as heroine chic but clogged by cliché.,2015
2,"...but I'll round up to 20, since IMDb doesn't allow for half points. I say 15% because that is roughly the amount of screen time allotted to Kilgrave in this first season, who turned out to be the only remotely interesting character on the show. (Needless to say, that means if he doesn't return in the second season, there will be no reason to watch at all.) Don't get me wrong: the scenes where Kilgrave did appear were great: 10/10, primarily due to David Tennant's performance (great to see him playing a real villain). But it only put the mediocrity of the other actors into sharp relief, making most of the show unbearable. By about episode 9, I just started fast-forwarding to get to the bits with him in it. I wanted to like this show - and it could have been really good - but unfortunately it was plagued by lazy, dumb writing, poor characterization, tedious subplots, and pointless, cheezy sex scenes. Especially the time spent on the Luke Cage subplot was ill spent - in part because the actor playing him was about as charismatic as a block of wood. But the screen time devoted to the relationships between Trish and Simpson, on the one hand, and Hogarth and her secretary, on the other, was equally mystifying. It was like they couldn't think of enough material to fill 13 episodes, so started cramming in random filler. The show would have been much stronger if they had infused just a little realism and maturity into the scripts, and kept the focus on the Jessica/Kilgrave relationship, which was compelling and (largely)well written.",2015
2,----------Contains spoilers-----------,2015
9,"Just like Jessica Jones' super-human strength, Netflix has proved its own strength in producing yet another high-quality TV series. (Ughh, am I really going to include this sentence) Jessica Jones is the story about a private investigator, Jessica Jones, an alcoholic retired superhero, who battles with the devil of her past, a mind controller known as Kilgrave. Learning about her rough past and her current problems, we learn that Jessica Jones is a very broken character that proves to be a compelling protagonist. ",2015
7,"I watched the show due to David Tennant playing a leading role and was very happy with what I found. Good casting, interesting plot, good soundtrack and all round good entertainment. It did take a while for all the characters to come into play but by the time I reached the later episodes and an umpteenth escape for the villain I began to tire. This is not necessarily the fault of the creators but 13 episodes was too much time to fill and left the show to wonder a bit as it tried to fill time. A shorter 8 episode run would have made the story telling a whole lot tighter, eliminated the need for filler characters that did not make sense and provided the viewers with a much more fulfilling experience. It gets a 7 thanks to David Tennant and a great performance from him, without him I doubt I would have finished watching to the end.",2015
1,"i am a real hardcore marvel fan myself but even i couldn't bear my self to torture for non stop overrated piece of sh*t.this show had extreme potential but it just fell flat from the beginning. the pilot is where this show failed to attract my attention and from then on i understood that this is no daredevil. daredevil had everything in balance it showed Matt's past in detail which this show merely shows for a couple of times and that also not in good quantity only mentioned .i mean have the show creator even read the comics?. Jessica is a very troubled person which this show gets right but only superficially. i think they chose the wrong hero to be picked up for the show instead they should have gone for moon knight. the show has literally no action at all the finale is very bland . no appearance of daredevil even if he had helped her in the comics as a lawyer . only thing good about this show is the performance Mike Colter, Kristen Ritter, David Tennant just nailed their performance . also what was the point of all those exaggerated intimate scenes? between Luke and Jessica it is watchable and tolerable but what of Trish and the cop?, Hogarth and her wife and her p.a. Pam.Eka Darville was also fantastic as Malcolm .They couldn't even get purple man right as a menacing and dangerous villain where as kingpin was a beast as compared to purple man. Tennant had very little screen time and he tries to justify the character as good as possible. the show had no script at all. useless boring plot dragged on for over and over until it had reached for the finale. the plot for each episode is very thin and stretches out for the whole season but ultimately serves no purpose of the show .The show doesn't even show Jessica's past clearly and effectively as to why she hates purple man.The supporting cast is useless and serve no purpose to the show except for cage and probably Malcolm as Jessica's support in the later episodes. Carrie Ann moss was god awful beyond reason and her character was completely misused.I mean why change her gender from the comics at all and make her gay where as they could have set up close ties to iron fist as he is getting his own show? Not even a single mention has been made that her character has close ties to Danny's father or his lawyer.The redundant subplot of the cop (or nuke as from comics)going AWOL all of a sudden in the middle is very pathetic. if they do get a second season get a new show creator or else don't make one. i had really high hopes for this one after daredevil but this is just beyond redemption. get your head straight ""marvel"" i mean it. also to mention how did she develop a immunity to purple man's power all of a sudden.In the comics it was jean Grey who helped her to put up a psychic wall in her mind to stop purple man to control her ..... OK i get it marvel doesn't have the right but at least they could have come up with something else other than just random immunity to his powers.Also no mention OR even a nod of Peter Parker(now that Spiderman's rights have reverted back to marvel)being her first crush or they shared the same college.absolutely no tie ins (very small and forgettable) with the rest of the m.c.u. felt like an very isolated show.",2015
1,"Disappointed, to say the least. After Daredevil, which was terrific, comes this trash from the mind of... you guessed it Brian Michael Bendis, one of the worst Marvel Comics writers ever! I hope with the disappointment that this so obviously is, Bendis will not be let near anymore live action Marvel material. Just plain terrible!, Netflix, you were doing so well! If you like or love the Marvel Universe, do your best to AVOID this junk! The actors are all decent performers but the plot, dialogue, characters, scenes, all of it, couldn't hold my interest. Seems like every relationship was written in to get a useless, gratuitous scene.",2015
2,"The pilot started out pretty good, but it's just the same thing, over and",2015
1,"Am I watching the same show as so many who post here? There are reviews of Jessica Jones with 9 and 10 stars with statements like, ""Incredible, Marvelous, Brilliant, and (my favorite) Arguably the best Superhero Show to date."" What in the ""blankety-blank"" are you watching?! Don't do drugs, and don't review shows after watching them while on drugs!! If you give this show 3 stars or more and gave Guardians of the Galaxy a 6 or more, you should be kicked off IMDb! Don't get me wrong, Guardians was entertaining, but it was the highest rated movie on IMDb history before people with some sense started reviewing it. I cannot, for any reason, understand how anyone can rate this show average, much less good. It's terrible! Now for the non-drug users: stop reviewing a show after 1 episode. Truth be told, the first episode was bad enough, but they progressively got worse. And stop giving a show high marks based solely on how bangable the actors are. Get a life! This show almost drove me to drug addiction... caffeine to be exact, as I needed plenty of it to stay awake for the 8 episodes I tortured myself through. I've watched turtle races that were more entertaining than this! Oh, it's dark, and even darker now that I've turned the TV off. Just because something is dark does not make it good. You actually have to act, have good writing, make characters interesting, and (if your a so-called superhero) do some superhero stuff. Punching a guys wife in the chest and killing her with one punch is not enough to convince me, as that's probably happened in real life! Oh wait, she can jump 8 feet in the air and break some handcuffs.... Wow, not interesting! David Tennant is the only positive of this show, as he did quite well with what he had to work with, even though his character kind of comes off as a spoiled little boy that won't share his toy. You know, he's done voice-overs and narrations before. I think they could have shown a claymation figure of him as Kilgrave and he still would have given the best performance on the show.",2016
3,"Jessica Jones was never a big player in the Marvel universe. I have no idea what they brought her character into a series, but it is poorly written and very poorly acted. The actress, playing Jones, is one of the worse actresses that I have ever seen on screen. The characters are all unlikeable, the script is boring and ridiculous. For those thinking that this is going to be something good to add to the Marvel universe - add it to the Fantastic Four, Electra, Ant-Man and Daredevil (the movie).",2015
4,"What I really like about this show, is the dark atmosphere and the cinematography. Krysten Ritter is a good fit for the role of Jessica Jones. However, the show is nowhere near as good as Daredevil. Daredevil is addictive, Jessica Jones is more like something you keep watching because you have watched the good stuff already. The cinematography, the acting and directing is not the problem, what is bugging me are some really important and annoying flaws in the script. According to the story the antagonist's weapon, his voice, which he uses to command people as he pleases, works only when his victims are able to hear him. What would be easier than wearing ear-buds listening to loud music, thus being unable to hear the magic spells? Also, when Jessica is at arms length with Kilgrave and she could render him unconscious by punching him, she doesn't. Since the whole story about Kilgraves invincibility is based on the premise that you have to be able to hear his voice in order to be influenced, the whole logic-defying story collapses like a house of cards. Jessica Jones will never be as exiting and suspenseful as series like Daredevil or Gotham, unless they find a script writer who can produce plots that are based on logic rather than erratic ideas. Last but not least, there are a lot of annoying sex scenes for no reason.",2015
1,Here are two quotes from Jessica Jones to set the tone for this review:,2016
9,"I will just start by saying that this is nothing like the book (which I like) and it is done in an excellent way. They basically just took the names and two or three basic ideas, but that's it. Even the Main Character has a different background and skills. ",2016
4,"The beginning handful of episodes showed promise, but the writing has galloped downhill into a swamp of snark and sarcasm and cliché.",2017
8,"I immensely enjoyed the beginning. It was also a nice idea on Syfy's part to make the first episode available on Youtube before the actual series premiere, as it was what got me to take an interest in it in the first place.",2016
2,"*I haven't read any of the books, this review is based solely on the presentation of the TV series*",2016
2,"I wanted to give this more stars in order to support and encourage new fantasy shows. But this is not so much fantasy as a teenage soap-opera/horror series. SPOILERS. Some may say this is a darker Harry Potter and Narnia mixed in with ""raw adulthood."" No. There is very little adulthood in Season 1 of this series. Lots of whining and entitlement from magically powerful adolescents prancing around in adult costumes, unhappy that their life has no meaning as they engage in drug-fueled sex and rarely think of anyone but themselves. There is also very little Harry Potter, other than the similarity of ""magic school,"" as that story had more respect for the intelligence of the audience, even a young adult audience, than this supposedly adult show. Need an example? Do you understand the basic rules of Quidditch after reading/watching Harry Potter? Yes. Now I ask you, do you understand the basic rules of Welters after watching The Magicians? No. We are shown Quentin making a magic dot that turns into a storm, some intervention by Alice, and then the audience applauding in approval for Quentin's apparent brilliance. Nonsense that we, the audience are supposed to gloss over and accept, as if a tiny bit more elucidation would have bored us or overwhelmed our puny brains. Moreover, there is enough gratuitous brutality, gore, pedophilia, and rape that I suspect the producers were trying to add in Game of Thrones to the mix. I'm not clutching my pearls here - I'm a GOT fan - but the childish behavior of the characters plus the gore and rape is a nasty combo. And it is a failure to hinge the characters' motivations on the sexual abuse that they suffer. Really, the bad guy turned bad because he was molested as a child? Over-used and untrue stereotype. Really, the bad girl turned bad and betrayed her friends because she was raped - on screen - by a demon? So unnecessary. The final nail in the coffin (or I wish, but apparently there is a Season 2 coming) is the disillusioned feeling that drenches the whole season. Magic is not wonderful or beautiful or even particularly helpful (no really - every foe they face deprives the magicians of their magic and leaves them helpless and useless). Instead of the wonder you feel when you watch Harry Potter flying on a hippogriff, or the stunning ambiance of Narnia, there is no beauty or wonder in the world of The Magicians. Even the ten whole seconds they show of pre-Beast Fillory lacks any sort of enchanting feeling. And even the path to magic ability - SUFFERING, rather than goodness or practice or any desirable trait - is pointlessly depressing. It's not about patiently suffering, or triumphing over adversity - no, it's plain old suffering that gives a magician power. I walked away from the final episode of Season 1 thoroughly disgusted with magic and with no desire to visit the world these kids live in, and no desire to see Fillory, and no real concern for the fates of the characters. Not that there wasn't character development - I feel like I know each of the characters, but wouldn't really mind if they died, or lived, or triumphed, or whatever. As 20 somethings, they act like middle schoolers. The only reason I might watch Season 2 is to find out who killed the gods. The point of fantasy is to escape to another world, to pretend that magic is real, perhaps to live the life of a character who you want to be. I'm not sure what the point of this show is, other than to make magic unfun, undesirable, and unnecessary. I would honestly rather live in Westeros than with The Magicians, and as a woman, that's saying a lot.",2017
10,"Clever and innovative approach to a not-so-innovative premise of a hidden magical reality, parallel to the world we live in - told from the perspective of a graduating high school student, struggling to decide what to do with his life. The narrative is well set, placed in the modern world with (young) adult protagonists; which immediately gives it somehow more real-feel, and makes it more relatable and interesting. And the idea it proposes - that the cause behind being an awkward teenager with identity crisis is actually sensitivity to magic - is a brilliant touch, with timeless quality and something that should resonate well with the audience.",2015
8,"If you've read Lev Grossman's wonderful Magicians trilogy you may find watching this series rather disorienting. The characters are all there and quite recognizable, and it's still about magic students and mysterious otherworlds, but it often feels like the series' writers cut the books into pieces, stirred those pieces in a bowl, then pulled them out and stitched the pieces together in random order, making up new stuff to fill in gaps.",2016
1,How to sum up the first season:,2017
2,I really wanted to like this show but it really lacks any type of magic. It focuses on stupid teen drama with poorly scripted lines. Where is the magic? There is no development into Q learning magic or what his purpose is. Instead of developing a story regarding magic instead it focuses on random sex scenes. ,2016
4,"I love magic and a show about magic should make me very happy. But I can't get past the fact that every character in this show is not only unlikable, but are world class idiots. Each and every one of them. It is not bad acting, the cast is good, but they can only do so much with this very poor writing. None of the actions they take are intuitive or even logical at times. Change the writing team and this show can be salvaged. After watching the entire first season (If I start a show I want to see it thru no matter how terrible) I was left wondering what exactly was the point of anything the main cast did and went thru. It was all so pointless and random. There was no growth, no coming together as friends or classmates. Just more chaos in action and thought.",2016
9,"After two episodes, this new series by the Syfy Channel has already captured my interest and my imagination. ""The Magicians"" is a supernatural tale adapted from the books of Lev Grossman, which I have not read. It will inevitably be compared to the Harry Potter saga, but it operates on a different level.",2016
9,"I wanted to first start off by saying that I have read all 3 books and am a huge fan of the magicians series. I also wanted to say this is NOT a review where I say, ""oh the books were so much better!"", because they weren't better or worse than the show. They are different (for good reasons) but still capture ""The Magicians"". In this review I want to address changes that the show made from the books and my opinions (staying as objective as I can) as to why they made those changes. I would also say don't read this review unless you have seen the first episode at least. There won't be ""spoilers"" but I will talk about things assuming episode 1 has been watched. Also for those who read this much later than when I wrote it, this is after seeing the first 6 episodes.",2016
10,This is a concept for a show that we(the fans of magic shows/movies) have been waiting for. A show that progresses very quickly through the actual learning part of magic and can then ricochet into where they actually use the magic. They rightfully picked a cast of people who seem to know how to come off with just the right amount of nerd vs sex appeal to make the show a little of both but enough to where it enhances the story lines.,2016
3,"I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of the first episode.. then everything turned into ""lets talk about our feelings"" It seems like every show made anymore turns into a bad CW type show. (pouting early 20's, dark lighting a lot of emotional crap that is unneeded) ",2016
7,"I'm loving this so much better than the books, what a strange sensation that is. Yes, this is very much like a older, darker harry potter mixed with Chronicles of Narnia. Lets put that aside, it's an old story with a new twist. Embrace it and move on. ",2016
2,"I had high hopes for this series. Never having read the books but enticed by the previews, it seemed to have everything I would normally enjoy: Magic, Good vs. Evil, Coming-of-age story... Well, I was thoroughly disappointed. The main character (as well as all others) is completely unlikable. Turns his back on his apparently longtime friend, when she failed the entrance exam, in the most obnoxious and condescending way. Then he attaches himself to the two most annoying students at the school - his new ""friends"". As someone else said: None of the characters' decisions and actions seem to have any believable emotional basis. They go from not knowing that Magic is real to matter- of-factly taking an entrance exam for a school they've never heard of, to then talking about it as if it had been their goal for their entire life? After the series premiere I have no desire to watch the next episode.",2016
1,"I have read this trilogy 3 times and it is one of my favorite series. I was extremely excited that this was going to be adapted into a series, but now that I have watched the first 3 episodes I have lost all faith in this TV series. They have twisted and changed SO MUCH, even by normal standards, that to me there is no way it can be redeemed. The novels are genius, intelligent and unique, and this series twists it all into a generic mess of crap that barely resembles the original. You could change the names of everyone and there would be no resemblance to the novels. I can understand people giving it high marks because they are excited about seeing the books come to life, but this is not that. They killed the novels and resurrected them as a mindless zombie-like shadow of the real story. Maybe if you haven't read the books you'll enjoy the bland, banal story line that this show offers, but as a huge fan of the novels, this is a desecration of a great story. It's Frankenstein's monster, all confused and twisted, ripped apart and sewn back together to create an abomination that just wants to die. So Very Disappointed...",2016
2,"I was really disappointed to have spent so much time on this show. It started out great... a fun mix of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter but for adults. Then, in one episode, episode 11, the entire show was ruined for me. ",2016
3,"I imagine when someone in Hollywood got his 5 minutes to pitch the show, he must have said something along the lines of:",2016
6,"NO SPOILER Wayyy wayyyyy worse than the books, after the first 3 episodes, im out.",2016
1,"In general I love fantasy and went into this thinking it has the IMDb rating of 7.5 must be good. I am here to tell you that this is proof that IMDb ratings are total crap. This is a waste of time, waste of electricity.",2017
5,After seeing the pilot I had high hopes for this new series. Troubled teenagers who don't fit into society are being told they're magicians. So basically it seemed like a grown up version of Harry Potter. (Though the last few books and movies were def no children's stories anymore),2016
9,"OK I must be the only person who has read the book! Now the book is a hard read. I felt you are NOT meant to like the main character Quentin. He is a very self absorbed introvert, who in the book just walks away from his friends and leaves everything behind for his pursuit of magic.",2016
8,"I was able to watch the first pilot episode and this show was a lot darker and grittier than I thought it would be. The ending in particular really surprised me with how far they were able to go. I feel like the plot is progressing too fast. The main character's entry into the school of magic could've been stretched out just a tiny bit longer into a much better story. The series of test he went through was very lackluster, and they could've been more creative with the selection process.",2016
4,"Cannot remember the last time a show started with so much promise and could not reach the end of season one without screwing it up. Instead of drawing things out to properly explain and build characters, the final two episodes leave you scratching your head because all the primary characters lost their likability by doing such dumb or awful things. One makes a mistake, so the other does it on purpose? Another essentially makes a deal with a serial killer in order to get some twisted revenge? Another is just a jerk because they can be...so who am I rooting for? The premise of the show was great, and I enjoyed most of the first season, but I would be surprised if it makes it past season 2. I for one have no intention of watching a single episode of season 2 simply because I find myself not liking any of the main characters anymore--Good job writers.",2016
10,"I binged the series over a 2-day period and wished there was more. The characters were well developed and the whole thing was very entertaining. It covered many bases that divorce can bring about to family and friends, and dealt with issues of loss, honesty and aging, among others.",2015
9,"I will always love Lily Tomlin. I always enjoyed Jane Fonda in her youthful movie star mode, but since she came out of retirement, she elevates everything she's in. I think she was the primary reason I kept watching Newsroom for three seasons. I kept waiting for her every appearance. In Grace and Frankie, Tomlin and Fonda have to overcome a rather unbelievable situation--that is to face the fact that they husbands they have been married to for over forty years have somehow falling in love and intend to marry each other. Relegated to a kind of ""Odd Couple"" status, they end up living in a Malibu beach house their husbands bought years earlier. Each couple used the house on separate weekends. Now Grace and Frankie have to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives and move on. Jane Fonda as Grace is at her brittle comedic best. She delivers in spades, looks stunning in her latish 70s and plays off Lily Tomlin's hippy-esque character with spunk and funny nerve. Grace has to face the fact that she's an uptight, judgmental pain in the ass. And Tomlin's Frankie is just the person to remind her over and over again. The scripts are tightly funny. The interplay between the two ex-couples is expert. Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen have nearly thankless roles as the two spouses who dump their wives, but they handle the dialog ad the romantic banter with dignity. But let's face it, you're waiting for Grace and Frankie to spark off each other. It's not the kind of laugh-out-loud absurdest insults The Golden Girls hurled at each other with such glee, but the humor is key here. There is is just enough drama to remind us of the absurdity of life. I couldn't wait to watch this show when it was announced. Fonda and Tomlin were terrific with Dolly Parton in Nine to Five, but they are even better here. This is a terrific show. I'll stick around as long as these two glorious stars are here to make us laugh and cry.",2015
10,"This is a brilliant and timely series. Sheen, Waterston, Fonda, and Tomlin. I'd guess nearly 200 years of combined acting experience. It shows. The writing in this series is witty and attentive to popular culture. It gently picks away at the nonsense in our contemporary lives and exposes the raw human condition. The only thing that eats at me a little is the upper-class white privilege that penetrates throughout. Despite this, the series makes some very real, critical, and timely social commentary. At the very moment that the Supreme Court of the United States debates gay marriage, we have Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston - two very straight and very accomplished actors - kissing on the screen.",2015
10,"Though I see where one may feel it's dull or ""Flat"" as one reviewer called it. It's because this show has a sense of honesty and a realistic charm to make you forget its a show and not something happening to a friend. When something seems real it loses a bit of edge, real isn't sexy (girls wearing black thongs every night sexy/not real, ugly laundry or period panties so not sexy/ oh so real).This gem of a show has Tomlin, Fonda, Sheen and Waterson, Living Legends and they prove it in each scene. The history their characters have in some part feels more authentic do to the history the cast must actually have. Years working in the same industry, on a number of projects together (West Wing, Newsroom, 9 to 5, to name a few). The added connections brought by their children brilliantly played by Raphael, Vaughn, Decker and especially Ethan Embry legitimizes the story because no matter what we do it always effects our kids even if they're grown. The revolving door of great guest stars is that perfect little finishing touch to an already great freshman year. I cant wait for more , it does not help that I too binge watched in one sitting just created a longer wait for my self.",2015
10,Two couples who have known each other (and not necessarily loved each other) all their lives find out in their 70's that the two husbands are gay and in love. HA! And have been for the better part of 20 years sneaking around behind their families backs.,2015
10,"Grace and Frankie is a heartfelt comedy excellently portrayed by four veteran actors. This original comedy takes you into the lives of two couples and their families as they work through a major change in family dynamics. You'll find yourself wanting to learn more about the four main characters and how they adapt to their ensuing life changes. You'll find yourself empathizing with Grace and Frankie as they each reconcile with the end of their 40 year marriages. New opportunities for personal growth and understanding of different lifestyles create a platform for growth and understanding between all four characters. I watched all 13 episodes in 3 days and I did indeed laugh out-loud! Hats off to NetFlix for delivering a much needed adult comedy. Thank you to Lily, Jane, Sam and Martin for breathing the life into these characters.",2015

10,"I was pleasantly surprised by Grace and Frankie. So often lately I have been disappointed in spite of a stellar cast. In this case the cast lived up to their reputations and I have to commend Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen for their performances. Another reviewer who stated ""The thing about dramedies is that you want them to both be funny and dramatically compelling (i.e. Transparent). Grace and Frankie wasn't especially funny. And the trite hippie/uptight odd couple theme undercuts the drama; how sorry can you feel for clichés?"" I'm not sure if he actually watched more than the 1st episode and if he didn't he missed the best part as it did start off a bit slow but Grace and Frankie is compelling with several interesting stories to tell with humor thrown in where it was needed. I felt like I was peeking in on 2 real families as they dealt with life changing events. I liked this so much more than Transparent which I thought was one huge cliché. The writing here was so much better and didn't rely on continual shock value, excessive foul language, and gratuitous nudity to get the story told or to hold the viewers interest. The solid script and performances did that in Grace and Frankie.",2015
8,"Watching it all at once gave you sense of it being more a lengthy movie than a sitcom and that word doesn't even suit it. I found it delighful, the first episode wasn't memorable but had me intrigued enough to go for more and I am so glad.",2015
10,"I loved the show, I hope there will be another season. I am looking forward to the next season. I watched the whole season in one afternoon. I found the show to be very funny. I love Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda. The story line was very creative, and the casting was perfect. I have read the reviews and I am happy that some enjoyed the show as much as I did. I don't find a lot of the Netflix shows on TV but I am a true fan of Netflix and find most their shows are very entertaining. I have had Netflix for years and find they have excellent shows. Grace and Frankie was a true gem of a show. Wow ten lines is a lot of information for someone like me that is not a big talker.",2015
10,"This is an 11 out of 10 for rating. I find the entire cast amazing, and one of the best shows I've seen on net flex in a while. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin look amazing, and make a great team. I power watched the episodes in one day, and awaiting many more. Keep them coming - I can't wait for more. I love Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen, and as actors, they make it seem so real. The actors portraying the children -awesome choice for great acting and seemed to have the reactions fitting for this type of family drama Brooklyn, Ethan, June and Baron nice job. Looking forward to this series continuing, and the chemistry between Jane & Lily, you nailed it. Keep up the good work.",2015
8,"I find the performances of Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin terrific. I think the criticism of the acting is a misunderstanding of possible real life circumstances. Sam Waterston's character is probably what you might expect from someone married thirty five years, and in the same relationship for twenty years... my dull life continues. Martin Sheen seems to make his character more ""Birdcage"" and is not quite as enthusiastic as I would expect in view of ""the odd couples'"" engagement.",2015
10,"As a straight spouse, I love this show! The one thing I'd like to work in is Straight Spouse Network, www.straightspouse.org , an organization and support group that has saved many of us.",2015
2,"Given the talent involved with Grace and Frankie and the legendary status of its stars, this is one of the most bitter disappointments to ever be produced in any entertainment medium. Watching something this terrible is more like torture than entertainment. Is this supposed to be a comedy, a tragedy, a farce, or drama? It doesn't work as any of those and not as any combination thereof. The chuckles are few and far between but the squirm factor is quite high. It's painful to watch actors of such stature, a Martin Sheen and a Sam Waterston, deliver lines that are so forced and stilted. Tomlin and Fonda do little better with the dialog they are given and one can't help but feel the writers have betrayed all of them outrageously and are arrogantly indifferent to their hapless victims' suffering. Have these people no shame? Perhaps this looked good on paper but it's absolutely awful. Rarely does it seem possible an audience may be suffering flop sweats from watching a bad show but one senses that may be happening from the perspective of personal experience. Flop sweats on behalf of the respected actors? That may be some new ground broken with this show. Painful is a word that begs to be repeated. None of this is because this particular viewer is sensitive to the subject mater or prudish in anyway. That is not the case at all. It is more a matter of being subjected to watching some favorite actors humiliated by really poor material supplied by hacks. If this were a Broadway play, it would have closed after the first night and be soon forgotten because it hurts too much to remember it. The cast of this fiasco were not afforded that opportunity and unfortunately, Grace and Frankie is going to be on Netflix forever. At least it will seem that way.",2015
2,For such a stellar cast I would have expected some real acting. This is possibly the worst thing I have ever seen. ,2015
8,"The writers have a great concept, stellar cast and unlike most films / shows these days, they don't totally wreck it.",2015
5,"I really did want to like this show...the writing doesn't hold up to the talented cast.....silly and tiring and forced plot about Frankie and Grace and their contrived relationship. It's a forced plot line and actually quite tiring. Seems like it is predicated around the bickering between the forced, overblown Tomlin, and the excellent Fonda...Fonda's acting deserves a better vehicle. Sheen and Waterson are not believable at all...talented cast, bad scripts and plot line...",2017
1,"Who is writing this,twenty somethings?, I really tried to give it a go. The characters are so one dimensional (Martin Sheen is the only one that I can believe).The relationship between Sol and Robert is almost believable, but the relationship between Grace and Frankie is dull and superficial. And there are a lot of funny things that could happen besides making shoe jokes. Also Grace and Frankie are so stereotypical and it's just not funny. I watched this to get a laugh and could not find one. The children in the show confuse me, they are disconnected, it seems like they got written in later as an after thought. If the writers could sit in a room with me and my friends they would see just how funny life after 60 can be.",2015
5,I loved this show for the first couple seasons. I am impressed with Jane Fonda's performance. I never liked her before but she is so believable in this. I liked that the show dealt with older women's issues too. The gay angle was an interesting twist. ,2017
10,"I'm finding this to be the perfect show for me right now. Maybe because I am nearing the time of life of Grace and Frankie, if not their exact situation. I am trying to figure out which of them I am most like and find I fit somewhere between them both and wish I was MORE like each of them. I think the family dynamics between the parents and their respective children is very realistic as well as the children to each other. I am only on episode six and am already distressed that I will be finished too soon. I sure hope this isn't going to be the only season. I laugh out loud even though I watch it alone. That, to me, is a wonderful scenario. Laughter is contagious so when you are watching something with others and they laugh, it's easy to laugh along. When you find yourself laughing at something on your own, even at yourself, it's cathartic and fills me joy!",2015

9,"Getting divorced at the age of 70? Leaving your wife for a man at the age of 70? In the past, people with more than 20 years of marriage just stuck together. Maybe they were not in love anymore, maybe there was only respect and companion, but a new start at the age of 70 was never a chance. Grace & Frankie makes the opposite happen in a such a real way. Because they are 70 years old people, but they live in 2015. They have cellphones, computers, they masturbate, they have sex, they get high, they feel lonely, they cry, they laugh (and make us laugh) about what happens when you are 70 and don't spend your days in a rocking chair. ",2017
10,"What is truly wonderful about this Netflix series is the writing has gotten richer with each episode. It's a given the 4 main characters who are all in their 70s are excellent but so is the supporting cast. June Diane Raphael steals every scene she's in. She could have her own show. The depth of issues discussed is also handled with intelligence and humor. The final episodes of both seasons 1 & 2 are hysterical. Tomlin has been nominated for an Emmy this year. You get the distinct feeling there's a great deal of truth to her character and Fonda's. Both women look fantastic. This is a show about marriage and the ties that bind. It's about friendship, love and owning up to who we are. It's about the humor in living and remembering to be self-deprecating. Grace and Frankie is simply superb!",2016
9,"I felt compelled to write a review due to the many negative ones I read. I preface by saying that I never watch so called comedy and especially TV shows lasting under 45 min. for a variety of reasons, but did so because of a recommendation from a close friend. I was fearing the usual vulgarity of language, cliché', and the standard married with children routine. I was very surprised however. This is a very powerful dramedy with a fantastic cast. The acting is superb. The characters of the extended family slowly build and are well cast. Between the ability of the writers and the skill of the actors, much more was conveyed in the what I call ""paintbrushes"" style: concise sentences or mute behaviors. Lily Tomlin's ability to move from one emotion to another in ""grand intense style"", combined with Jane Fonda's own artistry and satire created a good chemistry. I also enjoy the juxtaposition of their lives with that of their live-in husbands. Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston are greatly paired and the pain that goes along with any marriage breaking apart after 40 years is never overlooked. Of course the reasons for the break-up allow the writers to address the issue of coming out late in life with all its complications. This is real life, not some far fetched scyfy or demeaning homophobia. Here nobody wins. Though it is obvious that many families may not react in the same way, this show is choosing to emphasize more complex feelings rather than focus on shouting matches, anger, betrayal,revenge, and divorce battles. It is much more subtle and those gems woven almost too quickly in the cinematography or screenplay require a receptive empathetic brain who can appreciate a show where comedy is not a jumble of crass words, shouting matches between couples with children, sex romps, and the likes. Thank you Netflix for giving us a show that actually can mix other feelings to laughter in a nice recipe. I never give 9 for comedies, but this one deserves it (IMO). I hope the Network picks this show for another season.",2015
1,"This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from which I've ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session was full of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves with anticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Are women really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off?? The acting was appalling - I guess that's the end of Ms Johnson & Mr Dornan's careers. And I wouldn't be surprised if the actors who refused the role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to reject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the two leads. As for the 'eroticism'.....it was completely lacking. Stilted, awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible. ",2015
1,"I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".",2015
1,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.",2015
2,"The only reason this movie gets two stars out of me is that, thanks to this mediocre effort, I'll be able to remind my girlfriend of what I put up with for her the next time I get to choose on movie night and I suggest a cheesy 80s comedy like ""Weird Science"" or ""The Naked Gun"". I don't really need to go into all of the details here because there are more than enough detailed descriptions of this thing to spare me the effort of doing so and to spare you reading the same thing over more times than necessary. Instead, I'll just go ahead and throw my lot in with the ""haters"", as the fans seem to be labelling us here.",2015
1,"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago. ",2015
1,"You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY.",2015
1,"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.",2015
1,"Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man.",2015
1,"Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Sue relationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit when rape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that 'Hollywood' will create anything without investigating the rather obvious 'unusual behavior' -- which, lets be honest here, isn't unusual until you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for the life of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is no chemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so much better. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook on BDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a 'book'. You truly have given writers everywhere a reason to wish they'd never written, and a reason as to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates to this horrible mess of a movie.",2015
1,"As an active member of BDSM community, and having been a part of it for six years, I am appalled by the 'blockbluster romantic movie' that everyone deems to be 'romantic'. You take a Mary Sue - also known as Dakota Johnson to whom lacks the ability to a) bite her lower lip in a 'sexual' manner', let alone say her lines as if she's been acting for several years ( lets be honest here, she cannot act ) / Gary Sue - seen as the bearded wonder that was Jamie Dornan, a married man outside of his acting career with a child - situation that holds no evidence of sexual tension. ",2015
1,"When the end credits began to roll, I was given a fleeting look by the people sitting next to me in the cinema. They were probably checking to see if I was still alive; such was my horror and, quite frankly, disbelief, I had not moved from the same position for at least an hour. A wide-opened mouth, bulging eyes and clenched fists on the armrests at my sides. No, I was not enamoured with the movie. No, I did not find the scenes of bondage shocking. I had simply lost the will to live. ",2015
1,"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.",2015
1,"One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairly sophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign of being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting. This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I use the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as a main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This is the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remained with the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.",2015
5,"Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James' erotic bestseller ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. ""Nowhere Boy"" director Sam Taylor-Johnston and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James' novel and turned it into an antiseptic, ""Cinderella"" fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" isn't as abysmal as the amateurish ""Addicted."" Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because ""Fifty Shades"" is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both ""Shame"" (2011) and ""The Lover"" (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won't see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie ""Body of Evidence"" (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction,"" or the infamous ""Last Tango in Paris"" where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James' two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn't hoist anybody's eyebrows.",2015
7,"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".",2015
10,"I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say ""this is okay"" and ""woman should do this"". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.",2015

1,"I've never read the book and the marketing around the movie was so good that I had to see it. But the movie is so bad, it is not worth it. The actors are really terrible and the dialogues couldn't even exist in real life. You'll be siting for two hours to watch nothing happening in the movie besides 2 minutes of sex scenes. I can say that I laughed the whole time because it was ridiculous. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack which really matches the whole thing on the screen.",2015
1,"This movie, and indeed the book, is NOT about BDSM. I'm 25 and have been involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothing but abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape. ",2015
1,I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).,2015
1,"Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice.

The board meeting probably went something like this.",2015
1,"I tried to give the show a chance when it had it's series premiere in 2015, but it was terrible and so cheesy and cringey that all of the characters I grew to love as a kid growing up got ruin by appearing as different characters on the show.I didn't watch glee while it was on and haven't heard Melissa Benoist sing at all, but she does a terrible job at playing as Supergirl and ruins the image of who Supergirl really is.And the show uses characters who appear as background characters in the comics be main characters on the show that are very boring and seem like very lifeless characters.I love how DC acts like all of their programs,movies, and other DC brands are very dark and gritty and Marvel is dumb,funny, and light, but Supergirl and other shows in the Arrowverse prove to be very silly and light, and the Marvel-Netflix show are what DC thinks their shows are.And it seems like the show is trying to turn Supergirl into Wonder Woman, just like how Arrow is trying to turn Green Arrow into Batman,The Flash into Superman, and the Legends of Tomorrow into the Justice League.After watching episodes from each Arrowverse show (Arrow,The Flash,Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow), it seems like The CW does a terrible job with DC superhero shows.Fox on the other hand seems to do a way better job with superhero shows just look how great of a job the channel does with the show Gotham.",2017
1,"Ugh...where to begin? I liked Season 1 of Supergirl. Given its cheesy moments at times, Kara was an empowering character as she was coming into her own as a superhero. And Alex..Alex was actually my favorite female character. What was great about Season 1, for me, was that there were so many amazing, strong female characters, which is rare for television these days. Then Season 2 came around. I don't even want to get into how awful that season was with Kara taking a back seat to Mon El's story while having to watch her eventually hook up with him and become a side character in her own show. Plenty of other reviews have voiced their disdain for that disrespectful frat boy better than I ever could. I did love the addition of Lena Luthor and Alex's coming out story line. ",2017
2,The second season is even worse than the first one. ,2017
4,"Okay, I've read the reviews too.. My main complaint is that the writers seem to never have read any of the comics. Apparently unfamiliar with what the title ""Super"" refers to, they put an otherwise promising character into the most absurd situations. Supergirl is very nearly as strong as Superman, yes, but she is also just s fast. That means super- speed. Does ""faster than a speeding bullet"" ring a a bell? I watched as Suppergirl just stood by and watched a switch thrown in this last episode, the one used to activate the killing weapon. Just stood there as if she couldn't move. This is just bad writing, you writers. Super- speed, get it? She could have been there before that switch was thrown easily. Think of how the Kryptonians moved in ""Man of Steel,"" or ""Smallville."" That's how Supergirl should move. Her reflexes match that. It's almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise. So get with it. There are other plot devices which would be infinitely more interesting if writers just dealt with the character's powers instead of hobbling her this way. And, yes, this is written immaturely and unprofessionally. You don't have to write down to kids in the audience. They appreciate the mote intelligent story lines, so give it to 'em and save everybody the pain of watching these episodes.",2016
1,"Why do I watch the show? I thought it was about superheroes and super villains. But no, I'm not sure what it is about anymore. This show continues to go downhill. The plot lines are simple and easy to determine within a couple minutes of the start of the show. I find myself shaking my head at the ridiculousness of the story line. The show has become all about relationship interactions that are on again and off again within a matter of minutes. The show used to be funny but now has turned into a lame drama. I don't usually write reviews but I have been very disappointed about where the show has gone. I don't think I'll be watching anymore.",2017
1,"I am not one to go out of my way to write a bad review; I'd generally prefer not to spend any more time than necessary on a terrible terrible show. For Supergirl I make an exception for two reasons: I am too disappointed not to, and I simply can't help but feel obligated to echo the sentiments of many other disappointed comic book fans. I'll explain...",2017
2,I really like super hero stuff and wanted to like this show. I love when they do those cross over episodes and so decided to give the rest of this show a try...,2017
1,"I only watch for the crossovers from Flash, Arrow and DCLoT. Glad they moved it to the CW to try and work more in...but the writers in all of the DCTVU seem to be whiny liberal idiots with an agenda and lack of self-worth. Blatant insertion of LGBTQAIWXYZ propaganda that doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the story. The whole remake of the Jimmy Olsen character would be laughable if it wasn't so sad. Someone with a crap ton of money should just buy the rights for DC Comics from the WB and do it right. This really isn't that hard.",2017
2,I went into this series hoping that it would be another Smallville or something similar but was pretty disappointed with season 1. It did seem like there was potential so I decided to give season 2 a try and have been more and more disappointed with each episode I watch.,2017
2,"I gave the show 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy Season 1. I've never been a fan of comic book television or films, but I gave Supergirl a shot since we rarely see female led shows...let alone a female-driven superhero show. So I was pleasantly surprised by the first season. It wasn't perfect by any means. But it was enjoyable to watch and had plenty of strong women from Supergirl herself to her sister Alex to Lucy Lane and the ""Queen of all Media,"" Cat Grant. ",2017
1,"The writing for this show just continues to go downhill into Season 3. It's like the writers don't even know what they've written already. For example having Maggie's father commenting about how they want to build a wall. Just stop with the constant Donald Trump jabs already. I'm as liberal and progressive as they come, but even I find the constant political garbs off putting and unnecessary. It's sort of like in the debacle that was Season 2 where they had Kara tell Mon El that maybe being Supergirl and being with him was enough when in Season 1 she told J'Onn that being Kara Danvers and having her job at CatCo was just as important to her as her Supergirl duties when he offered her to work full time at the DEO.

4,"Season 1 was quite good and held well to the superhero genre. Season 2 started well but drifted deeply into interpersonal drama. Season 3 started the way season 2 ended, with less emphasis on the superhero and deeply into character emotions/relationships and social issues. These are important discussions, to be sure, but I watch superhero shows to see action and fun, not for deep emotion or for a critical societal exposé.",2017
3,"First of all i would like to say that i have watched 19 episodes of this show and i am entitled to my opinion (unlike people who saw the pilot and left it) and i have to say that this show is just not good.Are there episodes that are sort of good? Of course,but it says something that your best episode is a collaboration with another studio. to keep in that mindset the biggest problem with the show is its writing. the dialogue is so bad with quips and one liners that are cringeworthy, a story that is propaganda in on itself (which i will touch later), characters that i just don't care about, and love triangles that are just unnecessary.",2016
1,"As so many others here, I really wanted to like this series. Sadly, it's become nothing more than a millennial vehicle for the religion of AGW, rabid, yet sometimes stealthily introduced third-wave feminism, case- studies for the New Castrati metro-boyz, over-the-top cheesy-puppy dialogue, and overt lesbianism that has absolutely nothing to do with any workable story-line and serves only to push the identity politics and agendas of a studio management that dreams of a world comprised of diverse-for-diversity's-sake nightmare Enterprise bridge crews. We watched every episode, overlooking the mediocre acting and PC-ness as a simple act of escape-ism. But, we saw that as the second season unfolded, this silly show wasn't going to make it, alas and alack. When the producers and check-signers decided to actively use what could have been a really fun show to promote their own, tiny-fringe beliefs onto the rest of us - you know, the people who watch the adverts and spend the coin - it was time to switch it off and look elsewhere. So-called ""progressive"" propaganda and latent sexual identity issues indoctrination has no place in what is purportedly pushed as a prime- time kids and young-adult TV show. But, then again, that is how the left gets things done, isn't it?",2016

That must explain why she had a relationship with Mon el because Chris wood is even worse than she is. The writing is also so terrible. The only likeable things about the show is Alex, martian manhunter and max lord from season 1. There's no point in firing anyone. Just cancel the show altogether

Season 2 rating:1.5/10 (because of the likeable things I mentioned and having Superman.",2017
1,"Supergirl had so much potential to be a show women and young girls could really look to for strong, inspiring female characters and representation. Unfortunately, it failed miserably with that in Season 2, and Supergirl is definitely not someone I'd ever aspire to be as an empowered woman. ",2017
1,"OK... I gave this show a fair chance. The casting is poorly executed and lazy. Supervisor is not blonde, but I can overlook that... I'm sorry, but JIMMY Olsen is supposed to be red haired, freckled and geeky. Several stories in the comics were based on this. Now we zoom into the future, regardless of his color, suddenly Jimmy Olsen turns into a physically cut confident manly man that insists on being called James. This is just too big of departure from the roots of the story. Making characters another race is expected in this age of TV diversity, but you need to keep their essence. They didn't and ruined the story for me. I can't take this adaptation serious.... Jimmy Olsen is a geek and us comic fans are geeks, he is one of our own, not a cut gym rat. It gets a 1 star in my book. Killing a story in a poor attempt to be diverse.",2015
7,"This series is riveting, well directed, fast-paced and informative. The casting is marvelous with one little exception: OJ Simpson!! Cuba Gooding is a fantastic actor, but he completely fails to portray OJ Simpsons incredible charm and charisma that actually enabled him to sliver through years of abusive behavior and the cold-blooded double murder. Gooding is reactive and unsophisticated, while the cocksure Simpson is just missing. This is an incredible failure of casting where the remaining characters are spot on and compelling. Why not Dwayne Johnson or someone with the physical charisma and cool? Travolta deserves great kudos for taking this on, but one has to wonder why he allowed the utter miscasting of the major role. At any rate, this is a worthwhile series to watch and it surely is award-rich.",2016
10,"The case of O.J. Simpson is one that received wide scale media coverage and attention with the events being closely followed by many and is now the topic of season 1 of FX's new biographical crime drama, American Crime Story.

The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.",2016

It adds some things, intimate conversations, solitary acts, some of them certainly fabricated, and eliminates some of Toobin's more cynical observations.",2016
9,"Sarah Paulsen (Clark), Sterling Brown (Darden) and Courtney Vance (Cochran) are absolute stand-outs in this excellent TV series. Great writing and terrific acting. The one criticism I have is Cuba Gooding, Jr, although a wonderful actor, doesn't have the physicality required to convincingly portray O.J. Simpson. Other than that poor judgment in casting, excellent direction and production make this a series worth watching. Even if you believe you know everything about the case, you'll gain a deeper sense of the sorrow the families (and still are) lived through. And a greater respect for the district attorneys, who by no fault of their own, found themselves under the microscope while working inside a circus ring. Like Nicole and Ron - the LA District Attorney never had a chance.",2016
10,This show is brilliant.,2016
1,"Conceptually, it fails because when you have the most documented and talked about crime in American history, reenacting it cannot contain drama since there cannot be any surprises unless you contain new information or a biased slant. This show does neither. JFK the movie, for example, worked because it incorporated all the conspiracy theories into one coherent movie, it was a unique statement on an overexposed part of our history. The People v. O.J.

Mr Gooding bears no resemblance at all to Mr Simpson, apart from being an African-American His facial structure is all wrong, very different from O.J. who had a most strikingly handsome and distinctive face. Jamie Fox would have been an excellent choice, I feel. ",2016
1,"I really wanted to like this show. I've read so many good reviews by many well-respected media outlets and I cannot figure out why. This script is so cheesy and just ridiculous. I have a legal background and cannot keep track of the legal blunders....hugely distracting already. Also, why does John Travolta's mouth seem to be almost completely wired shut? Shapiro didn't, and doesn't, talk that way! That's a mannerism that would be more appropriate in an SNL sketch....not in a serious drama. I'm utterly disappointed. ",2016
1,"This is horrible. Schwimmer is horrible, Travolta is ridiculous and Cuba Gooding is just plain bad. I almost keep thinking it's a parody of the trial and not the dramatic biography that it is suppose to be. I love Travolta and Cuba Gooding (normally) but this may be their worse acting yet, neither is right for the role and Schwimmer really just ruins it for me. I really think if they had maybe 3 unknown actors to play these roles, it may have been a bit better. Travolta is trying way too hard to look and behave like Shapiro and it just ruins it for me.",2016
1,I honestly don't get it. ,2016
9,"Everyone remembers the mid 90's 1994 and 1995 and how they were glued with the culture and happenings of the O.J. Simpson murder case. And the criminal trial televised live on TV would fascinate and captivate a whole nation as did he do it, and the trial would spin on to race, police cover up and evidence tampering. I must say that this new FX series captures all of that near perfect. As the chemistry between the characters in is top notch form. As the actors playing the real life players look so real as the mannerisms are captured just perfect. And it shows how the defense team plots to make the trial about race and evidence tampering, and behind the scenes you see the power struggle with O.J. defense lawyers. And you see the head strong Marcia Clark make legal blunders and the real life news footage shown takes you back to the media circus of the trial of the century. Overall this series is near addictive watch it it's entertaining and a behind the scenes joy of the most talked about murder case of our generation.",2016
1,"Look, only one episode in, but man is this show ever hilarious. The show looks great from a production standpoint. The writing however makes the affair feel somewhat amateurish. About 3/4 of the way through the first episode, in a 5 minute period, I jotted down these three events that literally had me laughing out loud. While Marcia Clark and her cohort are questioning potential witnesses, there are two consecutive witnesses who seem to incriminate OJ. In both cases the ""oh my god, he's guilty look"" they give each other is absolutely hysterical. The only opportunity missed in the moment was the sweeping Duh...Duh...Duh orchestral score. What a shame, it would have been perfect! Then within 2 minutes, we're at the funeral when Faye Resnick and Kris K decide they must divulge in the most ridiculous expository conversation ever overheard at a funeral. Faye: ""Did you ever see the pictures of her face after he laid into her...and you know she hid them away, just in case something happened?"" No Faye, her closest friend in the whole world had no idea about that, but we just needed to make sure the audience was in on it. Then mere seconds later when a paparazzi asks ""Who the hell brings their lawyer to a funeral?"" It comes across as soooo corny. Yeah, we get it writers, he's sure acting guilty. So I say, adjust your lens, if you view it as comedy, we may have a classic for the ages!!!",2016
5,"Cuba Gooding Jr not the best choice for the role but the whole thing failed for me because of John Travolta's ridiculous makeup, fake teeth that he couldn't work with properly and sniff the fart acting (Joey, Friends). Don't think I heard a word he said because of it and couldn't take my eyes off him whether he was speaking or not and not in a good way. Unknown actors would have been better for every role.",2016
1,This is a negative review. No spoilers here. This show is a waste of air time / space. Created account today just to warn you how bad it really is. How can this show get any good reviews. Has anyone watched it? Must be show's staff writing the positive reviews... This played out in real time on live TV and that coverage was more interesting. Guilt or innocence aside why watch this misery? Can't Hollywood produce something more entertaining? I'm curious to see who actually liked this junk made for TV docudrama. Sky TV has had it's fair amount of lemons but this is the worst drivel. I was expecting more from American TV producers.,2016
1,"It's one of those shows I'd not heard of, but happened to find and thought could be an interesting way to pass an hour or two.",2016
2,OJ himself has less to be ashamed of than the people who contributed to this cinematic disaster. ,2016
4,"I had high hopes for this series as I believed it would accurately portray to the best of it's ability the story and trial of OJ Simpson. I was only 4 years old when this took place and As a true crime enthusiast, I didn't know much about the true story. So far I'm not impressed. The portrayal and the over hype of the ""Kardashians"" is tacky and disgusting. It makes me cringe every time one of the Kardashian children is shown in this TV show. They were kids at the time who had no real part in this story. Shame on you Ryan Murphy for using their name to promote a TV show. This show could be great, and I hope out improved and continues to portray accurate true crime stories. For now I'll watch it until I find something better on TV.",2016
2,"Im only giving this show a 2 out of 10 for the simple fact it may prompt a younger generation to spend some time researching the actual events .... Trust me from the beginning to the end the real thing is SOOOO much better, instead of clouding your mind with little tidbits of false information... I must admit it re-sparked my interest in the whole thing and i binge watched the whole ""real"" thing as closely as i could to how anyone watching it on live TV would have. Why watch a show u have to wait for when the main points already happened minus the terrible acting among other inaccuracies. Thats all i have to say about this, it could of been a lot better",2016
3,"Straight off the bat, is this The People vs O.J Simpson or a Origin story for Keeping up with the Kardashian's? I watched the 1st episode with true excitement. The cast names traveling the screen was like a IMDb top 50 list. it started well until we meet David Schwimmer's ""Bobby Kardashian"", his monotone delivery and facial expressions baffled me. Travolta as Shapiro will haunt my nightmares for years to come, bad delivery, even worse make-up. Sitting with my American girlfriend, even she didn't have a clue as to what was going on. Cuba isn't actually half bad, although if I hear the word ""Juice"" again I will probably have to go to the toilet, as I felt I was watching a Minute Maid commercial. Now the Kardashian angle is my biggest turn off. Why the need to have Selma Blair at all baffled me, the ""kids"" running around at the funeral and the constant need to throw in the Kardashian name at every opportunity. Then to top it all off you have the Pubescent KKK SPELLING their name. S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y?? I will continue to watch, just through plain intrigue, but this needs to focus more on O.J and less on the hangers on who found fame through their Father.",2016
8,"The first show of 2016 that could stick around for the top ten list of the year is The People v. OJ Simpson. The look of it is similar to American Horror Story as it's also on FX. The show has movie quality to it with actors from the big and small screen coming together, all of them appear at the top of their game. ",2016
8,"So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.",2015
10,"I loved every second of the first two episodes of Better Call Saul. We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about ""Better Call Saul"" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come.",2015
10,"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect with this, following on after one of the best series of all time, on a character who seemed to be a bit of comic relief in an otherwise brutal and dark show, I did have my doubts. Now that two episodes have been released however, any concerns should be put aside by anyone interested, because this is fantastic.",2015
10,"Let's retire Better Call Saul's 'spin-off' label. Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.",2015
10,"Just watched the first episodes and I feel completely lyrical. There is definitely a Breaking Bad kind of feel to it. It also offers a lot of candy for all the hardcore Breaking Bad fans. Still, they don't overdo anything. Everything feels thought out. The mix between comedy and drama is just right. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that if the show continues on this path, it will be a huge success. I would recommend this to anyone regardless if you're a fan of Breaking Bad or not. I think we're all in for a treat and I believe this show will have no trouble standing on it's own. Thank you for this, Vince Gilligan! I never doubted you.",2015
9,Breaking Bad in my opinion is the perfect show and is my all-time favourite and Walter White's seedy lawyer Saul Goodman has always been one of my favourite characters of the show. The second i found out he would be getting his own spin off i was excited and Better Call Saul has been one of the most hotly anticipated releases of 2015. I have to say based on the 2 episodes that have aired so far I have to say it has not disappointed and if the show continues to be this good then I will have another perfect show in my watchlist.,2015
10,Six episodes in to Better Call Saul now - and like Breaking Bad did - it just gets better and better. Tonights episode was something really special IMO,2015
8,"Watching the first episode of 'Better call Saul' just plunges you right back into the world of 'Breaking Bad'. If you watched the latter of course, nostalgia will be an inevitable delicacy. I do hope that it will unfold as greatly as its father and though not walk in breaking bad's path of making you love a narcissistic anti-hero, this one will prove to be of quite the same flavor. To top it off, feels good seeing old faces. I just wonder if they have in mind to converge it with the breaking bad time-line which would be just plain awesome.",2015
10,"The show was a long wait to come; since BB I've been craving more Vince Gilligan & Peter Gould's masterminds to bring something else to the table; they have done it. I had to realize this is Better Call Saul & separate it from BB; yes it's Saul & Mike but in totally different roles. I have made the transition exceptionally well; my husband and I both are anxiously waiting; reminders are constantly set now; as to not miss an episode. It has left similar reactions as to the other series; it's definitely made me want more & more. I like how its fitting the characters together and all, I feel that there is going to be more & more excitement as this amazing series continues. It's Great; we Like it a lot; we are patiently, as possible, waiting to see what's next for Jimmy; I can only imagine; there will be a lot more excitement. ""It'saul Good"".",2015
6,People will argue that the show is just doing a great job of character development and building drama by filling up two full seasons of back stories and mild plot development. But come on - it's so d*** slow! Something as trivial as Chuck looking for something in his garage takes minutes and minutes of the show. At a point all these drawn-out shots just feel tedious and boring. Some will say it's very realistic in the way it's paced. I'd say too realistic! This is supposed to be entertainment after all!,2016
10,"OK, i appreciate it's hard to judge any new series after just one episode, but with Better Call Saul, we already have the benefit of what went before with Breaking Bad & we can instantly relate to the protagonist. As far as opening episodes go, this ticked all the boxes, it gave us just enough information to make us want to see more, & introduced Saul brilliantly.",2015
5,"If you liked Breaking Bad's ""Fly"" episode, then this show is for you. Otherwise there is very little of Breaking Bad here - almost nothing of the story, the pace, the quality or even the Saul Goodman humor.",2016
1,"This is a perfect example of what happens when creative types indulge in the gem & brilliance hidden deep inside their often padded and overly contrived ideas. No doubt breaking bad was amazing and this wouldn't exist without it. So why the need to make it so terribly slow and obnoxiously in love with its witty dialogue and slow moving Tarantino Esque 20 minute scenes that move the plot along by ZERO. Most of the convenient circumstances in this show are less plausible than one of those silly comic book movies of grown men in spandex fighting 70's Star Trek aliens. Hey egomaniacs making this swill, get the hell on with the plot and stop pussyfooting around in love with your cinematography and witty Easter eggs all on the shoulders of a much more superior show. The performances are the only thing that keep me even trying to give it a chance week after week. It should have been made into a 2 or 3 part series and cut out the garbage. No thank you",2016
7,"This show has very little to do with Breaking Bad, but it's still a spin off. The immense success of Breaking Bad has brought a lot of goodwill and patience to this show.",2016
4,"I've watched every episode. I desperately want things to get moving, but it's the slowest, most boring series I have ever watched. The cast are great. I mean Saul is a great character, as is Mike, and it was breaking bad that got most of us here. But it's averaging 9/10, and I'm left wondering how .... it's quite dull.I'll continue to watch, purely because I'm sure it will get good, but entire episodes pass without incident, I get the feeling it's not that good but people are rating it higher purely because of the character they liked from a better show. But this is 'Joey' to breaking bads 'friends' rather than what Frasier is to cheers.",2016
1,"As an enthusiastic fan of Breaking Bad, I really tried to like this show...but after four episodes, I refuse to watch anymore. It is NOTHING like Breaking Bad, except for the fact that some of the same characters make guest appearances. In my opinion, based on the whole premise of the show, it will never have any of the intensity or suspense of Breaking Bad...this show is just plain AWFUL! For some reason, however, it seems as though everyone is afraid to admit it; face it people, the emperor has no clothes! By the way, why did this show have such a high rating before it even premiered? It says something like: ""voting not allowed until after the release date"", yet it started out with a rating of 9.5...that seems very suspicious to me.",2015
6,After watching the whole first series I have to say I am disappointed about BCS. I really wanted it to be good. ,2015
2,"I just don't get these ""great"" reviews. The show, in my opinion, is mediocre and not at all what I was expecting in a Breaking Bad-related show. This show compared to Breaking Bad is apples and oranges. It's just a dark comedy and I'm not impressed. The story line with the brother who is allergic to electricity or some stupid thing, was really getting old for me, and I have since stopped watching the series. Since Bob Odenkirk is a comedian by background, I guess I should have known what was to come, but I really thought it was going to be more like Breaking Bad. This show is a disappointment for me. I know that I am an outlier here in stating these opinions, but they are just that, my opinions.",2015
2,OMG. This show is slow. 2 seasons watching and nothing happened. NOTHING. Scenes that take forever to finish without being important for the plot. Wait a minute...Did i say plot? What plot? Most boring show EVER...spoiler alert...episode 1 season 3. Mike is eating peanuts waiting for someone to show up. FOREVER.,2017
2,Before I write this review I want everybody reading it I understand that I was one of the biggest Breaking Bad fans just like everybody else. I thought Breaking Bad an absolute Masterpiece of Art and definitely a breakthrough in television originality.,2016
2,Better Call Saul is a massive disappointment to me after all the hype i just cannot for the life of me see what all the fuss is about .The plot is boring slow and obviously dragged out to pad for time..one example of that is during the last show of the season when Saul is calling the bingo and a ball with the letter b before the number comes up continuously..talk about over done..really what was the point of dragging it out like that..and how anyone can possibly compare Better Call Saul with Breaking Bad i have no idea..BCS is not even in the same league as BB. Sure there are moments of good television there but they are few and far between and there is not enough of them to rescue this show from impending mediocrity..sorry..just my opinion,2015
1,"Breaking Bad. ever the best. Saul, ever charming. Nothing is Bad (in a good sense) about this spin-off though. There is no Saul in Better Call Saul and it has run 2 full seasons (2 years and still no idea if anything has changed or what direction it is headed). So dull and dragging, the characters might as well have slept through 2 years. As static as a nail on a nuclear bunker... There is not a single interesting character other than the ones that are originally from Breaking Bad. This is just trying to run on the success of something brilliant as Breaking Bad. It is very much sad and disappointing, there is no way to sugarcoat this. The best part of BB was how pacy the story was in contradiction to the how slow each scene was. There was an intriguing story-line and characters were growing and transitioning and the unpredictability made the show such a popular favorite. BCS does not have any punch at all. Better Call Saul, better not.",2016

5,"The pilot was exciting, tattoo girl and her FBI Handler. ",2016
7,Blindspot focuses on a mysterious tattooed woman who has lost her memory and does not know her own identity. The FBI discovers that each tattoo contains a clue to a crime they will have to solve.,2016
5,Let me summarize this show by this simple formula that every episode follows - mix and match the following for each episode:,2016
3,"I've seen a lot of promos for ""Blindspot"" so I'm assuming that NBC is betting on this new fall TV show being a break-out hit. Sorry, ""Blindspot"" is mediocre at best. It tries way too hard to be something new when it's really just a mash-up of earlier TV shows -- ""Prison Break,"" ""The Blacklist"" -- and a little kick-ass cop show added in. And while there are similarities between this show and ""The Blacklist"" (a female lead who seems too attractive to be believable and a confusing plot that will evolve -- unravel? -- as the season progresses), ""The Blacklist"" has James Spader, who could read off the ingredients in a cereal box and still manage to entertain. Unfortunately, ""Blindspot"" has no such captivating actor or actress. Additionally, the dialogue in ""Blindspot"" really doesn't help. No banter, no personality. Just cliché cop show dribble.",2015
9,"I'd actually give this an 8.5, but decided to round up vs. down to counter balance some of the negative recent reviews submitted by others. I thought Jaimie Alexander was great and demonstrated her talent in this role more than I've seen from her in past roles such as Thor and The Brink. Sullivan Stapleton's acting was admittedly a little wooden in the pilot, but I liked his tough guy persona in Strike Back & think he'll grow into this role with time also. Yes, the story line is completely far-fetched and unrealistic. Yes, the plot does borrow from different formulas we've seen before, but not in a way that's a total rip off from other movies or TV. It doesn't have the originality of Mr Robot or the grittiness of True Detective, but it's fun popcorn entertainment. If you put Bourne Identity, Blacklist and Momento into a blender, you'd end up Blindspot!",2015
6,"Since the days of Michael Scofield from Prison Break it's been a rare occasion that a character has plot line literally tattooed on their body. Blindspot offers a couple of intriguing gimmicks and mysteries with the premise of savant consultant and stern officer, but it tends to be the same investigation cop drama again. Its original hook might not endure its barren plot device, underlying secret or romance subplot.",2015
3,"The basic plot/idea of the series (as far as one can see after the pilot) seems to be interesting and certainly suspenseful but the acting is at best mediocre. Sullivan Stapleton was already not really convincing in 'Strike Back', even as 'reckless cowboy soldier' but Jaimie Alexander's main quality seems only to be good looking. Otherwise she's absolutely not qualified for an action role (female 'Seal', are you kidding me, can't even handle a handgun properly, not to speak about the 'wooden' fighting scenes) like the role she has in this series. Secondly, it's pretty -not to say totally- unlikely the authorities would allow her to be involved (as a 'Jane Doe') in counter-terrorist activities but that fits in the whole weak picture of how the FBI is handling the situation. So, not a convincing start but I won't give up on them just now and will watch another episode. It can only get better ...",2015
2,"I really did try to like this show, I gave it a genuine chance watching the first and almost half of the second episode but I couldn't in good conscience stomach the god awful acting that was being performed. I wanted to watch a few episodes to nail down exactly what was wrong so here are the results.",2015
8,"Giving thought that this is a review on the Pilot, they're many things I should mention. Pilots are typically the best sort of introduction to what it to come, so yes things can seem a bit rushed from time to time. Also not all actors or actresses may seem to have a good grip on their parts and many more things like this play into the mix. In this Pilot for the TV Series ""Blindspot"", they did do a very good job in the presentation.",2015
1,This TV show is really bad.,2015
1,"This has to go down as the most inane and laziest script ever written for TV. There is the story line that as they storm the Statue of Liberty its point out that there is only 3 FBI agents going to comb the island to which JANE gets to go because she speaks Chinese. I mean in all of NYC there is only 3 FBI agents to handle the situation. WTF? What happened to all the FBI agents or NYPD tactical squad? Its just not addressed figuring the viewers will just accept the situation as the writer wrote. Then, the Chinese dissident is left alone in a hospital and the FBI does not have the guy under guard. What if he just walked out? Lame lame lame. And those two examples was just the tip of the iceberg. Worst writing/story structure I have ever seen. These guys should be striped of their WGA membership. I was looking forward to seeing the story arc of the story. However, I'm afraid this inane writing will be in every episode so I'm done. Its going to go off the rails and not goanna waste my time with such poor story structure and writing.",2015
1,"NBC states this is the ""Number 1"" show on network TV today, which just shows you they must be blind themselves. This show is a poorly acted, poorly written clichéd mess. SPOILER ALERT for anyone who hasn't seen the first episode: A duffel bag appears in Times Square; thinking it might be a bomb, the FBI moves in on it, guns drawn, until a naked woman covered in tattoos emerges. Surprise, she has no idea who she is or how she got there. Surprise, she has no idea why she's covered in these tattoos, and surprise, instead of treating her as a trauma victim, they arrest her! Later they determine, based on one of the tattoos, that she's actually a trained Navy SEAL. Right. Because only a SEAL could have that particular mark. I just about turned off the TV right there. One moment she's quivering with fear and panic, the next she's some martial arts expert, but then goes back to being a clueless whiner. But then they give this amnesiac a place on their team- a team led by some guy who has no idea what a razor is, apparently. Sorry NBC, but the FBI does have a dress code, and his unshaven look isn't rugged or hot...he just looks like a slob. As far as the character he's portraying, could he be more one-dimensional?",2016
4,"I want to love this show. I really want to love it. ""Blindspot"" centers around a woman, covered from neck to toes in tattoos, found in a bag in the middle of Times Square. The woman has no memory of who she is, from where she came, or how she came to be covered in tattoos. Her journey to self-rediscovery seems to be the most prominent tattoo: the name ""Kurt Weller"" - an FBI agent - tattooed on the top-middle part of her back, as if to say ""start here"". From there, her tattoos seem to be a road map to various crimes and terror threats that need stopped and busts that need made by the FBI, party of 4 or 5. Trying to figure out who this Jane Doe is puts a nice spin on the cop procedural genre.",2016
3,You know something is out of sort when 30 minutes into the show you feel like an hour has past. It's been my experience that if something doesn't engage the viewer within the first 20 to 30 minutes of a show then the show (for me) is at an end. And here in Blindspot that very thing didn't happen - I could not connect with any element of the story.,2015
1,"The girl in tattoos is interesting to look at but the dragon tattoo girl had better dialog to work with. Some ridiculous things that make this a show I'll never watch again. Rather than go immediately and help a naked victim emerging from a bag, Homeland Security pulls weapons and screams at her to get on the ground (they're not really that cowardly are they?) If the massive amounts of drug are in her system, how does she remember getting out of the bag? Shouldn't she be in a hospital? They've determined 'she knows music but doesn't know the Beatles' - sort of an odd test, how much time did they spend on that one, 'here I'll play some music - do you know that's 'music'? Which of these songs - sorry you don't know what a 'song' is - okay which one is the Beatles?"" ""Try these 2 drinks one is coffee one is tea, tell me which one you like best?"" Don't warn her it might be hot. She slugs them both down - ""That one tastes like grass clippings"" - She knows what grass clippings taste like? Detectives that don't have flashlights in a dark building. New York detectives that don't have a translator going into a building they know from a Chinese script address. The main 'Archer' FBI guy shouts at the Chinese speaking people, ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU!"" Other than the shouting parts, the main 'Archer' FBI guy mumbles all his dialog. Throwing a bomb down a subway tunnel - phew, no problem there, right? Only 3 cops available to search for a bomb on 14 acres around the Statue of Liberty. How do you get to the top of the Statue in 15 seconds? The tattoo girl can't keep her hands off 'Archer' - I think a 15 year old gamer wrote this and his Hollywood daddy green-lit it.",2015
1,I do not understand the level of thinking that went into this. Either it was designed for 12 years or else it was written for a very unassuming audience..,2015

1,"I watch the first episode and not even 7 minutes in and i've already been blindsided by so many flubs and imperfections its a wonder that I wasn't watching a B movie. Then I realized, I was. I was watching a really expensive, multi season B movie and I was at peace. This show has some alright action scenes but, like every review of this you see on this website, suffers from bad writing, Bad acting, and is just a good concept done in a tired manner.",2016
6,"I just watched the first episode and find that its a start of another typical actions series based on an unknown plot. As usual the main role doesn't know what she is? Audience will find a clue at the end of the first season as a base for the next. Are you guys not bored to these kinds of series? They might have put more money than others for action scenes. For the writer's comfort they added a memory loss. So main role will survive any kind of catastrophe. You can see it in the black list, The Mentalist and more number of series. Only difference is the action content and more technology use. Don't you think people deserve more than a good plot?",2015
2,"Blindspot is a rather unremarkable espionage, thriller. ",2015
5,"Well the series seems to be having a good plot ,, the story started a bit loose but they picked it up right in the middle. There are a lot of questions to be asked ,, the script is moving a little slow, not compromising the whole surprising factor . The idea of the show is fresh though not that genuine talking about a character remembers nothing and act like a valuable source to help the FBI solve many crimes,, and from the first look, the pilot was organized and had a couple of excitement moments but still not strong enough to make an NBC Drama Summer Hit.",2015
7,"Okay, let face it. The first season was plain coupled with bad acting. It starts with a pretty much interesting story line and the first few minutes capture your attention. Curiosity out of the bag. So you sit there waiting for ""shit"" to unravel. I mean all those tattoos right. But then you find yourself struggling to ""enjoy"". However, they did manage to turn it around. Season 2 was much better and I have to admit I really enjoyed watching it. So maybe I rated this a 7/10 solely based on the second season but maybe its also because the dots start connecting more clearly. Plus Archie joins the team. I love her. But I still maintain that its the second season that steals the show because the first was definitely not good.",2016
1,"***The Review May Contain Spoilers, if the Script hasn't spoiled it enough for you**** The show's only good part is the very beginning that only showed the girl found in a bag. I wondered why more wasn't shown, and now I see why.",2015
10,"Wow, I started watching first episode and was skeptical. Those type of shows about hackers and conspiracy are not my favorite. But I loved the first episode, it is well done, acting is amazing however it seems to be going too fast. It seems they have too many ideas and only show us a little bit. The first episode had just over an hour, yet so much happened in it that it could easily be split into 2-3 episodes. But at least it is not boring. It also seems real. And they use command tool for hacking, not one of those super spy CIA graphical interface that you just have to press ""HACK"" and you are hacker .. oh how I hate those. I am not saying this is the way hacking works, but it does seem closer to the real thing more than dumb Hollywood movies. I watch many TV shows and this one really got my attention. Highly recommended.",2015
10,"The pilot episode of this series shows great promise. At the risk of failing to appeal to the modern television viewer who has become accustomed to shows lacking true substance, it will most certainly captivate a core audience of viewers who feel alienated by the typical programming of the modern day. The narrative touches on topics like social and digital revolution through the thoughts of the protagonist as he narrates the episode. The status quo of modern social behavior, consumerism, and corporate greed prevailing by virtue of the complacency amongst the proletariat is a core issue that both the show and protagonist address with great disdain. It ironically begs the question that if our complacency with the quality of consumer items––such as substandard television programming––is so entrenched in our society, when we are finally greeted with an oasis of the kind of talented artistic expression that this show offers devoid of being dumbed-down or hollowed out in effort to appeal to a wider audience, will we be able to transcend our usual tastes, or will the level of real, thought-provoking narratives lead a disinterest among the typical armchair audience and eventually the show's demise? ",2015
8,"Going in with low expectation, not knowing anything about this show, the pilot turned out to offer a pleasant surprise. In short, the show is a bit unconventional, like a mix between an audio book and a TV show, but one rather well researched and executed.",2015
10,"Did USA really just do this? They have managed to give me a combination of the best parts of Swordfish AND Fight Club and managed to make it coherent, suspenseful and a joy to watch. And Christian Slater gives yet another go at TV-Land and may have finally hit the mark!",2015
1,The first few episodes are great. They seem realistic and plausible. Something that could happen at your local city centre.,2016
9,"Though Christian Slater's previous tech-geared TV drama flopped without notice, this new effort has just enough grit to keep people interested. The main character, not Christian Slater, could be one reason for a positive shift. Elliot, played by Rami Malik, pulls off the beady eyed grayhat fairly well, and riffs of ""Fight Club"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Hackers"" all coexist to compose a decent melody of scenes. For me, it appealed to the cyberpunk bookworm and anime watcher of old who spent decades in a barely fed genre.",2015
8,"I wanted to write a 2 sentence review; 'Bravo! More please...' However IMDb doesn't allow for that and neither does it let me place the spacing as I would like, between my lines of commentary and review, which is rather frustrating IMDb.",2015
4,"Season 1 got me so hung up. The season was brilliant, original with great character and original story development. The themes treated were new and never seen on a general public TV series. Also it uncovers a world of hacking with great accuracy and inspiration. Elliot's story was completely unexpected and all the side stories were intriguing. ",2016
2,"I hung in there hoping Season 1 would become a truly gripping and insightful story about technology and it's big brother presence in our daily lives and how dangerous that is for both the public at large and the corporate structures that are so reliant on it. No dice. I watched the entire Season 1 episodes back-to-back and was flabbergasted at the shallowness of this series. First off, Malek's wooden performance is a dead giveaway early on to one of the weak surprise reveals. Second, the sub plots of the ghetto drug culture and homosexuality were blatantly obvious fillers to widen the demographic net, probably foisted on the writers by the network execs. None of it added to the story. The insidious perversity in this story really lies with the executive management goals of E Corp and that was barely examined as an encompassing and destructive aspect of current society. While we heard some very articulate - great writing here! - complaints with the inner monologues of the lead, not much time was devoted to the real impact of monopolies and their greed, data breaches, and the human disconnect that has electronic chatter replacing social engagement. Lastly, I'm not a techie so I can't comment on the technical accuracy, but I'm doubtful that the crash could have happened as shown here. If it's this easy to get into high security buildings, break through firewalls, enlist the Chinese, etc., etc., then we are ALL - not just corporations - in big trouble and this was not addressed at all. That's where the real story & suspense would be. My 2 stars are for the ""attempt"" at something meaningful, even though it failed. I don't understand all the high ratings - is it spoofing?",2016
9,"This is a show worthwhile watching. A series about hacking, but not the usual whiz kids. That helps a lot. The first period was already an eye opener and the characters are as real as they can get. The protagonist has personality problems, which makes him the more acceptable. He knows his way computer systems and is able to dig up all kind of information on others. And how is does is very believable.",2015

This is no tale of robin hood he and the main characters are a reflection of our debauchery and self obsession of the disempowered and alone, they are no different than the so called evilcorp they battle against. I hope this doesn't go any further as a series as it deepens the well of our suffering. We all want to kick it against the man but this series makes us as bad as them for right or for wrong.I can hardly tell a word he says and the only relief in all this emptiness is angela. I will watch one more episode to see what happens next and then stop. The worst series since Caprica.",2016
1,"How very disappointing... Boring, slow, uninspired. There's nothing left from the promising season 1. I believe I read somewhere online that after season 1's success the director was given full freedom on shooting season 2. The result shows he is incapable to perform without having someone to control and micromanage him. There's no story telling any more and the characters turned blunt.Script and direction is of primary school graduates. This is now an overestimated TV series, which will be easily forgotten. It should have stopped being produced, at least there would be a sweet memory left of a promising TV series. Not going to waste my time watching it any more and as another reviewer mentioned previously ""I am jumping off this train"" too.",2016
5,"I say it has no plot because the story hasn't progressed. I mean, from the beginning, to the season finale, the timeline of the story's progression is simply dull. I give this 5 stars out of 10 because of the potential it had but the story itself crumpled and just fell apart. ",2015
1,"For some reason Media has always had it for science and technology, regardless the fact that they rely on it on every stupid thing they produce, just like the rest of the religious community take on the same subjects.

1,"The creator seems to have ripped off huge chunks of ideas from the plots of The Matrix and Fight Club (with the Marxist BS cranked up to 11), smushed them together, and populated the world with nothing but cardboard characters and scene after scene of clichés.",2015
9,"The series has a very interesting premise. By far it has the closest technical reality when it comes to hacking .(i am talking about the bullshit they show in movies probably using hackertyper). Very nice portrayal of solving computer problems in real world. The lead character has done a really good job convincing the viewer of his mental state. The writing was decent.The cameo from Christian Slater was very good. When he talked about software running the world, virtual money and moving away from gold standard which are absolutely true. Overall the subject is really tough to deal with and the director/writer did a wonderful job in giving the audience a clear picture. One hour pilot was spectacular and I hope it will progress into a more engaging TV show. I am confident of USA network since they have been giving excellent TV.",2015
3,"I, like many others, thought the pilot was phenomenal. It showed a computer security software tech, Elliot, who wanted to make a revolutionary change in the world using hactivision and to take down an ""evil"" corporate empire. I was looking forward to a new fantastic show about how computers and technology —and the people in the field/hobby, can make a huge impact in the world.",2015
2,"I reviewed the pilot episode and gave it a high ranking. I looked forward to the next episode ... it was so-so. Waited for the next ... oh dear, what a dysfunctional mess. The main character, who 'seemed' so interesting in the pilot, has degenerated into little more than a shallow child and the other characters in the show are little more than window dressing and as undeveloped as the main character. A show with great potential sadly wasted on a clichéd hum-drum who cares anyway story. I am left wondering why, when there are so many interesting and stimulating places to which scriptwriters can take an audience, they choose depressing life-scenarios and self-obsessed pseudo-intellectual ghetto types as their subject of choice. Pointless and boring. Rated at 2 and I'm being kind.",2015

1,"Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, cliché movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great? ",2016
4,"I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of ""Big bang theory"" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of ""WTF"" or ""Seriously?"" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!",2015
6,I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed.,2015
2,I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly disappointed when I finally watched it.,2015
3,"Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects.",2016

1,"I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekend and I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had to offer. So just how bad was ""The Martian?"" So bad that after an hour I realized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat than sitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog (lines like ""F**k you Mars!"" and ""I'm going to science the S**T out of it!"") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into the space program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.) Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one of those guys on ""The Big Bang Theory?"" Snarky and idiotic and always cracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ what he's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was with all the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far as I'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a video camera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone who would potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, things like: ""Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist."" It's clear he was attempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginary audience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing there is. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowling balls of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you've already figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant that there was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instruction manual for a microwave oven. ""How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there's some poo."" (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was as slack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, false falseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first hour or so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feel my brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self- preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't get me started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musical taste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.) If there is a more unoriginal, un-involving, unbelievable waste of time out there, I haven't seen it. So of course: Line up the Oscars!",2015
4,"Underwhelming and boring movie, can't understand how it gets so much acclaim and good reviews in general. The theme of man overcoming challenges through ""science"" sprinkled with disco music here and there to awaken viewers along the way and raise their spirits felt cliché and didn't make it for me. The film just felt somewhat void and foreseeable. I think it lacked suspense and if I may ""planetary or space awesomeness"", but of course that is not the mood the film aims at, so you can blame me for judging it from my expectations rather than than considering the movie in itself. However, to me it seems almost like a movie about Mars had to be made and this is what we got.",2016
1,"This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.",2015

My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course.",2015

1,"Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: ""Gravity"" had me on the edge of the seat and ""Interstellar"" had me hold my breath. Not to mention ""Moon"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Odyssee"". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it.",2015
2,"This movie is so science-y. You will just love how much it quotes science. Like, you know, real science. And that is why I loved this movie.

It's like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye had a love child. And Carl Sagan.",2015

1,"The Terminator franchise started with a low-budget thriller film that introduced a very interesting and compelling story about a woman who is a target of a ruthless man from the future that turns up to be a cyborg. It was a simple yet good story and a good piece of science fiction. Why was it a good film? Well, for starters, the bad guy, i.e the terminator, according to Kyle Reese, doesn't feel pain or pity, can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with. It was the perfect killer, and almost invincible. So there you got all the elements of a good story.",2015
5,The Terminator movies (sans TS - I am not even sure if it's part of the cannon) are basically chase films with the element of time travel thrown in to create unique Sci-fi protagonists and antagonists.,2015

Not even close and it never will be. If this is a 7.0 then Salvation is a 14.0/10. James Cameron should be ashamed for even entertaining the idea that this movie is good. He has made me realize that everyone can be bought for the right amount. I hope he got paid a lot of money to say ""If you are a terminator fan, you will love this movie"", because he has lost a lot of respect with that statement. Hope it was worth it James!",2015

7,"The story starts a bit confusing, but after a short time it's back to business. It's a great addition to the series and it's nice to see Arnold back in this role. The special effects are not always the best, but most parts look great. The new type terminator is great, but the old T800 is still not obsolete. The story is convincing enough and can be the prelude of new additions to this series. I hope Arnold will be part of these. It's a pity 3D is still the norm in most cinemas. This movie is best viewed in normal 2D. It's dark en there are no special benefits in 3D. The movie gives also a good critical note about our dependency of our smart-phones, tablets and the Internet integration. Genisys might be more true that we realize ;)",2015
1,"Against all odds I was amazed I made it to the end of this movie. I only wish I could go back in time and tell my wife to talk me out of the suggestion I made to see Terminator Genisys. The original Terminator movie is a cult classic and yes, the remade scenes entertained me on a nostalgia level but as for the rest of the script, it played out like an episode of neighbours. The acting was terrible, the casting was terrible, the action sequences...If I said, give me $170 million dollars for me to take a dump and then I'll feed it to the masses and make a profit, you'd think I was insane - yet Hollywood does it again. Another 3 dimensional turd (yes I sadly paid the extra for the 3D which only really amounted to feeling like someone was actually shi**ing in my face) served up for the intellectually bereft to eat popcorn too. I don't know where these great reviews are coming from, but they're certainly not from Ireland, because in my cinema there was a general feeling of agitation and boredom about an hour into the movie.

10,"I really loved the way they seamlessly tied this in with the first two movies. The visuals were outstanding! The old T100 looked exactly as the original! Arnold's portrayal of this T800 was wonderful. The interactions between he and Sarah made for a great emotional basis for their relationship. I loved Michael Biehn's portrayal of Kyle Reese in the first film and was afraid of being disappointed in Jai Courtney's reprisal of the role (though I am a fan of him as well) but was pleasantly surprised by it. I did think it was a bit of a slip up when they failed to explain how the T1000 was able to time travel back to 1984 since he is not metal encased in living flesh but it was too minor of a mistake to bother me much. I look forward to the next installment, especially if this is any indication of the direction they are going.",2015
1,"There is really nothing to say about this film besides that it's a complete slap in the face to anyone who is a fan of the Terminator franchise.

However, in 2008, it was released the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" that also worked well showing how Sarah and John Connor survived along the years.

Arnold was Arnold and genuinely looked like he was having fun with the role. The story to me was pretty well written and despite lots of turns along the way, was engaging. There was plenty of comic relief. The battle scenes play homage to the aesthetic and look of the future wars in the 1st two movies.",2015

Terminator 5 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are no words to describe how awful this is. They couldn't have made it any worse even if they tried. Everything from the acting to the script to the special effects is absolutely laughable. And yes I did start laughing at some point, thinking 'what the hell is going on here?'. The people who wrote the script should be fired, the actors should go to acting classes and Arnie should apologise to the fans for this monstrosity. This should have never been made.

9,"I yield to no one in my affection for the Terminator movies. From the very first little movie to the latest I have enjoyed each in different ways for different reasons. None is a failure. From what I had heard and read this newest (and I hope not the last!) instalment was inferior, not respectful of its predecessors, poorly thought out and, as one reviewer wrote, makes a hash of all that went before. Fortunately for me I had seen the old double VCR version of T2 with an alternate ending, i.e., the destruction of San Francisco. Imagine my joy to see it in this movie. Terminator Genisys is reverential - there are so many scenes from the first movie it is almost plagiarism. The tricky business of time is dealt with most satisfactorily. The most shocking reversal of earlier matters was jarring but OK. Emilia Clarke was superb as this Sarah Conner. How fortunate we have been with all three actors Linda Hamilton, Lena Heady (on television) and Clarke! The male leads were very good, particularly the John Conner character with J.K Simmons giving another wonderful performance. I found the whole movie very satisfying and I hope that we will yet again hear the words, ""I'll be bahck.""",2015

The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard.

In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON.

4,"I'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.",2015
1,"Never watch this movie it is an insult to the superhero movie category. Their is simply nothing good about this movie the scene were they are drinking and chilling was OK but 99% of the film was cringy and simply bad it ignored all sense of relationships or personal lives the characters may have and pited them against a hastily put together villain with the personality of a child who often had looney tunes references and scenes, for example near the end Ultron is about to be hit by the hulk and the whole world pauses while he has some cringy unfunny one liner along the lines of ""hey how about we call it a truce"" then he is punched away into the distance as the world starts back up again it felt like the director had fallen asleep watching a wille e coyote cartoon the night before filming this scene.",2016
10,"Yes, the Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. This is exactly the sequel to a great film that we have been dreaming about. It's superb on every single level. It honestly has no real flaws that I could see. How great does a movie have to be given the inherent difficulties in making a film like this in the first place? Writer/director Joss Whedon did an admirable job of balancing the screen time of the sprawling and expanding cast.",2015
1,"There's no one word that can some up this movie. I won't use 'eh' because that's a bit too vague, and I think it's a bit better than that. But things like 'good' or 'amazing' are too crazy to use. Welcome to my review.",2015

1,"This movie was a failure on many levels. There was a serious lack of story, the humor was very forced in an overabundance of one-liners, bad CGI in some places, and a very under-developed Villain. The movie focused a lot on the characters in the movie and developing them, but not even that much. We get a few tidbits about each, except Thor, Stark/Ironman, and Hulk/Banner. Thor was hardly in the movie, only shown on screen for a few minutes after leaving the team to basically setup the next movie and where the story is going (Infinity War), but is glossed over so quickly most people won't catch it, especially those who have no idea about story arcs in the comics. Ultron's reveal was absolutely perfect, it set him up as an intimidating and powerful villain, then when he gets his own mechanical body, he turns into a comedy act and does not look real because the CGI metal looks terrible, along with the stupid moving mouth when he speaks.",2015
10,"Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. ",2015
1,"Well, the superhero movies have sucked their last dollar out of me. I don't like watching movies just to see things blown up. The writers and director are so much into showing off their destructive action sequences that they didn't pause to consider whether soneone would actually give an F. Superthin plot. The occasional quip grom Ultron or an Avenger gets old quick with nothing else to support it. We're clearly dealing with high school humor here. I really like the scene where the earth is caving in, thousands of people obviously meeting gruesome deaths, and yet a few Avengers take the time to save one woman in a falling vehicle...NOT.",2015
4,"This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.",2016
9,"Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better—if not as well as the previous release—it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.",2015

I am a Marvel fan that also like DC movies and series, but in my opinion I think DC makes good TV series on small screens however I think Marvel makes great movies on big screens. The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the best superhero film in my opinion because of the huge surprises in the movie and the incredibly thrilling storyline from the comics, the directors of the movie did change the storyline a bit though, it's not like a copy and paste storyline from the comic book. Therefore, this is the best superhero film of all time in my opinion.",2015
6,"I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past: that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.",2016

10,"I cannot believe all the negative reviews this show has gotten! It is well written and absolutely hilarious. The entire cast is superb, somehow James Brolin just keeps getting better with age! The show follows one family, parents their three grown children and their families. Every character on the show is interesting. Even the young kids are well written. They are wealthy and somehow it is still easy to relate to them. It is witty, sarcastic, and much funnier than most of the shows it is compared to, though I don't see why it's compared to anything, as it is very original. It is one of the few comedies my husband and I both agree on, laugh out loud funny! Give this show a chance, I don't see how you could be disappointed.",2016
10,"Wish I would have caught on from the beginning, but I will watch all episodes. This is an extremely witty and tightly written show. Very funny. The writing and acting work perfectly together. The cast is a wonderful blend of seasoned and lesser-known actors and they are all terrific. I really hope that the show's popularity has staying-power, but that may depend on the intelligence of the audience. Even the kids in the cast are wonderful. I've looked up the cast members whom I didn't know within IMDb so that I could get to know them a little better. Keep up the good work. I really appreciate what you're doing. I have been recommending to others.",2016
10,"Nothing but respect and total love for this show... the entire cast is funny (Jordan, Colin, Zoe,etc.) and the writing is awesome! I love comedy shows that actually make me laugh out loud, and I was pleasantly surprised that each episode made me laugh several times. Other shows try too hard or not enough...other shows have a great cast but bad writers...this one has everything right (much like Goldilock's third pick in the house she trespassed in)...I also appreciate the fact that each episode is broken down into four yummy bite sized servings.. this fresh format helps with the flow of the show's comedic pace... Hope this show gets more love from viewers and critics",2015
10,"I really enjoyed the pilot but am enjoying this show even more as it progresses. I haven't watched a ""laugh-out-loud"" sitcom for awhile until this show - last week I almost doubled over during some of the segments. The entire cast is brilliant and pulls it off every week. I never knew Colin Hanks could be that funny! And I'm so happy to see Zoe Lister-Jones (who I loved in Whitney) and Thomas Sadosky (wonderful in Newsroom). Dan Bakkedahl is absolutely brilliant as are Dianne Weist and James Brolin. Even the kids are good, and I'm usually not enamored of child actors. ",2015

The kids are just perfect; the couples all fit so Great together in their comedy. I look forward to this next episode every week. I was a breaking bad addict so seeing Betsey Brandt in anything is a plus for me. James Brolin doesn't age and is hilarious. Everyone of these actors/actresses are considered people I'd watch in anything they are in; just because of ""Life in Pieces"". Keep it up guys Great Comedy sitcom.",2015

With ""Parenthood"" off the air and other family dramas overly dramatic ""Empire,"" ""Life in Pieces"" features catchy dialogue that isn't sappy, relatable family situations, and a cast of lovable characters (including the fab Dianne Wiest, easy going James Brolin, and funny men Dan Bakkedahl and Colin Hanks to name just a few of the great cast). This new series is a reminder that good TV doesn't need to be filled with drama at every turn. ""Life in Pieces"" is sure to be one of this seasons good family TV viewing experiences.",2015
8,"I've only seen the first episode so far, but it was very funny. The setup is a little strange, so there are all these different stories and you don't know how they connect until the end, but that will probably make more sense now that they've established the premise. ",2015
9,"This show is easily one of the best of the few worth watching on television. I found this on Netflix, and started watching the show afterwards. Great writing, acting. funny, witty, amusing...If you haven't watched this yet, go do it now!!! Don't wait!! Go!!! I had given up on television completely, and then found this",2017
9,"Finally a show on network TV that pushes the limits. Story lines have contemporary issues with enough characters to keep it interesting. Format is unique and keeps you wanting more. It has some adult only content, so I would not recommend for anyone under the age of 17. Also has lots of good and recognizable actors. Colin Hanks, Dianne Weist, James Brolin and Thomas Sadoski (from the Newsroom), all seasoned actors. Probably best for the 40-plus audience. I will definitely keep watching. I gave it 9/10 stars. ",2015
9,I'm a hard person please when it comes to comedy but Life in Pieces has me laughing out loud. The cast is perfect...the writing is brilliant. Haven't seen James Brolin in anything for quite a while & never knew he was a natural comic. Colin Hanks is just as versatile in his comedic talent. I don't it would do him justice to compare him to his Academy award winning father but to say that he has inherited his father's talent is an understatement. This ensemble of brilliant performers gets it right. Guest appearances only add to the enjoyment. The subject matters that are dealt with hold so true to life & that makes it even more enjoyable. So glad I stumbled on this TV show...especially since I've been hit by a horrible flu & this has definitely lifted my spirits.,2017
9,"We have been watching on Netflix, and my wife now terms this her favorite show. Very imaginative, 4 different mini episodes per episode. She was devastated to see there was only 1 season, until we found on IMDb the second season still being produced. Hopefully Netflix will pick the second season up as well.",2017

9,I am a grown man who has no kids of my own but I love this show and so do my teen siblings who are not usually amused by network comedy.with the exception of the middle and Goldberg's but we don't like modern family very much however this is a very nice treat for us we all find it hilarious every week we get at least one laugh at the show I love Sam and Sophi the grandpa is funny too and the son in law is funny so if u are like us and don't really like modern family give this a shot you might find it entertaining I know I love it and have been able to really relate to the family and feel like I can kinda understand my own family better after watching,2017
10,"Spotted this show on Amazon Prime about a month back but did not download the first series until a week ago - now all episodes are watched and I am feeling slightly bereft! This show is fantastic - cannot find fault in either the writing or acting. The humour is fast-paced and clever, and reminds me at times of Brooklyn Nine-Nine (with a pinch of The Goldbergs). The only thing that slightly lets the show down for me is the cocky know-it-all youngest granddaughter but it is about a typical American family (wherein you would expect to see the odd young child kicking about). Each episode contains four stories and whilst these can contain some very separate tales that are never touched on again in the series, there are other moments that are continued throughout the series thus enabling you to really get to know the characters.",2016
7,"If I was to review this show after the first episode or even the second, I would have given it a 4 or 5 at best. However, I've always had a rule for new series. I give it four shows. If I don't care if I watch the 5th episode, then I delete it from the DVR. Well, this show is getting better each week. I really like the actors on the show so that has helped. However, the concept didn't take ""flight"" with me until last week. It was exceptionally funny and did tie in together in that EVERYONE has this family. They are finding their humor and their footing. I'll keep watching. The parents fell flat at first but now, they've taken on the persona that many of us have for parents. They are from a different generation and now, with their grandchildren, they are reliving their youth. To the chagrin of their own children. The children, all leading different stages of their lives, are hilarious. I'm giving this a 7 now because they still haven't brought out the full potential of their family dynamic and the humor that can be found. However, they are on the right track and honestly, it's possible this show will still find its mark while never becoming a full on comedy. I'm fine with that.",2015
10,"Very much in the same comedy vein as Modern Family, this show is very well cast indeed, all round, even the kids are promising characters with comedic potential.",2015
3,"It's Modern Family meets Parenthood, but not as funny. (As Parenthood I mean). It tries tries desperately and fails to replicate the dynamic of Modern Family, while using the family formula from Parenthood. With the lost child who lives with mom and dad, the Claire and Phil clones with a growing family and the rest of the extended family. I just don't know how many ways I can say it was a disappointment. Brolin has never been a favorite, he makes a much better bad guy then he does a comedian. The remainder of the cast is ultimately forgettable as well, the mother is cliché and dull, the kids were given nothing to work with by the writers or the director. The story line of the first episode was boring. The writers broke it into four stories that all suffer from lack of originality, and humor. I would be shocked if this series makes it past the first few episodes.",2015
3,"It's more of the same, as in we've seen it a hundred times before in various forms. Unoriginal & annoyingly so. How does this stuff get commissioned? I realise Hollywood is a grossly nepotistic community but come on! There's not much more to say except that a good cast is let down by jaded ideas & formulaic writing.",2015
6,"I love shows that don't follow tried and true (and tired) formats. And I love shows driven by character development. Life in Pieces has both in spades. Each episode is comprised of four ""short stories"" - and these stories (or vignettes) stack upon each other to build a rich world with funny, nuanced characters...and after a few episodes this world really starts to take form. It's not the typical format where everything is tied together in a pretty bow at the end. Each short story lives and breathes its own life. ",2015
1,"Regrettably ""Life in Pieces"" is burdened by really bad writing. This attempted rip-off of Modern Family has none of it's charm, humor, or truth. Every line of dialog rang false. The situations were silly, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the actions and reactions of the characters were absurd without being funny. I wanted to like this show and had high hopes given some excellent cast members, but this is the worst pilot I've seen in a long time. It's possible that after the usual problems with pilots (i.e the need to introduce the various characters and story lines) are taken care of the show will improve, but it's hard to imagine that it could ever elevate itself to adequacy. I suggest that possible viewers avoid wasting their time by suffering through even a half hour viewing.",2015
8,"Not much for regular TV sitcoms. Tend more toward ""Arrested Development"", ""Always Sunny"", etc. But I ran across an episode of ""Life"" tonight and was impressed and amused. Found this to be a cut above most sitcoms with witty/creative writing and a good ensemble cast to pull it off. Different and very funny. Brolin is a little weak but the rest of the cast excels. Breaking the half hour up into short stories makes for less 'padding' with lame moments and seems to work for this program. The original short in this episode concerning the young son's first girlfriend was hilarious and a good introduction to the whole cast. The cell phone short was timely but a little too cutesy.",2015
1,"This show is not suitable for family viewing...there are far too many sexual situations on the show...sometimes it gets rather explicit and has no place being on so early in the evening when kids are still up. Beside the sexual situations, the other events are rather implausible and seem to be made up just to advance a joke the writers think is funny. It might seem funny in theory about a man who holds a funeral for himself while he's still alive so he can attend it, but in reality, it would be stupid and no one would attend. Having sex in a hotel's ice machine room is quite risky for anyone but somehow this show thinks a middle age couple with kids would actually attempt to do it there. Overall the show was a big thud!",2015
8,Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.,2016
7,"The new cinema year has got off to a robust start with the new movie from Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"", ""Les Misérables""). ",2016
8,"Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I don't consider this a must see.",2016
5,"The story could have been very dramatic and deeply touching, as it is a true story of both the internal conflicts of a man and the deep love of a woman to her partner. Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un- engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I couldn't stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too superficial.",2015
9,"This film melted me like the touch of silk. Although I wasn't fully convinced of the transformation of Einar Wegener, I am deeply touched by the Eddie Redmayne's fragile beauty as a women(or should I say Lily). He comprehends Einar's psychological conditions perfectly, and every twist of his facial muscles or movements of his eyes demonstrate the perfect empathy he has for his role. I don't care about logical consistency of plots or the point of view as long as he is the center of images, he flawlessly convinces me that Einar sincerely believe that he is born to be a woman. And as long as his feelings are as burning and heart-felt as reflected in my eyes, there's nothing to criticize about whether his decisions are morally right or wrong.",2015
7,"Tom Hooper's 'The Danish Girl' is a brave story, about brave people, in a time where their bravery must've been counted as mental illness. Hooper chooses the correct actors to portray the parts & directs the film with dignity. However, The Writing doesn't always engage & is flawed in places.",2015
5,"Set in Copenhagen in the mid-1920s, this film tells the story of the first person to undergo gender reassignment surgery, a story which does not, sadly, have a happy ending. Einar Wegener, a Danish painter, has been married to a fellow-artist, Gerda for six years. Gradually he becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming a woman, a quest which leads him to submit to untried medical procedures which eventually prove fatal.",2016
6,"""He's comfortable in his own skin,"" is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. ""The Danish Girl"" (R, 2:00) is one such story.",2015
8,I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true story makes the whole movie even more involving.,2015
9,"The Danish Girl is a movie loosely based on the life of Danish artists, Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe(Eddie Redmayne) & Gerda Wegener(Alicia Vikander). Einar & Gerda are a happily married couple. Einar is the more accomplished artist, between the two of them. Gerda paints portraits & Einar paints landscapes. Gerda is frustrated because her portraits don't get sold, quite as often as she would like them to. One day, she makes Einar dress up like a woman. Gerda does this because, she wants to paint a portrait of Einar as a woman. Gerda & Einar come up with the name Lili Elbe, for Einar's alter ego. Gerda's Lili portraits are a huge success. What Gerda did not expect is, Einar feels extremely drawn to Lili & sinks more & more into Lili's personality as the days go by. ",2016
3,"I wanted to write a review of this movie, slamming its pretentiousness and hurling tons of allegory onto its maximum levels of Oscar-Bait that the trailer for this movie strained really hard to get across with all of its criteria: the contemporary message of love for the trans community, the good actors, the period-drama setting, the operatic score. Instead, however, I come to tell of a movie that is so emotionally lacking, so frustratingly distant, and so boring, which is in a way the biggest disappointment for me.",2016
5,"""The Danish Girl"" is a beautiful package that came with plenty of anticipation.

3,"First the good: Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance in a poorly written role. The music, when it's not loudly substituting for a decent script, is often lovely. And the historical context is illuminating, especially the very real danger of institutionalization. Other than that, what a mass of prestige picture clichés, laughably symmetrical camera set-ups and gorgeous landscape cinematography. And poor Eddie Redmayne. Completely out of his depth in the central role. Obviously, no one knows how well Lili Elbe passed for a woman, but no one, and I mean absolutely no one, would mistake Redmayne's Lili for anything else but an awkward, clumsy male in a bad wig. Granted, that would make an interesting take on this story: someone who believes they look like a woman but who doesn't. But that's not what this film proposes. Quite the opposite, which is why the audience consistently laughed every time the film suggested that Elbe herself, or other characters believed in the success of the transformation. The script is so cliché ridden and repetitious that even an actor as fine as Matthias Schoenaerts can't liven it up. And for some reason he is made up to look like a sweaty cadaver. And again,I felt bad for Mr. Redmayne, that he didn't get the directorial help he needed in the role and a better script that left him more to say than the trite and predictable lines in this one.",2015

Here is the true story of Einar Wegener, the celebrated Danish artist who became the first recorded case of sex reassignment surgery in history coming out right as publicity about Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner, and the critically acclaimed show ""Transparent"" are pushing all those worn out water cooler jokes right into the trash cans of history. The movie is a loving tribute not only to Wegener's courage in trying to find his own sexual identity during a time when such a thing could easily lead to mental institution, but also to the love and devotion of his wife Gerta who stood by him during his journey of self discovery.",2015
1,"While I don't find the topic of the movie (transgendered individuals) to be totally repulsive, I must admit that the whole hoopla surrounding the release was totally unwarranted. In fact, I believe that this is simple a rewarmed effort which has been previously covered. Specifically, this is simple a boring retelling of the prose which was at the core of another of Redmaynes works - The Theory of Everything. In fact, the most daring portion of the entire film was the sheer plagiarism surrounding the storyline. Of course, if you haven't ever seen the prior works, you might be enticed to think that this was an original work. But even if this were so, how can you justify the gratuitous nature of the flick? I mean using ionizing radiation to immaculate a man? How is that either necessary or realistic?",2016
1,"Went in with high expectations and ended up almost dozing at the slow pace of this movie. Few highlights and drab backgrounds will not attract me to visit Copenhagen. Typical Oscar type movie, well acted by Redmayne and Vikander just a too slow movie pace. Redmaynes character didn't develop for me at all and I couldn't see it improving if I'd stayed longer so 65 mins into it I followed several others who had left early and noticed one guy fast asleep. The core subject as stated in the trailers and posters is Redmayne's exploration of the femininity side of humanity. All well and good in a psychiatrists consultation but for a movie no. Had this been made for TV it could better be serialised. This is just my opinion but I was bored by it however most folk will watch it and rate it for it's acting merit - I rate for watchability.",2016
1,"Boring, boring, boring. If the only thing you want to see is Eddie Redmayne repeatedly dressing up in women's clothes, and portraying him/her in a a single repetitive way (that means putting a wig and a dress on Eddie, and when another character looks at him, cut to a close-up, have him look down with his eyes closed, open them, look up at them with his head still down, slightly cocked to the side, then have him sheepishly smile then this flick's for you. Gosh, that must have been done like 40 times, and they nominated him for an academy award for that). Otherwise, the characters are shallow, and there is no attempt to get to understand his desire to become a woman other than a superficial, quickly told set of occurrences and examples.

1,"A non-biographical biopic, ""The Danish Girl"" is one of the worst attempts at mainstreaming an LGBT-themed story I have ever had the displeasure to see. It takes far too many liberties with the real lives of its principal characters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and reduces an interesting story and relationship to a superficial tear-jerker, albeit an excellently photographed one.",2016

On top of that being a recent release it'll be fresh when peoples minds when they cast their votes .

4,"I like to think I'm as open minded as I can be. Perhaps if I was in a room with a bunch of transgender people they might not see me that way, but I think if I was in a room with a bunch of raving Republicans I would be seen as pretty darn liberal. I think I can defend my open mindedness simply due to the fact that I sat down and eagerly watched The Danish Girl with, well, an open mind. So it pains me to say that watching The Danish Girl I found myself at times laughing when it was not appropriate and also just wanting to gag when it was certainly not intended by the filmmakers. This film is about a guy who, after dressing up like a woman to appease his artist wife who needed a female model, finds himself addicted to dressing up in women's clothing, then succumbs to what can only be described as a schizophrenic bout of split personality during which he thinks he is a woman, resulting in several failed attempts to lock him up in an insane asylum before he finally comes across a surgeon who offers to quite literally cut his penis off and build him a makeshift vagina. This is not such a strange tale actually if it were happening today, I guess, but this tale is happening at the turn of the century (19th to 20th Century that is) and our supposed ""transgender hero"" {{SPOILER ALERT}} DIES as a result of the surgery!!!!",2015
3,I saw the film and thought that the director Tom Hooper(The King's Speech) did not understand the character of Lili. In the beginning we see Einar(Eddie Redmane) as a happy and successful painter living with his wife and we have no idea that he is a transgender. I found that out when his wife puts make up on him and he puts on women's clothes. Thats where the problem started for me. People who are transgender or gay/lesbian donot become transgender if someone else puts lipstick on their lips or get them to wear female clothing. They are human beings going through the identity issues since childhood. They live a very depressed life and they are little different than normal people. I wish the director had done some homework and met some of these people to know what they went through. Neither did the actor Eddie Redmane made the effort to meet some transgender people and do some research. Actors get the script and they just jump into playing a role without doing homework.,2015

This movie is about unconditional love.Of course, above all, it's about Lili's journey , but the bond between her and Gerda is beautifully portrayed.

4,"It's not hard to see why this movie divides people. Some will always find a tale of an under-dog's trial over adversity compelling, no matter how clumsily it's told. And some will find a story about the manufacture of a mop dull, no matter how charismatic the characters or inspirational the telling of the tale. The problem here is that charisma and inspiration are in short supply. David O. Russell doesn't make much of the real strengths of the story. And he can't resist imposing his trademark style on characters and a story that really don't either warrant or suit it. So the characters are more than a little grotesque around the edges; the situations are all heightened, even given an absurdist spin; and the facts are never allowed to get in the way, even when they might actually strengthen the story. So much of Joy is desperately predictable, which makes for dispiriting viewing. And the real moments of surprise or pathos are just so much grist to the Russell mill. Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead, and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's about where the positives end. For the most part, Joy is a tedious mess. While it's a story that would probably never have been told without David O. Russell wanting to enhance it with his schtick, it's a story I wish they'd entrusted to anyone other than David O. Russell.",2015

Characters come and go without realizing what they should bring to the story. Add poor Isabella Rossellini to the mix (the most bizarre act I have seen in years) who has lines so unbearably surreal no one could possibly carry them without looking like a lunatic. Add nightmarish soap opera merging with the plot. Boom! No sense what-so-ever.

However, the storyline of a creative woman that lives with her dysfunctional family and invents a mop, becoming a successful woman, has a boring and dull story and consequently screenplay; in addition, the soundtrack is annoying. In the end, ""Joy"" is a waste of time and talented cast. My vote is three.",2016
3,"Well, what can I say? Joy is a plain, boring and uneventful movie lacking great performances from Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence (of course I wasn't expecting much from Bradley Cooper). The plot could have been interesting but the script completely ruined it I am not a fan of David Russell bu he did a really really bad job with Joy: his sequences don t make any sense, the narrator character choice is just pointless and many scenes are really hard to believe in. During the initial part of the movie, there were some funny bits which kept me moderately entertained but, after those 30 minutes, it was just plain boredom. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence won a Golden Globe for this is just unbelievable and proves what we all already know and what Ricky Gervais mentioned at the ceremony: all awards are bought by studios as a marketing campaign. Well, they succeeded, because I spent the money to see that, and I could not regret it more than I do.",2016
4,"Joy presents itself as an attempt of a fresh take on a very typical Oscar-bait movie: the biopic. Sadly, it doesn't go beyond the attempt.",2016
4,"Joy tells the story of a strong willed woman or, as our narrator concludes, the film is about all strong women everywhere. We are introduced to Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) as she plays outside her father Rudy's (Robert De Niro) auto shop store. We get glimpses of dysfunction within her family and then it spits us out somewhere between one surrealist scene in which Joy dreams about soap opera stars and her family harassing her and then it goes into her family life and why she is in the situation she's in. This patterns continues throughout the whole film, allowing us to never feel an ounce of concern over Joy and her miraculous mop. Why care about someone who can literally figure a way out of every unsavory situation she is in and into every beneficial situation she's in. There's no suspense, no wonder, no enchantment. This film feels like a biopic but ends up coming across as a half assed attempt at one as it blends the corniness of soap operas into the seriousness of David O. Russell as a filmmaker. In the end, it never works. Not even once as a film. Instead, the film subjects us to situations that Joy is in that we care nothing about. Whether it is mending things with her mother and father or fending off those looking for a free ride, you know before it even starts that Joy is going to get out of it. This makes for a painfully boring film. The performances are good here, as with any David O. Russell film (except this year's Accidental Love). Jennifer Lawrence is being Jennifer Lawrence. There's no acting required here for her. She can sleep walk through a strong willed woman role and she does so here. Despite being the lead role, Lawrence is the weakest link here. She was the weakest part of American Hustle and she is the weakest part here and it is a testament to Russell continuously casting her in roles that should be played by actresses ten years her senior. American Hustle it was pretty clear she was out of her element, there's no difference with Joy. She wallows in a mature aurora to her but it never really rings true no matter how hard Lawrence tries (and trust me, she does give her all here). It ends up being a good performance in a woefully miscast film. The supporting actors are plentiful, some even stealing whole scenes. One highlight here is Robert De Niro. Russell has proved he can get the absolute best out of De Niro. This is refreshing to see especially because we all thought he gave up with some of his recent film choices but De Niro can surprise us with touching performances in between playing cookie cutter gangsters and cops. Bradley Cooper is good here and will make you want more out of him but this is a showcase for Jennifer Lawrence so let your hopes down easy. Overall, Joy demonstrates that David O. Russell has a confident handle on his performers but it also proves that he is merely a carbon copy of Martin Scorsese (or at least he is trying to be). It is an uneven film that is inspired by Goodfellas in the way Joy's story is told and unfortunately for this film, gangsters are much more interesting than housewives making a fancy mop...no matter how kick ass that mop may be in real life, the film feels like a rip off in more ways than one.",2015
5,"If you think the story of a woman whose claim to fame is that she invented a 'miracle mop' and made millions selling it via TV shopping channels sounds a poor basis for a movie, watching Joy will do little to change your opinion. Despite its claims, there is little that is 'inspirational' or even particularly interesting about Joy Mangano's progress from schoolgirl to 'matriarch', at least as portrayed in this quasi-biopic.",2016
2,"Both the plot and acting in Joy are incredibly two-dimensional and stiff, and the time spent on different parts of the plot is grossly imbalanced. This means the film is particularly boring and completely fails to engage. Lawrence, Cooper, De Niro and others are so weak and uninteresting to watch here that it's amazing they've ever done good work. I'm so tired of seeing De Niro crinkle his brow and smirk his mouth as an expression of acting talent. He's gotten as bad as Jack Nicholson. And, Cooper and Lawrence are unbelievably lame here, too, as are the script and editing. There's no meaningful character development -- just ""drama"" that fails to engage or make you care and ""comedy"" that fails to make you laugh. All that time in the theater watching supposed stars and nothing but a yawn. This thing is LAME!! Don't waste your money...",2015

2,"Excellent actors and a fine story that could have been related in 6 minutes. A proper production team would know that most of this film should have ended up on the cutting room floor. The story of Joy and her travails is inspiring but this telling of it made this movie memorable to me for 1 reason; it's the 3rd movie I ever couldn't wait to end. DeNiro is an excellent actor all-around but it's evident that his career is in its dying days; it's so below him to have taken this role. Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job but, I hope for the sake of her future acting career, that there would be a way for her to erase this awful experience from her resume... or, at least to (mini- spoiler) bury it for 17 years.",2015
3,"How can you not like a movie with Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Niro? Take a David O. Russell screenplay only half based on entrepreneur Joy Magano's invention of the Miracle Mop, fill it with a series of implausible straw men, then knock them down over the course of two hours leading to the happy ending we all know is coming because it's the story of the successful Miracle Mop, not the Flop Mop. People have analogized Joy's situation to Cinderella, but it seemed to me more like Rocky. Each time poor Joy takes a punch and hits the canvas, we are rooting for her (""Get up, Joy!""). The problem is that each setback is completely avoidable and, thus, becomes infuriating to the viewer. Examples: Marketing guru, Bradley Cooper, agrees to get her product on QVC but gives it to a pitchman who has never used the product and doesn't like it. When Joy insists on demonstrating the product herself (which did happen), she is dressed in a fancy outfit- just the thing you'd wear when mopping a floor! Genius, Bradley Cooper! Then the parts supplier attempts to extort Joy by raising the prices after the success of the product. What, no contract covering this? When Joy learns her intellectual property rights are not protected, it is explained that her financial backer- who meticulously monitors the expenditure of every penny- has consulted a lawyer who is not an expert in IP rights. How meticulous! Everyone but Joy throws their hands up in despair saying there is nothing to be done but file bankruptcy. Here's a thought. How about suing the lawyer for legal malpractice for giving IP advice without any expertise? When Joy learns that the real IP holder is in Texas, Joy meets him in a motel room, spins out some convoluted explanation as to why his claim over the IP rights is ""fraud"" and gets him to sign a one page disclaimer of all IP rights right then and there without years of litigation. The longer this movie went on, the more I hated it. Except for Joy, none of the characters were likable. Some critics apparently find it impossible to be objective because of the pedigree of the David O Russell, JLaw, Bradley Cooper collaboration (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle). But, many IMDb viewers have been courageous enough to say this emperor had no clothes and I joint their ranks.",2016

And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's.",2015
8,"A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous ""war"" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.",2015

Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace.

The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned.

The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time!

It made sense in season 1 when they were both trying to clear Stark's (Jarvis' boss) name, but in season 2 it just seems weird.",2016
9,"What? A TV series that smells, acts and watches like a ""REAL"" movie? Yep, ""Agent Carter"" serves up real characters and some tight direction that takes us down the story line path that has a bit of a stench but one that we can so tolerate...Kinda like a sweet smelling onion...Kudos to Marvel and ABC for putting this on broadcast TV...Characters really die (over and over again) and the fight scenes are real intense but covered with cutaways to a radio serial being produced in a studio with sound effects and great VO's...What a surprise...What a treat...What DELICIOUS TV viewing...You HAVE to watch ""Agent Cater"" for this is one of those rare instances where TV steps up and truly entertains...",2015
9,"What usually makes me come to IMDb and write a review is anger at some really dumb show and the lazy ways its creators do it, hoping everybody under the sun is a complete fool. Then, I had never read or watched any comics or comics based production whether from Marvel or whatever. So, what made me come here to give this show 9 stars out of ten?",2015
10,"Agent Carter is my new favorite show for sure! After some of the sketchy plot lines and flat characters on Agents of SHIELD (though I love that show as well), I had some fears for this show, but after last night, all of these have been dispelled! Peggy, as always, is a complete and total badass and hero. The show depicts her battling misogyny in a way that is still so relevant today. In that respect, the show is inspiring and empowering to me personally and I'm guessing to all the other women watching. But it has so much more than a feminist aspect going for it! The fight sequences are BRUTAL and entertaining, the dialog is witty and realistic, and the plot so far has proved interesting and shows great promise for the future. All in all, after the 2 hours I got of Agent Carter last night, I think it definitely has a place up there with Marvel's best films! I sincerely hope that this show will be a successful endeavor, so that Marvel will take the hint and keep making more like it! The world could never have enough Agent Carters.",2015
8,The irony is that even die-hard Marvel fans may not be familiar with the legend of Agent Carter.,2015
1,"I found the lead character dull and predictable. Typical snarky come backs, typical everythign really. Too many supporting male characters seem to be written for the sole purpose of making men look bad, and giving Peggy an opportunity to outshine them, outsmart them, and make us feel terrible about something which has nothing to do with anyone living today...and franly I would much rather be a woman back then then now. Not being expected to work would be well worth it. So would having well bred men compliment you. Today the only people that compliment women are creeps in ""diverse"" neighborhoods. Imagine having a nice looking WASP( White AngloSaxon Protestant, for those who don't know) guy telling you how nice your hair looks, or how pretty your dress is in your office without the fear of sexual harassment charges. I think I will go build a time machine...anyhow..back to the show. It was cringy to watch, I am not surprised it got cancelled, it was as bad as a CW show. The spy story was not well thought out, and the only good thing about the show were the costumes, cars, backgrounds, and production in general. But even a well polished turd is still a turd.",2017
10,"After the first two episodes I am completely hooked. This show is not only a great Marvel show which has already given some back story to pre-existing Marvel Cinematic Universe characters and plot lines that may end up being important in later films, it is all around an exciting thriller. The female-lead show does not focus on Peggy's romantic life, but on her work life as a member of the USR, the ""original"" S.H.I.E.L.D. Peggy continuously shows how strong of a woman she is, and proves herself over and over again, despite the thoughts of her male coworkers. She is a great role model for women and girls, showing that your gender should not matter in the workplace, and you can be as strong and tough as you'd like without sacrificing femininity. As an added bonus, the show passes the Bechdel test in the first three minutes, something many shows fail to do in their entire series run. This show is a must watch for fans of action, spies, Marvel, and people who want to see a strong woman who doesn't put up with the patriarchy.",2015

3,"I appear to be in the minority, so I'll make this brief. Loaded with clichés, obviousness, and irritating simple-minded moralizing, Agent Carter's first season begins enjoyably enough and quickly sours, only to get worse and more ridiculous as the season progresses. The noble comic relief as British butler, the charming womanizer, the bullies in suits who stand in for law enforcement, a tangent into war-story romanticism, a completely uncaptivating villain with a disappointingly silly superpower, all blended together with clunky pacing. I'll give a couple points for (some) decent acting, and it does look great. There's no way I'm coming back for season 2, however.",2015
2,"I've just finished watching the pilot of this show,and I have really no idea what I was just watching. It seem like some sort of 1930's female Dick Tracy.Though it's suppose to take place in 46,but the set looks and feel more like the 30s. But the really sad part is, you don't get a feel for the characters. Which again makes you end up not caring what happens to them. If you can't identify with the characters, you lose interest fast.And that happened to me after the first 15 min.I simply got bored. I get the impression the studios are so desperate to market the marvel franchise ,that they'll slap the name on anything to sell it. This show might have been good as a stand alone 1930/40s thriller/Drama noir,but instead you get the feeling they have hastily slapped this together after the audience picked up on agents of shield. I give them two stars simply cause the backdrop looked real",2015

She was when introed in Captain America: The First Avenger and even more here and I loved her dialogue with Edwin Jarvis (James D'Arcy), Howard Stark's butler. The first season in New York when she started working for SSR, and the second season in Los Angeles had such compelling plots and characterizations, I never was bored watching the whole thing!

It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the ""thug"" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on ""Hip Hop"" culture.

Not that their life stories aren't bad or respected it's just the movie was all about rewarding ignorance I feel like anyone that watched this has been tainted it's not the cast, I respect some of the cast it just put the wrong message out to people especially the ones underage that will watch this.

1,"This is a typical movie that glorifies one party and demonizes another. There are three sides of the story: party A, party B, and the truth. Cops had just as much reason to target young black men as young black men had reason to target innocent people in the streets. The thing that should not be glorified encouraged in young people who are inspired by this film is the terrible attitudes and general lack of respect for anyone. Aside from the dominating racial theme of this movie, the truth of the events that took place is stretched to put it lightly. Fact checking any number of the scenes that were portrayed will lead you to see that the facts were warped in order to convey the story that they wanted rather than the truth. Along with the fictitious plot-line, the acting is cheesy and not believable. There is no stand out performance and one can expect that, as this is many of these young actors' first big time film.

I like NWA, and I liked them all as solo artists, so believe me when I say that this isn't an indictment on their musical talent, but still this movie really annoyed me less than halfway into it.

As far as the stories behind the music we were left with what little we heard on MTV news, read in the few gossip columns of magazines and word of mouth. That's why I was eager to see this movie. With social media now we know every step everyone takes-and they are aware of that-so I was looking forward to seeing a depiction of a time before that.

The best bits are of the band shaping their first album. The rest should be read in books and preferably forgotten. It's not hard to see why Ice Cube went on to surpass what Dre did later, even on his first solo album. I wish one would hear more dissing of Dre courtesy of Eazy-E, buuut--Eazy's dead, so Dre's words take precedence, I guess. And there's even a whole buckload of distasteful ad for beats headphones at the end of the film. Truly bad.",2016

I think N.W.A and Eazy's story differ perhaps from the perspective of cube and Dre. There wasn't much about MC Ren in the movie and being a fan of M C Ren and Eazy, I found hat disappointing. Dre's role was played well and Dre was the realest in contributing towards the truth in the writing of the story. All in all we want Eazy-e movie on it's own and this time man the f**k up and let em know he gave you your success. They made him look younger than the rest in the movie and he was the eldest.

4,First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree.,2015
4,"""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most talked-about films from this year and it gives us an insight into the rise and fall of the successful hip-hop posse ""NWA"". And even if I am not too interested in rap music, I cannot deny having heard of some of the main characters such as Suge Knight and Dr. Dre of course. Maybe my lack of interest in this film is because I have not lived back then yet or wasn't old enough to follow these significant years in hip hop history. The director is F. Gary Gray and you may have seen his work ""Law Abiding Citizen"". Another problem I had with Compton is that it just felt too long for its own good. There was nothing really refreshing in here, pretty much everything expected, such as the guys' struggles with (predominantly white) policemen, authority arguments with other black people living in the hood etc. Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti may be the most known name in the cast here playing a prominent record company boss and even if he is good as usual, he cannot make this film a memorable watch either.",2015
4,"I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their ""music"" became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this. ",2015
8,"I am compelled to write my first review after 4 years on IMDb due to the bad reviews by critics. First off, I completely enjoyed this movie.

If filmmakers can take a comic book issue and make a good movie based on the story, I wonder, was this script written on the inside of a matchbook? The story begins and ends but that's basically it. It's boring, slow and unimaginative. It does not hurt to watch the movie, it's a pretty beautiful illustration but it leaves no lasting aftertaste. Do not pass this movie if you like the genre but save it for a bad weather day. Feels awkward to say that I give this movie 4 because it was well made so I rather put it that this movie lost 6 stars because it was boring.",2015
6,"It's odd that a medieval fantasy movie with respectable cast nearly flies off radar. Last Knights is not an epic tale, in fact the plot heavily resembles that of 47 Ronin and considering even Keanu Reeves' journey is inspired by multitude of per-existing works, this plot is unoriginal at best. The pacing is slow, creating a rather bloated runtime. Still, the cast as well as cinematography produce nice atmosphere, especially in latter half, just making Last Knights a moderately enjoyable popcorn flick.",2015
5,"'Last Knights' is a story about... well, I kind of had to work out the premise as I went along. It's safe to say that it's set in a 'fictional' world of make believe. It's based on an old Japanese Tale and then imported to a sort of Western culture, only during medieval times, hence the use of 'knights' over 'samurais.' If you've seen the marketing then you can't fail to miss Morgan Freeman's face on the front cover. He's basically sharing top-billing with Clive Owen, only he's not really in it for the film's full duration, leaving any die-hard fans possibly feeling a little short-changed. The story focuses on Clive Owen, as the leader of a band of knights and their attempts to right the wrongs done to them and their people.",2015
10,"A great movie with all imaginable letters. A reference and a great tribute to the 47 Ronin, not that of Keanu Reeves thing, but the true 47 Ronin of Mizoguchi and Kunio Watanabe. Thanks to producers by these 2h unforgettable.",2015
4,"""The code was simple: Possess an absolute devotion to one's Master.""  Last Knights is Japanese director, Kazuaki Kiriya's third feature film,  but his first one with well known Hollywood actors. What he attempts to  do here is blend the familiar story of the 47 Ronin and adapt it to the  Medieval world of knights. Why would you want to trade samurai soldiers  for knights? I have no idea because it actually doesn't work. You have  these men living by a code of honor similar to the samurai, but there  is nothing fresh or unique about the idea because the entire story  becomes completely predictable and generic. During this feudal world,  Captain Raiden (Clive Owen) is completely devoted to serving the house  of Bartok (Morgan Freeman), his wealthy and caring Master. Second in  command is another loyal knight, Lt. Cortez (Cliff Curtis). These  knights live by a strong code of honor and respect for their Master,  but when Bartok is dishonored by the Emperor's corrupt adviser, Gezza  Mott (Aksel Hennie), the knights are dismantled. Will the knights be  able to rise again and avenge their Master or will they fall into  despair and go back to their old ways? If you've seen any samurai movie  you probably know what to expect.   The greatest issue I had with Last Knights is its lack of originality.  We've seen the film played out many times before and that makes the  pacing of the film feel incredibly tedious because we know what is  going to happen next. Kiriya tries to take his time establishing the  setting and building the characters, but since we've seen this world  before it doesn't do anything for the audience. Clive Owen is a fine  actor, but he's even played this role before in King Arthur, a knight  who is completely devoted to the cause. Morgan Freeman is one of those  actors who you could close your eyes just to hear him speak and that is  basically why he's in this, to narrate the introduction of the film and  set the premise. Last Knights can easily be divided into three acts,  the first being the introduction of each character and the injustice  they must face, the second which takes up most part of the film centers  on the build-up of each character, and the third part of the film and  by far the most exciting is the climax where vengeance is coming. The  problem is that neither the introduction or the character development  manage to engage the audience and everything is taken way too seriously  for us to be entertained by it.   The characters are completely one dimensional. Only Clive Owen gets to  play a meaty role, but everyone else is simply playing a stereotypical  character in a film like this. And even watching Owen on screen you  can't help but feel the familiarity of having seen him play this role  before. The villain is perhaps the best example of how stereotypical  the characters in this film are. You couldn't have Aksel Hennie play a  more evil or sadistic man than he is here: he beats his wife, abuses  people, accepts bribes from other noble men, and to top things off he  hurts animals. He's also a coward who surrounds himself with thousands  of guards and a heavy fortified home. That is what actually makes the  final climax scene quite entertaining. The action is delivered quite  well and it makes up for some of the tedious pacing during the first 80  minutes of the film. Is it enough to recommend the film? Not even  close.",2015
9,"After reading the initial reviews of this movie I thought it might be a bit of a turkey. However, I like these type of movies so I thought I would give it 15-20 minutes and see how it goes. Happily, it went well, I was hooked on the storyline and the acting. Clive Owen was fantastic as he usually is in these type of roles, Morgan Freeman, again one of his better movies, and the supporting cast all very well acted. The CGI was good but plot and acting outshone it, which is a really good thing in my opinion. Anyway, I really do recommend this film to those people who like this genre. So please do not listen to the negative reviews to much, watch it for 15 minutes and then decide for yourself if it's for you.",2015
3,"The story of 47 Ronin is one of the greatest stories of chivalry, loyalty, and honour in history. It is a fascinating study of the uncompromising nature of a samurai under the code of Bushido.

4,"First, I have to say that I did enjoy watching it. Perhaps it was seeing (spoiler alert!!!) the 2013 47 Ronin just the other day that gave the story a bit of a stale taste to it, though. It is pretty plain to see that the story follows the same historical template. The movie seems nicely directed and all the characters are well balanced. Peyman Moaadi really played the role of the emperor well but also Aksel Hennie did shine as the villain Gezza Mott. Especially the latter role might have easily been overplayed. The effects, props and makeup are well done, which is another point where such a straight forward movies, following a well-known story, may easily could have failed. We have good action and a solid story untainted by trashiness but also without any real surprise. There is the hero, Owen as Raiden, who (spoiler!!!) seems to become a drinker, which is however a scheme that is revealed only towards the last part of the movie. While it is nicely done, it is likely not come as a surprise.",2015

Ah I've got it now Owen will be playing a medieval king and Freeman will be playing a character picked up from his travels , you can still have non-white characters in a movie set in Europe five hundred years ago . Oh hold on Morgan Freeman plays the king ! Add to this Indian and Asiatic cast members and you've got something that doesn't really work ",2015
8,"Usually my tastes align pretty much with the score than MetaCritic (and RottenTomatoes) gives for a particular movie. This is one of the few exceptions to that rule. I disclaimer: I am Japanese and live in Japan, and have a sweet tooth for old school Japanese dramas (not just the masters like Kurosawa and Juzo Itami) and styles that some people might not have the taste for. Note that in Japan this movie is getting good reviews -- but that's probably due to the Japanese director and the Japanese actors in it. However, there is a lot of Korean influence (according to the credits) in it as well.",2015

The reasoning is that a challenge to the Minister is also a challenge to the Emperor and must be dealt with by death. Bartok did have the opportunity to kill Gezze Mott and regretted not doing so. The Emperor rules that Raiden must carry out Bartok's death sentence. Well, this wasn't in the cards. (it was in the script, however)",2015

This movies has it all. If you want to see gore and dragons,this isn't for you It is a fictional work,in a fictional world. I gave the movies a 10,some would say i over rated it,but i liked the movie and i thing it deserves the rating. I especially like the fact that the film takes place in a world where racial differences are non existent,religion is hardly mentioned,it is all about Honor,Morality,and accepting responsibility for our own acts.",2015
8,"Although setting reminds us middle-age Europe, film created a fantasied world in which there is a nation consisted of different races such as blacks,Asian,middle-easterners and westerners. In this way it reminds me Game of Thrones. There are multi cultural aspects from far east to the Europe in a variety of ways such as architecture, language and clothing. First scenes are pretty exciting and plot gets you but after a while it becomes boring as there is not action. But then you get into action again and until the last minute you feel the head indeed. Its a worthwhile to watch for the people who are addicted to such series as game of thrones and vikings.",2015
1,"This feels like it's trying too hard without actually putting any effort into it. Its many failures begins with the script. There is absolutely no character development which makes it hard to truly root for a character. There is no relationship development either, you are just presented with ""titles"", a commander, a master, a minister, an Emporer, etc. but you never learn of how their relationships truly came to be therefor don't feel the connections, the closeness, the hatred, etc. ",2015

7,"This movie had a bit too much buildup and not enough action for the first two thirds of the movie. And yet I was still drawn in and it held my attention. So when the action did come it was fast and tense. I think the ""professional"" reviewers have given this movie far too bad a rap. It isn't going to win it's actors any academy awards but for what it is, it does more than passingly well and a lot better than most that have come before it. Even though this movie is based on the Japanese legend of the 47 ronin and transplanted into a pseudo medieval European style fantasy film, it still manages to make the story feel somewhat fresh and the inevitable ending makes you wonder if it's the one expected or not. For me, when a movie makes me wish there was just five more minutes, then it has accomplished something and gets bonus points. This one did so.",2015
1,"I was curious and very interested to watch this movie. Firstly because in this movie unexpectedly director (Kazuaki Kiriya) cover themes like equality, multicultural society, ethnicity, race and all of this in the Middle Ages. Secondly because in this movie played very good actors like Clive Owen, Morgan Freeman, Cliff Curtis and Aksel Hennie.

9,There were scenes in this movie when I literally felt as if my heart was going to pound its way out of my chest. Among other scenes I'm thinking of the extremely quease-inducing one where the Dwyers have to leap from one building roof to another to escape those trying to kill them - and as part of it they actually have to throw their young children across the open space from one roof to another. I could barely watch that scene. And has there been a more horrific scene filmed than the one in which young Lucy Dwyer (who can't be more than 10) has a gun put to her head and another in her hands and is told she'll be killed unless she kills her father. There are several times in this movie where the title seems to be the only possible conclusion. Surely there's no escape for this family.,2015
8,"""No Escape"" is set in an anonymous South East Asia country bordering Vietnam facing a violent civil war, with the uprising triggered by perceived foreign imperialist intervention. The film was shot in Thailand but looks and feels like Cambodia. Having had the fortune to spend time in Cambodia and be immersed in its troubling history, this feels well positioned: the economic premise at the heart of the film – that governments invest in loss-leading foreign-aid, in this case water treatment, to 'buy' future strings of the leadership - is controversial but has the ring of truth about it. Countries like Cambodia have been used as political footballs by the Super Powers for many years, and are pressure-cookers of injustice and discontent. ",2015
8,"The American engineer Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is expatriated to Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and befriends the English Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) at the airport. Nobody from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers (Sahajak Boonthanakit). Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone, Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and Jack does not speak or read the language of the country. ",2015
9,"I went to this movie because I was curious -- Owen Wilson NOT in a comedy?? I was pleasantly surprised. Owen Wilson nailed it -- a loving father trying *desperately* to save his family. Yes, this situation has been done a zillion times before (for example, THREE ""Taken"" movies) -- but I've never seen it done with this much intensity. The movie's focus was not on the ""action."" Rather, the focus was on the interplay between the parents/kids, how they dealt with each other and the various situations, providing a deeply human touch against a horrifically inhuman background (a massacre). And it was this extreme contrast, of the human vs the inhuman, that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.",2015
9,"I went in to this movie not expecting much. having read some reviews online prior i had my hopes set a little higher as many people said the intensity of the movie was high. the reviews did not do that justice. this might be one of the most relentless in your face movies i have ever seen. once things start to go wrong and believe me it does not take long at all, it rarely ever gives you a chance to breathe.

It's the Prime Minister (of an unnamed country), and before we know it, the Prime Minister is murdered. The movie then switches to ""17 Hours Earlier"", as we get to know the Dwyer family as they are en route to Southeast Asia: Jack (played by Owen Wilson), Annie (played by Lake Bell), and their two young daughters Lucy and Beeze. During the flight they also meet Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan), who has visited the country 15 times and knows the place inside out. Upon arrival at their hotel, Annie comments ""Welcome to the fourth world!"", as there is no functioning TV, phone or internet. The next morning Jack goes for a walk to by a US newspaper, and inadvertently gets mixed up in a stand-off between demonstrators and police in riot gear. At this point, we are not yet 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2015

Pretty graphic I must say, which is the only reason I did not give it a 9 or 10, but well written with an excellent plot. Going in I was a little apprehensive as to how good Owen Wilson was going to be in an ""action"" movie but he did not disappoint. A tad unbelievable given his build and stature as to what he was able to do from a physical standpoint in the movie but still kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. All in all I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and suspense.",2015
7,"John Erick Dowdle's ""No Escape"" is a taut thriller, nicely edited and strongly paced, resulting in a film that knows exactly how to get your adrenaline up and your movie-going senses tingled. Dowdle has been a strong force in the horror genre ever since his seldom-seen, largely unreleased debut ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes"" came onto the scene in 2007. Since then, Dowdle has proved his ability to direct claustrophobic thrillers such as ""As Above, So Below"" and ""Devil,"" solidifying his filmography as dynamic and rounded, especially for a horror/thriller director.",2015

Where most movies nowadays rely on special effects and unrealistic action and superhero powers to capture the viewers, this movie is built on real danger to an innocent family.

But even if you don't have kids, if you're human you will feel the danger and emotion in this film.",2015
7,"I didn't have high expectations for the picture before watching, given the rating and having seen that it's an Action with Owen Wilson (you know) and Pierce Brosnan whom I haven't enjoyed seeing him in any pictures since 007, This movie has proved to deserve a rating higher than it's current 6.8. the message it sends is clear and courageous as to expose that western politics do have interests in other lands and they would do above and beyond to reach their goals. while the plot had a dimension of truth in that, and it also contains some highly thrilling scenes that will put you on edge at different points of the movie... in summary i enjoyed watching this picture and I would wish more producers and directors would work more towards producing movies with such courageous message to make people aware of how things are in this world.",2015
9,"I read some of the people who wrote that the movie portrayed negativity about ""yellow people"". These are people who view people only by color, but act like they are standing up for them. Pitiful. The movie portrays a condition that can exist anywhere and that has existed in almost every country. The movie was a constant thrill. Pierce just keeps getting better. We watched this on Thanksgiving with 6 of us an we all loved it. One of the characteristics that make a big difference is the costume dept. This movie captured every appropriate detail from hair to teeth to dirt to blood. Well done. We also appreciated the editing. Very nice flow between scenes where you always knew where you were while watching.",2015
8,"I always enjoyed Owen Wilson's comedies but I still recall his Behind Enemy lines role and he did it so perfect! In this movie too, I did expect him to do a fantastic job in a serious role and he just crosses all your expectations! Pierce Brosnon was was amazing in this movie, though not that much of a screen time he shares, but shines in whatever time he gets on screen. The child actors and the female lead did their job fair n square. The slow motions used are so perfectly timed in this movie and go so well with the background scores.",2015

5,Greetings again from the darkness. An effective thriller must either put real people smack dab in the middle of believable peril or facilitate the suspension of disbelief. This latest from writer/director John Erick Dowdle (co-written with his brother Drew Dowdle) takes bits of each of those approaches and provides a pretty intense ride  despite the mostly nonsensical happenings.,2015
10,This thriller about an American family caught up in a bloody coup in an unnamed South East Asian country is exciting from start to finish. It's a fictional thriller with elements of some real terror we have seen in true stories like 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'The Killing Fields'. The on location (Thailand) filming is atmospheric.,2015
9,"I don't know why lately in IMDb i have found that very nice movies, have very bad ratings. 6.8 for this movie? Really? For me it have it all. It's building the whole intense step by step, and put the audience to the heart of this family, how they arrive there and what are the first difficulties they face. In every movie, i believe we have to ""make the movie situation ours"" as i say often, i mean understand usually the motives and the situation that the protagonist is. I believe the whole movie escalating very nicely, with a beautiful touch on the end, i wont say more so i wont spoil it. ",2015
10,"Oh man, what can I say? This is really one intense movie. I felt like I couldn't breath at certain points. However, the plot is definitely unrealistic as this kind of violence will never take place in any Asian countries nowadays. Also, I think the movie's plot is somewhat messed up. The people in the movie were supposed to be Thai but everything else was not really Thai (e.g., the protesters, the junta government, all the signs, the brothel). Furthermore, Thailand shares no border with Vietnam. I would say that this movie gives such a false (and almost unfair) portrayal of the country. Putting the plot aside, however I do think this is one excellent and intense movie. I had such a great time watching it. This level of intensity in this movie reminds me of the movie ""Taken"". Overall, I think this movie is really worth seeing.",2015

9,"The best summary I saw here said, ""Superb show not for faint hearts or the lazy."" That about sums it up. I'm shocked at all the negative reviews here.",2016
9,"From the first episode I found this show to be mesmerizing. The dark, cold atmosphere of the area is well depicted but doesn't depress. The characters are true to life and all seem to have their histories, loves and hates. The community is close knit although the inhabitants come from various parts of the world. The determined FBI agent sent to the town is viewed with suspicion.The woolly mammoth that was dug up early on in the series lies in a shed and one feels the menace emanating from its carcass. Is this the source of the horrors? The story unfolds slowly but dramatically, the build up is excellent. From the start it keeps the watcher thinking is this sci fi or is there another dark secret. Can't wait for the second season.",2015
5,"Having completed the entire first season, I must admit I was disappointed. I don't know if I was falsely expecting a different kind of show or it was Fortitude producers' blame to having created totally different expectations to its viewers, but the show gradually ruined every positive characteristic it had when it started. Although there were all the necessary ingredients to make a dark, Hitchcock-styled crime & mystery series, the decision of the producers to turn Fortitude into a Supernatural-kind of show totally destroyed it. The amazing landscaping, the cold and intriguing ambiance of a closed, isolated society, the mysterious people living in the city, from so many different backgrounds, gave Fortitude a great beginning and made us believe it would keep the pace up until the end, offering us a modern, North-Pole alternative of Twin Peaks. Instead, we were given a disappointing metaphysical turn of the plot, some really disturbing and violent images and characters gradually becoming less and less interesting. By the end of the show, I caught myself looking forward to the finale, tired of the swallow plot. A total disappointment, unfortunately...",2015
8,"Fortitude is not your typical drama. It moves slowly, like the ice locked landscape in which it is set. ",2015
9,"I don't believe IMDb anymore. This is a really interesting show, intriguing and enigmatic. It's probably too complicated for many on here who cannot connect the dots because of its complicated story-line. Brilliantly acted and beautifully filmed. I am totally hooked and cannot wait for the next episode. By no stretch can this be called boring. I am slowly learning that there are many on here who cannot discern good TV or movies. I was shocked to the core recently that most people liked 'I Saw the Devil,' A ridiculous South Korean movie and gave it high ratings, when it is the biggest pile of drivel ever committed to film. Watch it and see. My goodness, it is bad, but Fortitude has my backing for sure. I realise that we all have different tastes, but in a court of law, Fortitude would be vindicated as good but I Saw the Devil would be laughed out of court for the pile of dross that it is.",2015
9,"Fortitude is a great show: exotic, thrilling, well played, with an outstanding story.",2015
10,"I've just seen the first episode and wow I'm hooked already! The beautiful scenery and landscape shots are as big a star as the amazing cast. Every character is mysterious and mesmerising and the plot is deep, dark and luscious. The director does a great job of setting the feel of the place. You really soak up the hostile environment and I even started to feel cold at points. Characters all behave realistically in the unforgiving environment and all have very believable interactions and traits. Believe me when I say this is not the usual dross churned out by the big production companies these days. Anyone who enjoys gritty, suspenseful and intelligent TV will enjoy this immensely.",2015
8,/refers to Season 1/,2015
6,"I wish the producers had bothered to learn just a smidgeon about winters and Norway when making such a series. A) Even those who should be Norwegian rarely had Norwegian names B) The police had more weapons than the complete Norwegian police force (well, not quite, but you get the drift), but CHILDREN cycling around with hunting rifles in town? Did they think it was Texas, just colder? C) Reindeer and polar bears together? Not in Norway, not on Svalbard. D) When it is VERY cold (30 C below) the snow makes a certain sound, and it does not turn to slush. E) Except for a few instances the people mumbling in Norwegian did not sound very Norwegian, even the chef in the Muppets was better. F) Wasps do how well in the cold, hm? G) Norwegians do not wear their shoes indoors, especially when it is cold and wet outside. It makes everything dirty, you see, and we do not like dirt in our houses. H) When it is cold, seriously cold, people usually cover their ears and button up their jackets. And they seldom wear gloves, but mittens.",2015

9,"This is a high class, high production value series. Well-written, well-acted with important and also unsettling themes. The start does make demands of the viewer but it is worth sticking with as all will, eventually, become clear. Far, far better than the dross that is so often served up on TV. Not everyone will have enjoyed this series because it is intricate, has a number of story lines running throughout and has a slow burning Scandinavian-style pace. There are surprises and real, genuine shocks combined with genuinely scary parts. The mirroring of characters' actions and movements is used a lot and works very well. Music is used to very good effect and is of high quality. There is humour and horror (some truly eye-shutting moments). I loved the development of characters and their links. The cinematography is wonderful, as is some of the visual imagery: favourites, apart from landscapes, were blood on snow and the 'Viking' burial. Themes of infatuation and obsession, love, protection, violence, greed and that all actions have consequences. We have just watched it a second time to pick up all the little things we missed the first time around e.g. The foreshadowing. Not a show that can be easily pigeon-holed as a specific genre. Very, very happy that there will be a second series. Unreservedly recommended.",2015
9,The first two scenes of Fortitude tells you where this is heading. A recollection of man's death whilst being attacked by a polar bear and the discovery of an ancient mammoth corpse. Fortitude is about unravelling what happened in the past from the current evidence. The truth hides itself behind the character's attempts to keep their own past a secret from one another. That's why they have all ended up in a town on the edge of the Arctic - to hide their pasts in the snow and ice.,2015

5,"This series had so much potential, and I really gave it a chance and held back from reviewing after the first few episodes, hoping it would improve. Well, now we're at episode 10. The storyline is intriguing, but at this stage I really just want to find out what happens and forget about it. The dialogue and everything is so badly written that it's cringe-worthy at times. Unless, of course, the show creators' intention was to suggest that EVERYONE on the island - not just the known victims so far - is infected by some rare virus that makes them behave in strange, stupid, and at times absurdly melodramatic ways. Well acted, beautifully shot, miserably written. I find it hard to sympathise much with any of the characters, for the simple reason that they all seem a bit daft and behave/react in ways that human beings ordinarily don't. And not only that - the people definitely don't interact the way small town folk in the frozen north would do. I can't help thinking that this show is trying way too hard to be something it has miserably failed to be. People mention Twin Peaks, but I don't know, it's so far off the mark it's not even funny. If one of the hallmarks of great drama is a deep understanding of human nature and the human condition, then this is miserably failed drama. It may as well have been written by aliens from outer space whose only knowledge of human behaviour is from scientific research - clearly useful, but on its own far short of the mark if you want to really entertain other humans.",2015

5,"Fortitude was a mixed bag for me. I did finish watching the whole of Season One, but frankly found it a bit of an effort. I won't really say, what the whole storyline was, but I guess it was interesting enough a premise for me to continue to the end. I honestly found it, a hard slog at times. I don't know if it was the editing, acting, directing, or writing but Fortitude just didn't gel for me. There were frequent moments when I thought ' what is going on?' Someone described this as a psychological thriller. I didn't see any real psychology, I didn't see any thriller elements. Ultimately I just didn't get it. I can see from other reviews, that some people loved this. And they must be keenly awaiting Season Two. I felt Season One was dragged out to the hilt. And honestly, what other big interesting secrets can be waiting in Season Two? Ultimately the location was one of the best things about this series. Acting, writing, editing ,and directing were I felt very average.",2015
3,"Fortitude has a wonderful cast & the location is beautiful. However the show is a writer's bin full of poorly constructed storyline & unbelievable characters. Basically it's the inhabitants of an English town dumped in Denmark, all of whom are on a paranoid acid trip.",2015

3,"Yes, there are spoilers in this review. I'm reviewing the series, not an episode, since I watched all 12.",2016
6,"Fortitude remains interesting, though it relies too much on shock and violence to cover a very slow pace. It's as though the glacier has decided to tell the story of itself and the flea-like humans speckled across its surface; there's a bleak grandeur behind it all, but viewers may lose patience. Mammoth rot or environmental poisoning or demonic possession or whatever, the whole shaggy dog aspect of the series is dangerously close to being a bit dull, until someone stabs someone with a fork or pukes up in their belly or saws their head in half. The sudden gore is necessary; the story could not maintain much interest without it, and that's a real weakness for a drama. For a horror series, it's probably par the course. ",2015
1,"We watched the first part because it was so absurd to result fascinating, but the second has been really beyond any possibility of forgiveness: things happen just because, characters do not know what they want or even what they are, violent and gory just in order to carry on, and in the end you realize that there certainly be a third part. Beware of it!!!",2017
6,"Set in an Arctic mining town, which is just coming out of a 30 'day' period of night, think ""30 days of night,"" and you'll get the idea. The purpose of this episode is to quickly sketch out all the main characters, as well as the secondary ones, and towards the last 3rd we get the murder. The story, such as we are told, surrounds a mining town with soon to be depleted mines switching its economy to tourism. To do this, the town governor has launched an ice hotel project, which will see the construction of an ice hotel in the glacier on which the town is built. The fly in the governor's ointment is the scientist, Eccleston, who runs the Arctic Research Centre. He is on the cusp of delivering a report into the environmental impact of the proposed hotel but before he can do so, he is approached by a local looking to sell an artifact. This may, or may not, be the remains of a prehistoric creature. We are left guessing. Eccleston then argues with the governor that the hotel may not be viable, depending on the nature of the find.",2015
5,Lemme guess he used to be great but 'threw it all away'. He's on a mission of personal redemption. Every one love hates him. He falls in love with his chief competition who of course hates him and adores him. He's substituted drugs and booze for being a colossal a-hole user of people because he's just that talented. He IS the most interesting man in the world. Before him no one ate food. Other than that this is movie where you hear Bradley speak pretty French where you watch people make and eat pretty good food and there's a lot and I mean a lot of histrionics.,2017
6,"Movies like burnt are so frustrating to watch and in cases like this, the fault almost always lies with the director and / or meddling producers. I am not 100% sure, but I believe that this script was on the black list and even if it was not it probably was damn good to attract the acting talent to such a project. The acting was well done (no pun intended) and none of the actors mailed in their performance. So why does the sum equal less than the parts?",2016

I'm not normally a fan of Bradley Cooper, however i was amazed to see his acting talents here and how true he was to a real chef. Definitely a game changer for his career after being unimpressed with him in hangover or wedding crashes.",2015
3,"""It must be great. Bradley Cooper acts in award winning film."" But no. It's the same movie that every other actor has done at least once in their career. The lead is arrogant, chip on their shoulder, lacks social skills, loner by choice... There is sexual tension with opposite sex (usually) supporting character. This tension helps the lead start to let down their guard. Something happens that upsets the lead so bad they are worse than every before. Then the lead has a mental break down. The opposite sex character helps pick them up. Usually at that same time the sexual tension is broken. The lead makes peace with their demons from the past. Voila!! He/she is no longer an angry prick but a lovable person with great social skills. It all revolves around an unique career, skill or hobby. The only reason to watch the film. In this movie it is world class chef, but it could be a snake milker, innovative uke player or a deep sea crab hunter.",2016

8,"Despite some pretty bad reviews I think it's a pretty strong movie. Especially for people who love to cook of like high-end dining, it's a great movie. Burnt gives an excellent look in the world of high- end dining and professional kitchens. Bradley Cooper puts on a good performance and makes the experience very real. The evolution his character makes may be a little predictable, but I think that's not a bad thing. You should not underestimate the acting skills of Bradley Cooper. The character is written for him in my opinion. Also the character that's played by Daniel Brühl, Tony, is an interesting one and I think that Daniel performs this role outstandingly. Tony is a very proper and tight man, but his character evolves during the movie into a very pleasant one. Brühl makes his character very real with the accent and a particular way he moves in. The plot of the movie may be a little predictable, but that's not a problem. I think all the roles are filled in nicely and all of the characters make the story into a real experience, not only about cooking but also about the difficult world of a Michelin-star restaurant. Summarized I can say this movie is a must-see for people who love cooking and things like that. It's not a mind-blowing story, but in combination with some great acting it makes the movie worth watching. An average of 6,7 is way to low for this movie in my opinion.",2016
2,"A sorry excuse of a film. Awful writing, from the plot to the terrible dialogs. There are so many goofs regarding what a real chef does in a high class kitchen, that you could fill pages with them. Too many inconsistencies, one after another. Examples: a two-star Michelin chef does not ""do everything"" by himself, shouting constantly at all his staff; he does not do the starters, the main courses AND dessert. There are ""sub-chefs"" who specialize in different items.",2016

8,"Burnt (my latest review) is well done. There I said it. Let's get all the puns out of the way shall we. With fast cutting that will make your head spin, close-ups of food that will cause your mouth to water (even though I noshed right before a viewing, I still had a hearty appetite), and a showcase for what I believe to be the best performance of Bradley Cooper's career, this 2015 release is only the third foodie flick I've seen. No Reservations and Chef are the other two and they're mere child's play in comparison.",2015

I have read the other reviews that say no real character development and superfluous characters. Maybe. The world of high end cooking is so interesting. Watching them make fabulous meals inspired me to come home and cook something new for dinner. Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) is a flawed man. Everyone in this film was pretty flawed. I liked the whole cast, and forgot Sienna Miller was in American Sniper with BC until I read it on IMDb tonight. I liked the European and US settings. Not Oscar material but good enough. No blood, no guts, some cursing, lots of ego. If you like Bradley, go see it.",2015

8,"First I had some doubts about this film - while I was watching the trailer I thought it's going to be a failure even though it's Bradley Cooper we are talking about. But it got my attention immediately, right at the beginning with that cool soundtrack! The film has his own dynamics and it keeps the trill till the end. I also enjoyed the mysterious past of Adam(Bradley) which was chasing him for the hole movie. In the end, not a great movie, but definitely a good one - my 8 is because it's different and well served :P So, in short: chefs, delicious food, chasing past, good soundtracks, Bradley, Sienna...Enjoy!",2015
9,"Burnt (2015): Dir: John Wells / Cast: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys: John Wells presents a realistic view of the hectic work in a kitchen as well as a professional so good at his job that all he can do is sink in despair in hopes of regaining success again. Bradley Cooper plays chef Adam Jones who walked out on a job in a restaurant in Paris thus creating enemies out of former co-workers and employers whose business suffered as a result. He owes money to heavies and struggles with drugs. Now he desires to return to the restaurant business but his dominating personality and his forceful desire to succeed creates divisions with everyone. Cooper plays off the anxiety of someone aiming to be the best yet struggling to erase mistakes. Sienna Miller plays single mother Helene, an accomplished chef in her own right who is reluctantly enlisted by Jones. Conflict follows allowing these two actors a better platform than what American Sniper gave them. Daniel Bruhl plays the homosexual manager of the restaurant that employs Jones. He is frustrated with Jones and his fitful antics but comes to terms with the fact that it comes with dealing with the best in the business. There is great supporting roles that form the core people whom Jones had screwed earlier in Paris. One ends up getting revenge at a pivotal moment, while another ends up demonstrating surprise grace when Jones attempts to suffocate himself inside his restaurant. This is a film about second chances and giving chances to those around us that can prevent us from burning ourselves out and further assisting us in our goals. Score: 9 / 10",2015
9,"6 November 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - Burnt. Bradley Cooper stars as chef Adam Jones, who having lost everything is clawing his way back to the top in quest to gain that elusive third Michelin Star. On the way he is facing his demons head on and affecting all those who work with him. Beautifully shot with camera angles that make you feel you are right in the thick of the action, this is not so much a film about food but more in the way it's prepared and presented. Having said that if cooking is not your thing don't be put off, not least because of the chance of looking at Bradley Cooper for a couple of hours, but there is a story to be told here and an interesting one. I did get a sense that creating a menu could be the most exciting thing in the world but I wouldn't want to work in his kitchen. I really enjoyed this film, made a refreshing change.",2015
7,"This film is a rather special genre-mix of classic Western themes and gory, insane B-movie horror elements. Films like the quite watchable The Burrowers (2008) and Dead Birds (2004) have mixed those ingredients before with some success, but while those two were undoubtedly B-movies, Bone Tomahawk never feels like your typical straight to VOD genre film.",2015
9,"Saw this in early 2016 on a DVD. Revisited it recently. I was waiting for a second viewing before writing a review about this good film. The plot - A suspicious stranger is shot in the leg n put into a lock up by the sheriff Kurt Russell. Unknown to the him n the townsfolk, the stranger n his dead partner has insulted a cannibalistic tribe. Later, the stranger, a deputy n a lady doctor who is nursing the wounded stranger r all abducted by the savage tribesmen. Now the sheriff goes on a rescue mission along with his backup deputy, Richard Jenkins, a gunslinger, Matthew Fox and a wounded Patrick Wilson, husband of the lady doc. Before going on this mission, they r all warned about the savage cannibalistic tribe. Fans of the western genre will definitely enjoy this slow burner. Mind you, this film is not at all boring. The dialogues r good, the character development is brilliant n the acting is top notch. The pacing of the film is well complemented with intelligent and witty humor and highly likable characters n a sense of brooding dread. The debutante director, Zahler did a terrific job considering the budget. Before diving into the brutality n shocking violent confrontation, the director effectively builds tension and suspense. He is also aided by some superb cinematography by Benji Bakshi. The director is heavily influenced by classics such as The Searchers n Hills have eyes. Fans of Burrowers, Dead birds, Ravenous, Grimm prairie tales, Ghost town- 1988, will definitely enjoy this.",2017
9,"This film is a great example of what Hollywood is sorely lacking these days: Originality! Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is slow burning western/horror flick that keeps building the suspense until the finale. It's not an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is loaded with action, but it has enough to keep your interest. It has more of a typical western feel to it in terms of character development. The dialogue is spot on for this genre. The acting is superb and plot is genuine. I think that it speaks volumes about the script given the fact that the actors signed on for minimum pay (that means they WANTED to be in this film for the script and plot). The gore is definitely there for the horror fans, although I would say that if you are seeking a lot of gore, you may be disappointed. It does have some that is pretty graphic. I definitely would not let children or even some teenagers watch this, its an adult movie. If you are a fan of westerns, I think you'll like it a lot. If you are a Kurt Russell fan, you will not be disappointed (this was his first western since Tombstone). Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox make an excellent supporting cast and demonstrate their acting skills well. This is a new cult classic!",2015

8,My Rating: 7.5/10 ,2015
8,"Bone Tomahawk is about a small group of cowboys who set out in search of a group of cannibals who have kidnapped some of their townspeople, including the wife of one of the rough riders. It may sound similar to a lot of other westerns in the sense that it's a rescue story, which is somewhat true in the beginning. The first half of the movie is a great character drama as it follows the group of four for a few day and nights as they travel to their destination. This is where some people might have a problem with the film and the pacing might become an issue. During this time, we get expanded knowledge about the men involved and I found it rather entertaining because the route to their destination is just as dangerous as the destination itself. Yes, the movie could have been trimmed down by about 10-12 minutes, but it wasn't too slow that I lost interest (like many others I have read did).",2015
7,I watched this film very tired the other night and found myself sitting up alert immediately !,2016
8,"My title says it all. No other words best to describe this movie other than to say that this is the best horror/western movie this year and i would venture to say that this movie probably has taken the cup for being the best this year. If you are a fan of horror or western movies then you should definitely check it out. Kurt Russel, Patrick Williams give strong performances. All the four main characters describe one simple notion throughout the movie. Russell--A town sheriff who would do anything to fulfill his duty as a town sheriff and bring the criminals to justice. Williams--A loving husband who would do anything to bring his love back even in the face of immense odds.",2015
10,"Bone Tomahawk may be classified as a ""western gore-horror"" - probably the first of its kind, although the superficial plot - four cowboys going on a quest against cannibal Native Americans - is entertaining and original enough, the film is much more than that. The casting is remarkable, especially with Kurt Russell and Matthew Fox; the costume design and the setting does not fall short than the casting. Yet, what makes this movie a critical success is the fusion between the characters and the carefully crafted dialogue. The clever dialogue goes hand in hand with the slow-paced story of the film and enables it to reach to the climax with the action-packed last twenty minutes. The amount of gore in the film is set just right, finding that thin line between over-exaggeration and incompetence. As both a huge horror and spaghetti western fan, I may say ""Bone Tomahawk"" is one of the most original horror films I've ever seen; Zahler needs to get right back at shooting films!",2017
9,"BOME TOMAHAWK is a really good western/horror movie that features exemplary direction from an unknown director and great performances from the small cast. It terms of plot it's nothing special, a 19th century reworking of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, but it's the execution that makes this such a great movie. Despite a two and a quarter hour running time the film is hugely suspenseful and soaked in a gritty, disturbing atmosphere.",2017
9,"I had added this a while ago to my list but had put it off until a friend recommended I watch it so I pushed it up my list. Think Western Revenge/Rescue posse meets Cannibal Holocaust. It starts off a little slow and stilted, feeling almost play-like in it's manner of delivery and at first I was like oh no, this isn't going to be too good. But then the story ramps up and Kurt Russel enters the film and from that point on there is nothing dull or under-delivered. The violence starts off a little over the top but more hinted at or slightly shown, but by the last 3rd it is insane, cringing, screaming out kind of violence while never loosing site of the story, it's characters or the pacing. Nothing breaks you out of the film either, no moment was so far out there you went yeah right. This is a film done very, very well.",2017
8,"I was very excited to watch this movie on the back of the trailer, and particularly because I've almost always enjoyed anything Kurt Russell has been in. I wasn't disappointed. Bone Tomohawk is a movie that has been vastly ignored and underrated for it's originality and quality. The acting performances are very good, and although it fulfills at times the clichés of a western it showcases an originality to the genre that is extremely welcome. For me, perhaps biased, Kurt Russell is the outstanding performer. His portrayal is terse and unflinching. The surprise in this movie is Matthew Fox. His performance is offbeat, slightly creepy and somewhat intriguing. In this movie the western genre is mixed with horror - to fantastic effect. It is otherworldly action that exists outside of the norm and is all the richer for it. There is plenty of action, and plenty of comforting camaraderie. The horror is an added bonus that gives this movie a unique feel. One that I have no doubt will be replicated in future.",2016

1,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was a huge miss. These are some good actors and the movie has an interesting premise, but man oh man was that script bad. The dialogue is just so out of place and sterile that it had me cringing half the time and laughing the rest. I prefer a horror/thriller film to have a solid story, time to form characters, and a nice build to the climax, but the pace of this movie is all wrong. If you're going to spend so much time on conversations and so little time on action, there better be some progressing interest in the characters and a sense of involvement in the story. That just wasn't present with this film, despite the fact that well over half of it is spent in aimless talking and walking. The actors were held back by terrible writing and poor character development throughout the story, leaving us with sub-par acting and uninteresting characters. The general lack of a soundtrack contributes to the overall dullness and sterility of this film. As for scares, there really weren't any, although I will give points for the horror factor with those cave scenes towards the end (shivered and cringed during that stuff). Overall a solid idea with some great actors that just went straight to hell due to the awful writing, particularly the dialogue. Like I said, I really wanted to like this one and stuck with it even after the first 20 minutes made me realize how bad the writing was. But if you just have to find out like I did and find yourself doubting 20 minutes in, trust me, it doesn't get better and it's not worth waiting till the end.",2015

10,"this show is the cherry on top of my weekend after a long week. Absolutely love the over the top writing. Sometimes there is a need to escape the reality of carpools,sports,bedtime stories etc and consume yourself with some good ""not so"" old fashioned fun. With so much violence and negative/repetitive 24/7 news, this show is refreshing. Too much political correctness these days. Hoping for a season 2 with just as much scandalous antics and drug and sex fueled episodes that are far from the royal reality. My four children know that mom is not to be interrupted for one hour on Sunday evenings. At the end of the show I come back to the real world and kiss my children goodnight. If The Royals does not get picked up for a second season, well, FML. ha",2015

9,"As Canadians, we love to hate the British monarch. I've watched 2 episodes of The Royals and found the writing to be brilliant. Yes, it's a cheesy, campy satire that pokes fun of everything we hate about the monarchy which makes the show loads of fun. So far, the show 'captures' all of the gossip, innuendos and life events of the real royals. My mother was a devout royal watcher so I'm aware of the similarities between the show and the real royal family. If you weren't so aware of these events/gossip, the show wouldn't have as much meaning. The actors are spot on to their ''real life' counterparts AND I can't believe they found an actress to play Eliz. Hurley's daughter who looks exactly like her! I'm holding out giving the show 9 stars as I wait and see if they can keep going with the brilliant writing (they certainly have enough 'real life' royal debauchery situations to write about).",2015
7,It's kind of painful to watch with the pop music underscore. I wonder if it's more painful to watch for a British citizen or an American? I wouldn't write it off just yet. There are some subtle actions and dialog that make it interesting. Can people be so on/off with their feelings and behavior? How can I get ten lines out of this? Of course the settings are beautiful. Almost there. I wonder if the writers will handle the question of funding the ongoing Royal lifestyle versus the private wealth that they hold. All sorts of other interesting aristocrats to add to the mix. Can they make the commoners interesting? They can also handle royal privilege versus duty versus common privilege and duty.,2015

8,"Been watching this new series the very first one ever made for the E! network and I must say ""The Royals"" does deliver! True this probably is not how the typical royal family acts in England, but still this series is feel good feel free fun! The series no matter how good is fiction and it has plenty of family drama as it follows the times of this British royal family not just thru London, but thru the world of their travels! And even though this family tries to keep tradition they have plenty of their own vices from heavy drinking to having a lot of sex! True keeping the price of fame is a royal job all together while facing public scrutiny! Anyway the real eye candy treat is seeing the still hot and beautiful Elizabeth Hurley play the cougar type Queen Helena! Mrs. Hurley anytime I see her it's such an eye candy treat as she is the wings and shoulders of this series! So check out ""The Royals"" it's a feel good time and it's good to see Mrs. Elizabeth in a series.",2015

1,"Badly acted and scripted! Being a big fan of the heyday series of Dynasty and Dallas I was so looking forward to this shows premiere, however with each passing series moment, it became more painful and nauseating to watch. The acting and writing were down right amateurish, pathetic and corny! Seriously the show seemed like a parody skit that you would watch on Saturday Night Live. From Elizabeth Hurley's ridiculous portrayal of the cold as steel, inhuman queen, to the sleazy diabolical jealous Kings brother, then you have the party crazed, drug/sex addicted princess and let's not forget the ugly red headed stupid useless sister cousins and the token American commoner of the kings right hand employee who is of course sleeping with the kings younger son. Seriously the entire show was so badly acted and written I can't imagine who E hired to write this show? Absolute Garbage!",2015
6,"This show reminds me of a show that was on a few years ago called Footballer's Wives because there's lots of bitchiness, the characters are very rich, there's a lot of glitz and glamour, it's very sexy and debauched and there's lots of getting drunk, taking drugs and scheming. It's funny at times and I just cannot take it seriously! It's very very British, obviously, being about a 'pretend' British monarchy. It's ridiculous and as I was watching I was thinking none of this would ever happen. It's complete and utter trash but I just couldn't stop watching! So basically pretty much exactly how I felt about Footballer's Wives at the time it was out, but it was dangerously addictive and so is The Royals! You just have to keep watching to find out what crazy stuff is going to happen next! It's ultimate guilty pleasure viewing, I don't think you're supposed to take it seriously because the show itself doesn't take itself seriously either! Well that's what Footballer's Wives was like anyway and The Royals seems to be similar too in that way. The acting is pretty dire especially Elizabeth Hurley, awful!",2015

3,"It was pretty scarring to see my childhood crush, High King Peter, from the Chronicles of Narnia, as a promiscuous party boy. However, even his beautiful face and class couldn't make this show rise above trash. It blended together everything wrong with ""reality"" television and slapped a British accent and a crown. Further, it threw an American commoner into the mix, who was just bland enough and had just enough American brashness that all female American viewers will see themselves in her-- thus, seeing themselves with a prince and a future crown. It's pandering to the American female's Cinderella dream while mixing in some Jersey Shore nonsense. 3 out of 10. The only reason it wasn't lower is because of the moderately talented acting from Princess Eleanor, the king, and Prince Liam.",2015
3,The intriguing and handsome Vincent Regan and the absolutely gorgeous Blenheim Palace are the only two reasons to watch ...,2015
1,"I was excited to see this one. The entire season, the cast, the castle, everyone and everything seems to be missing the 'Royal' element. There's no grace. I get it, it's modern day, but take a hint from William and Kate maybe. ",2015
6,"The first three episodes are more like some mock dives before the original dive into the main story line. The base of the story line seems to be quite weak and there are many reasons behind. After the death of Prince Robert, the family seemed to be shattered but somehow recovered really fast to attend all the tea parties to mourn for the Prince. A Princess, a British royal, always finding a way to get high and drunk and showing her private part in public and embarrass the whole family, never felt like can happen in any royal family. A common security guard getting involved with the Princess and has the audacity to blackmail her to sleep with her seems impossible even in the wildest of dreams. The affection going on between a commoner and the young Prince didn't looked that arguable though. The most downside was the fight between the Queen and the Princess about holding a fashion show. No one in this world would ever think a Queen to rule the fashion world and to involve in a fight for the place to hold the fashion show with her daughter. The King (Vincent Regan) seemed to be more realistic about the death of the Prince though it seemed a bit odd that he was so easy going with all the workers around the palace. The lust of the King's younger brother for the throne was quite obvious, as we all see this common feature in all royal families. The makers tried to too much modernize the whole story. Elizabeth Harley was as sensual as always. Alexandra Park did quite a good job to give life to the Princess's character. She could have given a little bit more when it came to the scenes where she needed to be high, it seemed a clinch of over trying. Lets hope the story has something more interesting in the nest few episodes.",2015
5,"By the title of the summary you can guess I am pretty disappointed so far with the show. I just watched the ""Pilot"" episode and I just have one question to sum everything up. What kind of resume do you need in order for a network to go with your idea for a show? Apparently not a decent one. Mark Schwan's is probably a nice guy in person but the writing of this show is just so...everywhere. This show had all the makings of a hit. First original scripted show for a network that airs reality shows all the time, a strong female lead in Elizabeth Hurley (if you want to even call it a lead role because she is barely in the pilot). You could practically see the success coming out of the screen. After a couple seasons maybe a Golden Globe or too for a network that doesn't really do award shows like that. But none of that is going to happen with this show unless they get more writers or fire the ones they have now. It is just amazing to me how people all over the world, including myself, aspire to write, create and direct their own television shows and films but have to do so much to get our foot in the door and then when we see the product that was put in front of us from other writers who, from what I've seen barely done anything, it is a bunch of mess. The other woman that was credited for writing an episode, I wonder which one she wrote? I'm going to watch the second episode only because it's $1.99 if that tells you anything.",2015
9,"I love this drama!I feel OK with it,really!!British,you can't take some negative very serious,some people just want something to blame .I have no idea why so many people hate this series.But I really like Alexandra and her character.Alexandra gives Eleanor some vulnerability to make her a sexy hot bad ass.she can also be sentimental and restless naive.You know she is spunky and funny and sly,especially she is princess. God I love Eleanor so much!! By the way I don't think royal family dynamic with Liam ,Eleanor,Helena so well.If the show is based on that.....of course these other remained characters they bring into the fold, i think it's necessary to give more room to explore about characters' relationships. It's lots of stories to tell.",2015
7,"This might be for many a tough one to get into right out of the box. But once you wade through a couple-three episodes you know pretty much what you're getting yourself into... and it actually gets somewhat better as time goes by. And possibly by the end of S1, you just might find yourself surprisingly looking forward to S2. The casting job is top notch.. as are the performances of most all the actors. There is a flavor here for most everyone, and the ones worth looking at.. are really worth looking at (notably Poppy Corby-Tuech.. she's just absolutely gorgeous)! Is it well over the top.. undoubtedly.. and that's exactly the point. Actually, looking at what they are trying to accomplish is nowhere near easy.. and yet they pull the majority of it off pretty darn well. Doesn't always pay off, but sometimes hanging in there gives just reward.",2015
9,"I absolutely LOVE this show! I honestly thought it looked stupid, but I am so glad I starting watching it. It is one of my favorites now! Alexandra Park is SOO damn sexy and kicks ass playing the princess. She really makes the show for me. They could not have picked a better princess! The whole cast is phenomenal and they are all super attractive, which is a super plus for everyone. I have never seen a show with such beautiful women, I mean they are all gorgeous which even as a female I enjoy. is a lot more humorous than you would think. I never keep up with shows, but I never fail to watch this every Sunday. This show rules and I love it more and more every single episode.

1,"The show was funny for awhile. What got me was the relationship between Liam and Ophelia. They were the only couple with chemistry and there was an interesting dynamic there. Then Liam jets to NY and is talking to Ophelia in her apartment when that pencil-necked geek of a choreographer walks out of the bathroom in a towel. And that's how he finds out Ophelia is living with another man. That's just brutal. That borders on cruelty. She says she couldn't think of how to tell him. Sorry, wrong answer. Now she's gone from the show and since there's no longer a Liam/Ophelia romance, I'm gone too. Done watching",2017
1,"The title should be changed to Rags to Riches. The manner of speaking, behavior, just about everything is created to serve low IQ humans who will watch anything you show them. Save your time and don't watch this. There was nothing royal about then, it just seemed like a rich family being over dramatic.",2017
10,"I must admit when i saw the first episode i was thinking to stop watching because it seams to me like some terribly show whit all this first page sex scandals, princes whit drug addiction, prince who sleep whit employee. But i give a second chance, and i was surprise that i actually love this show. I love all the drama that it going on there. I love the characters especial Prince Liam , Jasper, The King Simon. Some may say that this is an waste of time show, whit no story, but i can assure you that there is a story, about love (between Jasper and Eleanor),about family (between Liam and Eleanor), about power (between Cyrus and Helena), and about honesty no matter what ( King Simon ) . It is a nice show , whit a good story, good actress, and a message to chose love every time , because the power will just destroy us . So this is why i love this show and i'm looking forward for new episode and a new season i hope . Enjoy",2017
9,"I'm not understanding the hate this show is getting. I get that the show probably didn't go where a lot of people thought it would, being a sort of continuation of the 2011 movie ""Limitless"" but honestly, the way people seem to think it should of gone is boring in my opinion. Every show out there seems to be full of heavy content and really dark, and this show, while still having some heavy themes, is like watching the show equivalent of a rainbow. And I love that! It's light, it's funny, it's well-cast (despite what people say about the lead, who, IMO, is the best part of the show) and it doesn't need to go in a darker, more intricate direction. I mean, also consider that as I write this, the season is only half done, and there's plenty time for more political intrigue or whatever people seem to think this show is lacking. But in my opinion it's a good show as it is now: it's refreshing. It's similar to a cop show, but it is unique because it's not about a cop, it's about a guy effectively functioning as a human Guinea pig for cops. It's a different perspective. It's about how his job, and the drug, affect his life.",2015
9,"I showed up pretty late.. I didn't even know there was a TV series until I was curious one night and looked up ""Real Life NZT"" I didn't find anything.. but I found out CBS has a t.v series for the actual movie.",2015
10,"Limitless is a show based on a movie of the same name. They both live in the same universe in which a pill called NZT-48 unlocks the full potential of a subjects mind. This show manages to make interesting characters and plots, without losing the main idea of the show. The best part about this show, has to be the protagonist, Bryan Finch, played by Jake McDorman. The protagonist has a way of looking at things and portraying them to the audience that gives us some comedy relief that the movie didn't really have. That's also one of the strongest parts of the series, the comedy. I didn't really think this series was going to make me laugh or smile at how the character looks at things. And to make the series even better, they made an episode that was a total homage to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. ",2015
10,"I don't get all these bad reviews. Anyways, I loved it. Jake McDorman I liked seeing on screen again, I remember watching him in Greek, a show I loved to watch. Jennifer Carpenter brings back all the fond memories I had of watching Dexter. Bradley Cooper, the Academy Award winning actor who stared in the original Limitless movie, come on! what more could you ask for in an acting cast?",2015
5,"I really liked the Limitless movie, both the idea and the acting was good. But this series is another ""consultant detective"" garbage. It started as a continuance of limitless movie but suddenly ( very illogically ) they involve cops and it becomes another case solving genius story. ",2015
10,"As title says, this show was off to your average TV show, with plain plot, an average cast and you know, all other things that we had seen by now. To plot was center around NZT drug and one propagandist, while efficiently ignored other characters, their side of story.",2015
5,I've seen the first two episodes - with the second being an utter waste of time since it unfolded exactly the way you'd expect - and that's enough for me.,2015

10,Great series! McDorman makes it very funny and pleasant to watch. Rest of the casting is very well done too. It is not deep but wasn't be meant to be like that.,2015
1,"I had such a high expectations from this show and hoping it would be beyond expectations; unfortunately the original idea became a victim of another brainless imagination and writing. First of all it is profoundly stupid to turn it into another cop drama... To top that stupidity off, showing that cops come up with an idea to keep feeding the lead with ""the pill"" to give his brain superhuman abilities and exploit him to use to solve crimes. Do I need to explain the idiocy of the concept here?",2015
2,"Many of us looked at this show from the ""Smartest man on Earth"" perspective: a person with the potential to do anything, so long as he could think a way of doing it.",2015
2,"Limitless the series picks up somewhere around the film Limitless has ended. However while the main character of the film, Eddie Morra, is an intelligent guy who just needed a little guidance in his life (which NZT offered), the main character of the TV show, Brian Finch, is a complete self entitled man child. Which is funny the first 5 episodes. But after all the novelty wears off, he just becomes a completely annoying character.",2016
6,"The show began with a promising pilot, it seemed as if it will be a proper continuation for the movie. It showed everything that we liked in the movie: a guy that was lost, not being able to move forward with his life, then a sudden gift - a pill that allows him to achieve the full potential of his brain, twist with killed friend and FBI trying to pin the murder on him. All of it seemed promising and interesting, continuing the concept of the limitless movie. However, with the second episode it is already visible that the show takes a sudden turnabout where it becomes just another cop show with a genius solving crime. This review is not meant to insult the show, however the show does not really implement the idea of the NTZ effect, it just becomes a crime solving show and it is a huge letdown after a promising pilot. For someone who is searching just for another crime show, this will probably be interesting and fun, but for those expecting part 2 of the limitless movie, I recommend not watching it as you will most probably be disappointed, especially after the first episode that showed potential only leading to a much greater letdown in the coming episodes.",2015
7,I remember the movie was a bit irritating. But a series is different. It's potentially interesting to see a high functioning brain as a super power. The premise does have quite a lot of stories that can spring from this idea for future episodes.,2015

5,"I enjoyed the film as it was well cast, written and had a good storyline.",2016
1,Hey - it's a show about a guy that can use all of his brain.,2015
1,"I fail to understand the writers in and of this series. The first thing any thinking man does when granted three wishes, is to request endless wishes. Well, I would kinda assume this guy is supposed to be a thinking man, given that is what the ""special power"" is supposed to be. So the ""fatal flaw"" in this series is why the guy doesn't do the first 3 things anybody else would do in his situation - especially given the ""special power"".",2015
2,"This show had very high potential, based on the trailers that I saw for the show, and the fact that the movie was pretty good as well. The pilot episode was moderately decent. I did like how they continued from the movie's plot, and even threw in a cameo from Bradley Cooper. ",2015
7,"This was perhaps one of the most enjoyable premieres that have been viewed this week, perhaps this month even.",2015
4,"I want to like this, I really like the concept (never saw the movie of the same name that other people here keep referring to), but the main character himself keeps putting me off. He's surrounded by a lot of talent but it is not enough to keep my interest when so much of the show depends on him. I don't know if it's the director or the actor, but it's not working as far as I'm concerned. I find the character annoying, a boring dufous and quite lacking in the subtle charm needed to pull off the balance this character needs. Wrong actor to to make this work, not sure why he was chosen. If they were looking to make another magical man-child vs the world ""Chuck"" type of ensemble, they failed. Next.",2015
2,"I liked the show at first but after the third episode I'm out. The main character is way too exuberant and attracts far too much attention to himself. He has an obnoxious desire to shine all the time which really makes him an ass. Such a disappointment. Could they improve the pill to make him more believable? Even Cinderella had enough sense to get out of Prince Charming's castle before midnight. Doesn't he realize that when midnight comes, he'll be is old self again? Imagine what a good actor, someone like Patrick McGoohan in his younger years, could have done with that role. There must be an actor out there who could have done better. The writing could be better as well but you can go so far within the concept of the show. I didn't see the movie so I can't use it as a comparison. That said, the TV show should stand on it's own and clearly fails. Jennifer Carpenter is wasted. Then again they're all wasted.",2015
8,"It's such a relief to see Brit playing the lead character rather than the clichéd ""bad guy"". I, for one, was never convinced by the idea that the universe would somehow be exclusively populated by Californians.",2015
8,"First, a response to one review which said:""The story was happening in some remote Galaxy, but strangely enough, there is only human in that galaxy."" No, not a galaxy far,far away. A star system reasonably close to Earth, in this galaxy. The first thing that a sci-fi fan needs to get straight is the real astronomy involved. As soon as they start talking about galaxies, you can usually just move on. This series appears to postulate a future in which FTL drive has enabled humans from Earth to move out into the spiral arm of this galaxy, and settle on various planets. While the astronomy of habitable worlds as satellites of a gas giant is stretching it a bit, it works well enough for our purposes. This scenario also appears to be lacking in aliens, indicating that none have (yet) to be encountered. But the real fun is the way that our little crew gets out there and has real adventures. I expect that more background and backfill will add some depth. The griping about poor acting, shallowness and general lack of grand drama is not appropriate to this kind of show. In fact, it's a pleasure to be spared the Grand Themes that plague so much sci-fi on the tube. I am hoping that maybe this show will turn out to be happening in the same universe as Dark Matter, and that our Killjoys get a warrant to go after the Dark matter 6. Whee!",2015
8,"This is a very fun, campy space western. It pulls off quite a bit for a low budget, the sets each week do feel genuine- unlike some other shows, every episode doesn't seem to take place in a warehouse or mall. The world building can, at times, seem to take over the character building, although seven episodes in they seem to have struck a happy balance. It's nice to see a variety of female characters who feel dynamic and have power, which is all too often something reserved only for the male characters.",2015

7,"Killjoys is a sci-fi show about two mercenaries who work for a reclamation agency. Their tasks include capturing high priority target and possible termination for some. The show has a mild quality, offering a bit of humor and good chemistry between the leads. It looks respectably nice, the setting is decorated aptly for its multitude areas such as the slums, high end manor and spaceship interiors. While it mostly follows grayish futuristic tone, it sometimes produces vivid setting and costume which make the visual more appealing.",2015
5,"Killjoys has a catchy title, good sets and props but sadly, like so many drama's these days, at its heart, its exposition driven. That's fine if you like your sci fi lightweight and action focused. ",2015
2,"This is Sci-Fi Jim, But not as we know it.",2015
8,"The one thing I liked the most is that it has some mature dialogs, they feel more real, especially the ones with Aaron Ashmore. Not sure if it's just good writing or if the credit goes to the actors, but they sure do a good job at making us ignore the whole studio- like atmosphere and the somewhat-hard-to-follow greater plot.",2015
1,"This programme will kill any joy you might have been expecting, especially if you are a sci fi fan. It contains every cliché and storyline you can imagine, attempts a poor imitation of Blade Runner's city scenes and the acting is just wooden from start to finish. The only thing that would make this worse is casting Steven Segal and Sly Stallone as leading parts. A good sci fi storyline will normally have something unpredictable and quirky about it. That's why this is not a good sci fi storyline. Start it up, go and make a cup of tea and a few phone calls, come back and see if you have to urge to rewind.",2015

The acting is top notch, the cgi is superb, the story lines believable and enjoying, spooky sometimes! And they release just the right amount of info for background story reasons every episode! You can't help,but love the show! We need more characters like Dutch out there, a beautiful, kick ass, yet vulnerable woman, LEAD ROLE!!!! She's NO ONES side kick!!!! She even has men as HER sidekicks, it's awesome! And her backstory, who is she, who is Khylen, what has she done, what has he done, will,bite her in the butt, will it bite Johnny? And Dutch and Johnnys relationship is so pure, light, loving, and amazing!!!!! Such love and devotion they have it's truly amazing...",2015
8,"i think this series has a ton of potential first parts was very good and it can become a cult like the Firefly, this movie is in the same line but instead of smugglers crew is made of bounty hunters and it seems they all have their dark past. i can honestly recommend this to any sci-fi lover it is now down to the writers to make this into hit, not making a lazy scripts to put of the punters like me, i was hooked from the get go. watch and decide yourselves i am hardly wrong in my predictions i say if the stories get better with some action this will be a hit series and hopefully they will not cancel this one like they did with Firefly, we the sci-fi lovers in need of a good series.",2015
1,"I started to DVR this series but quickly canceled it. Hanna John-Kamen is probably one of the worst cast characters I can remember. There is not a single thing about her that makes her the right person for this role. I would actually fast forward whenever she would appear. They all look like little kids running around with toy guns. When the SyfiChannel did the very successful Stargate series and the first follow on series of Atlantis, they did it right. Decent plots and great characters who you could actually care about. When they did Stargate Universe, they broke the mold and it has been downward ever since. Does anyone really care about any of the characters in Killjoys? Cancel this show!",2015
4,"A well done pilot - Again with more cookie-cutter actors and script-writing than Firefly, but the two leads in particular do have charm and likeableness, thank goodness! I am reluctant to diss Dark Matter because I hold medium-to-high hopes for it's future, but Killjoys is immediately recognisable as a superior show. It appears Killjoys have a significantly larger budget which helps! For me, I am just happy that we are getting more Sci Fi on TV lately instead of a never-ending parade of samey-samey gritty crime dramas - for me too much science fiction is never enough! Generally good ideas, a couple of 'blah' bits, a fair amount of predictability, but a good building of tension using the 'race-against-time' plot device, also, the lead woman is utterly gorgeous and the lead guy is the type of guy you'd like to hang out at the pub with - so, to summarise, it is a two big fat thumbs up from me and my innate Sci Fi bias! ADDITIONAL: OK sad to say I have returned to my review to report that I have given up on this series. It has had moments of brilliance here and there, but seems to be floundering more recently. Perhaps there has been a change in the writing staff? I once thought this show would prove to be better than Dark Matter, but now DM is improving while this one has become boringly unwatchable. There; someone had to say it.",2015
8,I love Scfy to this show caught my attention. The premise is interesting and the characters are too. I am really intrigued by Dutch's past and I hope we see more of the mysterious man. Johnny is also an interesting character and he and Dutch play off every other well. I am kind of disappointed by D'Avin's character. I don't find him that interesting and he's gets in the way of the story between Dutch and Johnny. I hope they make him a little me interesting or really I don't know why they need him the show would be okay with just Johnny and Dutch. This does remind me a lot of Firefly; I hope people support it and it last a while.,2015
6,"Someone compared this show to Firefly. Well, I'd like to correct that mistake right here. The acting comes nowhere near the acting in Firefly. The only one acting within the boundaries of acceptable is the dude from The Following and I still like him much better in The Following. Special effects, especially the weapons fire, sucks the meatballs out of the sky! Watching this show is like watching Josh Whedon having a nightmare. The girl's poor fighting skills are barely masked by ""just in time cuts"" and/or stunt doubles. The older brother should keep his nostrils shut more often, it might help. Who knows...I'm all out of ideas on this one. I watched 4 episodes and still no trace of improvement. I wont waste anymore time on this and will try to find a good book to read or make coffee or whatever. Everything but this....",2015
5,"Average in every way, shape and form. This show follows every single science fiction cliché that you have seen over the last few years. It is the typical below average made for the SyFy channel show that makes you wonder how shows like Farscape and Firefly never made it big.",2015
5,"Killjoys is an Interesting new series, but not captivating enough. I found my self a bit lost, and a bit bored. What I do like, is the whole Space Bounty Hunter, concept which offers an interesting new twist to the Space and SyFy channels. The show offers a realistic look at the future with not many technological advances except for the space ships and centers in space. We can expect to see a lot more action sequences, (which was a nice beginning in the pilot) to occur throughout the show in new scenarios. As a Pilot (which some start off week) I hold hope that Killjoys will offer an interesting ride for viewers in the weeks to come!",2015
2,"This show's vision of the future: everyone shoots at each other with guns and women dress like whores. Wait, that's not very imaginative since every show on TV set at present times has exactly the same setting. Nothing much Sci-Fiey about this show at all. I miss about half of what Hannah's character says because no matter how hard I try, I just can't understand what she is saying at times. And that is the real killjoy. How can you enjoy a show when the lead character mumbles with an incomprehensible accent. Most of the stories don't make any sense. I guess the bounty hunter premise allows the writers to just go off in any direction they want. I can't imagine this show making it to a second season since it just isn't going any where. The Canadian machine needs to produce something exceptional and different, because all these shows out now are interchangeable messes.",2015
3,"What a pity . I love sci fi, so I have watched the entire first season trying to like this show, but I have failed. Aaron Ashmore is the only good actor, the other 2 are horrendously bad , especially the female lead ( can't remember her name, that's how forgettable this show is ) who is out of place and is terribly miscast. I don't know what demographic it is trying to appeal to. If true hard core sci fi fans like me, forget it, it is far too stupid and shallow. If teenagers who like drugs, loud terrible music, sex and relationship drama, then you are getting closer, but why bother disguising it as cheap sci fi ? Just go with Beverley Hills 90210 with more drugs and sex or whatever. There are a few good concepts where I thought the show might improve. Then the producers just kill it ( killjoys for sure ) with cheap, cheesy sentimentality that belongs to a Spielberg Hollywood drama . Hey, I thought this was Canadian, so I expected much less Hollywood , nauseating, overly done sentimentality. Thank god for Dark Matter, which is everything that Killjoys is not. In every way.",2016
2,"There is a certain recipe when you make a TV series, one of them is that the story should be simple. This has been achieved by the first episode of Killjoy.

1,"I like the show. It's not great, but there'room for growth. However, that background music or ambiance sound or what ever you want to call it is like finger nails on a blackboard. I stopped watching. I'll try one more episode.Since the number of lines & words is more important the content, here goes.The addition of the doctor is a nice element and she could be a good second tier character if the writers had any skills.here are so many story plots that you could build on, you could get 3, maybe4 years out of it. Instead, the latest episodes are focusing on sex instead of the science fiction. The writers have no imagination and I suspect no skills. The acting is not bad. & I suspect would get better if that had something to work with.",2015
10,"I was delighted with this show initially. I felt a tad derailed by Dutch getting shtuped by D'Avin almost immediately and their duplicitous attempts to conceal their extracurricular activities like a couple of slime-balls. Apparently neither Dutch nor D'Avin have any respect for the always descent John. Treason too strong a word? OK moving on... now we have the season winding down with Dutch declaring ""no matter where you are I will find you"" (repeat for emphasis). Basically, if there is a season two, will it be called The Dutch and D'Avin Show? Will John be washing their soiled bedding for a full season? The Dutch and D'Avin Show with a hugely irrelevant John. Although Lost Girl had a long run it wore itself out by season 2 with thin writing depending on a lesbian/straight love triangle for its longevity. It seems Michelle Lovretta needs this kind of tenemus to sustain interest. For me, admittedly, it didn't work for Lost Girl and she has totally lost me on this soap. Thank god for Dark Matter and hugely superior writing.",2015

Continuing from the storyline after the events of The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious 6, Dominic Toretto investigates the murder of his long-time friend Han. Han was a previous member of the Fast & Furious crew in the past few installments. Following the investigation, Toretto discovers that Deckard Shaw is targeting Dom and his crew. Deckard, played by Jason Statham, is seeking revenge for the condition of his brother Owen Shaw. Once again, Dom gathers the remaining members of his team (Brian, Tej, Roman and Letty) to take down Deckard. Throughout the movie, Deckard seems to always be a few steps ahead of Dom, interrupting the crew's plans to capture Deckard. Toretto encounters Mr. Nobody, a government official, and discusses with him the possibility of catching Deckard. Mr. Nobody is in a struggle with Somalian terrorist Jakonde to obtain the powerful computer program ""God's Eye"". Mr. Nobody asks for the help of Toretto and his team to steal the computer program, and in return, he will allow Toretto to use the program to locate Deckard. With action packed car chases and thrilling flight moments, it's a race of time for Dom and Deckard to have their final face-off and prove which of the two would come out of their fight alive.

I thought the editing crew did a really good job at taking scenes from the other movies to make it seem like Paul was there the whole time. The part of Ramsey was really good, she worked well with the other actors especially Vin. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. The plot twits were really good for me because I love movies that you can't tell what's going to happen. Such as Dom being married to Letty the whole time. I don't know if anybody was expecting that but I wasn't at all. In conclusion I like the movie and it would have to be one of my favorites out of the seven.",2015

And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,""It's never Goodbye"" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.",2015

10,I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.,2015
10,"So last night we finally watched the latest installment of the Fast Saga:Fast and Furious 7. In September 2013 Paul Walker died during the filming of ""Fast & Furious 7″ in a car accident. To honor him the film was completed with a modified script. The result is not only a furious action blockbusters, but also a worthy memorial to this deceased star. While Walker had already shot most of his scenes to complete the film, for the remaining parts Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody had been used in some scenes with CGI and body doubles. In the end the additional work and time spend on this was very well worth it. The fact that one of the main characters was killed during the shooting of this movie won't be noticed in the film until the very appropriate sentimental end.",2015
9,"I will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but Fast & Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of 2015. It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.",2015
9,"First of all I wanted to say that this is one of my all time favorite film. Though, it was pretty sad but I did enjoy it anyway. I love the connection they have between the cast in the film they are original and as if they are a real family. I've been such a big fan of the fast and furious series since the beginning and I'm glad that this is not the final one.",2015
10,These franchise had got me sense of speed in every aspects of life. And the starting film where Paul entered was a memory for life. After hearing his tragic death I was compelled to watch this movie. The last scene got me to tears when I re looked the old film clips of Paul's films.,2015
10,"Amazing tribute to Paul walker, And what a wonderful memory of him... the Movie still stands in my eyes.. Amazing, extraordinary.. Some movies only stand in our eyes and this movie is.. The whole cast is marvelous and each and every minute of the film was written well... Pin Diesel stands back for family.. Paul as his brother.. Superb Ending.. I liked it.. The best movie of the decade.. Paul is amazing to watch in the screen as a father , brother.. Gibson is in his comic sense and the air diving and the stunts are .. Whooah.. One Last Ride.. Jason Statham blocks Rock.. Paul Drives.. Michelle is amazing.. Samma.. The team has really made a great effect.. For Paul..",2015
10,"movie was awesome lots of packed action, and the hot girls were awesome wish i could date them and be together and do stuff with them, you know what i mean and the music was cool too loved it all, even know when me and my friend watched it on DVD, it kept stuffing up the part i saw were cool, and would watch it again all the way to the top,i hope they make a 8 one, because that would be cool to see it without Paul walker, let try it see how it goes i never seen any of the other ones but might think about seeing it, but really loved the movie to bits and am happy i saw it, i know one boy who loves this movie and that what made me want to see it, and now i have.",2015
10,"Well... well.. well..... Let's see Everyone knows how traumatic it was to lose an actor and a person like Paul Walker. Specially for the Fast & Furious team. It cannot be described in words or any other means. However the way this film has paid a tribute to him is something which every actor wants living or dead. Movie is simply awesome and there is no question about it. The reason simply being it was not complete when Paul was taken away from us and the story writer and director must have been in terrible agony then. But the way everything has been put together not a single soul can believe what they just saw after watching this movie. However I was reading comments and reviews from other users and I find it sad to see that people don't give importance to little but important things in a movie. For instance I was shocked to see Tony Jaa in this movie. There is a full on action sequence where he is literally making an Ong Bak 4 out of this movie but people didn't find time to write about him. I think he was simply awesome. The best thing about this movie is Jason who is simply a Pit Bull from UK, a live time bomb, the transporter who can transport you to hell in no time and a very dangerous Killer elite in one... So my recommendation to people would be, pay a tribute to Paul, go and watch this movie.... For Paul",2015
10,"Fantastic Movie. Nice direction. Paul's action was fabulous. Fans might just love his scenes. Tyrese Gibson looks like a joker in this film. Routine revenge story but its shown in a different way. Jason once again gave his best like a villain. Dialogues are really good. Cars!! The Upgraded ones. Music was just awesome. Last 5mins of the movie before the end credits, the scenes appear like they are dedicated to Paul. Really we miss Paul Walker.Ride out song and Go hard or go home songs are played with end credits.The last song Before end credits shown like Paul and Vin Diesel go for ride is something heart touching,you might feel to cry if you are a Paul Walker Fan.",2015
10,"The Fast Furious franchise has come a far way, and this particular movie is far the best one. It is packed full of action, comedy and amazing cars. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves fast furious. The movie follows Tokyo Drift so it would be a good idea to watch all the movies again before watching this one. The ending is great and overall i think the director and the actors have done a great job!! Tyrese Gibson is one heck of a funny actor, Vin Diesel has done a great job in his role, So has Jordana Brester, Dwayne Johnson, Ludicrous and Jason Statham in his great role as the antagonist in the film. Tje plot of the story is great. I was hoping for another movie of ff8 but however i think it was appropriate for the team to stop here as it would be quite disrespectful to make another one without Paul Walker.",2015
10,James Wan did a really good job. :),2015
10,"I went expecting big things from this movie, and unsurprisingly I was not surprised. This movie was everything that I was expecting. From cars, to guns, to strong female characters (I.E the beautiful and talented Michele Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey, amongst many others.) The guys were also great, with. Vin diesel, djimon Honsou and Jason statham (all actors I have liked watching in other films they have done.) Dwayne Johnson pulling out the big guns. I really would recommend this movie and I did appreciate the farewell they gave 'the late' Paul walker at the end of the film. I do think that he will be missed by so many who have watched his films. R.I.P Mr walker. Hoping their might be something else this great group of actors can do together in the future.",2015
10,"By far one of the best films I've ever watched, doesn't disappoint from the previous 6! Watched it last night for the first time and I was extremely impressed! I think if you're a fan of the previous films, this one definitely deserves to be watched. The storyline is easy to follow, full of amazing action shots(no spoilers). I for one seriously cannot wait until the release of the ones to come in future. Although I didn't watch it in cinema, I felt the full affect of the clarity of the characters, it was an amazing film, I cannot express it enough. Many people expect disappointment due to Paul Walker's death, yet they managed to take it into a consideration of a big part of the film which made me both cry and happy at the same time.",2015
3,"Much has been said about the talented lead performers, and they have done decent work in previous endeavors. However, not much can be done with a weak script and with overextended dialogue that doesn't substitute for quality.""Trainwreck"" deserves its title for it crashes early on and never recovers.",2015
4,"This movie is like a lot of similar type of movies; meaning movies that aims to challenge preconceived notions of ""what a lady should and should't be like"". It quickly becomes banal, predictable and irritating. There's no depth of character here, because you sort of get the gist of the jokes before they're halfway delivered. Having said that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good performances. Unfortunately Amy Schumer doesn't deliver that. I don't know why scriptwriters and directors hit the same creative pitfalls every time a movie like this is to be made. We get it: here's an urban girl with a modern outlook on life who does what she wants, sleeps with whom she wants and doesn't apologize for it, etc etc.. good, but then what? A movie needs more than just a cliché of a character, predictable jokes and bad acting.",2015
1,This is *not at all* the movie they're advertising.,2015
2,"I am not a fussy person when it comes to movies and I was irritated by this one within less than 20 minutes!! I found Amy Schumer's character pretty vulgar and crude...and not in a funny way. The first eight minutes of listening to her, really made me want to turn the movie off and it takes a lot for me to feel that way, kind of like nails down a chalkboard. She also portrays her character very superficially, which normally does not bother me too much, however when it's coupled with unnecessary cursing every 2 minutes, along with a vulgar tongue...it doesn't come across well. Vulgar is not funny, especially in women! It's trying too hard to try and be funny. Tilda Swinton's character was even worse, she was obnoxious and also vulgar, two very difficult qualities that make it hard to watch.",2015
5,"I really enjoy Amy's TV show and was expecting big things from this movie but ended up feeling I'd wasted my time watching it and it's off delivery leave a bad taste in the mouth. Was it that Amy just wasn't up to a feature length film or was it Judd Apatow's direction that made this not work. Where Amy's mischievous bad taste gender stereotype flipping gags work on her show, here they were missing the knowing nod. Amy fitted her self centered character's skin too well and at feature length you started to believe this was a real person and someone you wouldn't want to spend time with, even in a movie. Schummer was too ugly, and I don't mean that in a physical sense. Hader was good, as were most of the actors, apart from the product placement sports stars. It really started to drag in the last 3rd, possibly because it had nowhere to go, which is exactly where it ended up.",2015
1,"WTF Amy ? An avid fan for years, smart sassy & sexy stand-up with intelligent observations and real humour.",2015
3,"And what a trainwreck it is! I have actually watched a few episodes of 'Inside Amy Schumer', laughing a few times and sitting there confused for most times. I understand how hard it is for a stand-up comic to not only star in, but write a comedy that lasts at least 90 minutes. However, with all my understandings I just didn't like this film. Small parts of it were kind of funny, but the rest of it was like a mashup of ideas that were trying hard to come together.",2015
1,"No spoilers here, there's no plot to spoil and not big amazing scenes or reveals to discuss. Suffice to Trainwreck is a huge waste of time and talent. It should not have been such a bad film but it's beyond terrible. The humour is weak and practically every joke misses the mark. Lebron James is the best thing in the movie - he's the only saving grace. Judd Apatow needs to learn how to edit a comedy down to a short, sharp 1hr 30min as well. I shouldn't be sitting in a comedy wondering if I've missed a week of my life because it feels like the movie has gone on forever. I should have learnt my lesson after This is 40! I am sure fans of Amy Schumer will lap it up but if you're not one then steer clear.",2015
3,I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend and we were expecting a romantic comedy but what we saw did not have much romance or comedy.,2015
1,This film was so disappointing. I was ready to stomach what I perceive as Ms. Schumer's raunchy stand up which is basically all you have here. I am a huge fan of Mr. Hader but don't expect anything from him here. He plays a stand up guy there is none of his brilliance of character here. If you are a fan of Amy you might like it. Or if you are so inebriated or high you might not remember it. Unfortunately it's like a bad song in my head. I can't get it out. The title should have clued me in but I would have more fun watching an actual train wreck than I could tolerate this waste of time and money. Although I'm happy Ms. Schumer get's her screen debut I'm inclined to think it will be her last. Any character movie from Mr. Hader would have been far superior. This flick kind of leaves you regarding how you feel about dog poop. It happens but best to be scooped up and thrown away. I didn't even laugh.,2016
1,"""Trainwreck"", hmmm aptly titled for this hodgepodge, boring, juvenile mess masquerading as a millennial comedy. The two guilty culprits here are Judd Apatow - director and Amy Schumer writer, lead ""actor"" and Exec Producer. This movie reeks of infantile, telegraphed gutter/bathroom jokes that have made there presence in many other Hollywood flops from ancient history to those released and buried this year. The most prominent ""joke"" running through this rabid dog is that semi sexy and OK looking girls, old women and preteens can and will repeatedly use the F word. For what purpose? Shock value. C'mon morons the shock value and any humor saying F*** by any of the aforementioned females is long gone and is now nothing more than boring banter. Anybody else care to join me in a class action against Redbox to get our money back? Jesting of course. This film desperately and tragically attempts to make a silk purse out of Amy Schumers sows ear.",2015
1,"It's stunning how endlessly stupid movies can be. I've never been a big fan of Apatov, his kind of humor never left high school, but then comes this film along, and voila, he lowers the bar even more. ",2015
1,"I haven't logged on to IMDb in years, but after WASTING over two hours last night watching it and then being yelled at by people I watched it with because I mentioned it as a ""comedy"" choice, I was willing to reset my password so I could give it 1 lowly star. The whole thing felt like either a grad, or maybe grade school project, I haven't decided which. It was the same old story of someone used to being single, getting hooked up and falling for someone and then after a bump in the romantic road, getting back together. It felt like it was from 15 years ago. Amy can't act. The rest of the cast was a bunch of SNL-ers, who seem like they signed on because their show was on hiatus or sports celebrities who lumbered through their scenes. WHY oh WHY would this tired story be over 2 hours long? I sat there thinking of all the other things I could be doing. The scene with Matthew Broderick and Chris Everett. Why was that even there? Amy in a too short skirt in way too many scenes to remind the audience her character is sexy, I guess. The dialogue was like from an online screen writing class - University of Phoenix, comes to mind. Hader was a WOODEN LUNK. The boss was nothing else but shrill, like in a bad soap opera. All the sex jokes were the same you hear on Bravo! or USA or any cheesy network with serial reality shows. You'd feel so much better if you did yard work or went to the gym or read something or even changed the filter on your air conditioner than if you did none of those and watched this reminder of just how bad the movies, specifically comedies, have become.",2015
1,"I am completely honest and not exaggerating, this must be the worst film I've ever seen! It is a romantic comedy made of randomly patched clichés and some very cheap humor. There's no plot cohesion, and whatever happens in the movie lacks a development, it's there to be just a filler. The protagonist is a cynical woman who happens to be a very one- dimensional character too. I guess that's all about it. I was sure the movie must have been universally panned. And then I was stunned to realize the film holds a score of 6.8 in IMDb and 85% in Rotten Tomatoes. I didn't know anything about Amy Schumer so I Googled her and I understand now she is a successful stand-up comedian in USA. Could this be the reason why people liked the film? Or am I a hater?",2015
3,"Is Amy Schumer supposed to be funny? She IS sophomoric, juvenile, vulgar, and crass. Seems Schumer's character, ""Amy"", was only interested in the number of anonymous guys she could bed and how many times she could say the F word. At times it tried to be a romantic comedy other times it was just about how raw it could be and wandered aimlessly.",2015
5,"""Trainwreck"" has gotten really good reviews and I did laugh out loud while watching it but it went downhill fast and in the end I felt like I needed a shower. ""Trainwreck"" is about Amy (Amy Schumer), a narcissistic, abusive, alcoholic and drug addicted slut who meets nice guy Aaron (Bill Hader) who falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and Amy's life changes. ",2015
6,"I liked it, it's not like any other Rom-com i've seen before. It's obviously not a masterpiece but it does the job, it's entertaining, funny and different:",2015
2,"I was so glad to see the SNL cast were involved in this film including Pete Davison, Vanessa Bayer, Leslie Jones and Bill Hader. However I don't understand why they made this film longer because it really did get boring in some scenes.",2015
4,"Apart from the eternal cliché of ""love changes everything and family is sacred"", my main problem with this movie is the lead character. She is unbearable, you do not get why the Doctor loves her, you do not see anything good beneath the bad surface, she is unlikable. So at the end, her ""transformation"" doesn't convince you at all, not that you really care about it.",2015
8,"All the critics seem to be male, which I find interesting.",2015
1,"I must admit I had high hopes for this film. Having seen portions of Amy Schumer's show and other clips of her stand-up I thought this should be really good. Wrong all the way. The film starts with promise but rapidly goes down from there. How many ways can you make promiscuity funny....well too many. Very few things in this film were funny. It began to become uncomfortable and very repetitive. Ms Schumer is good in small doses, but is no Bullock or McCarthy. Towards the end it picks up just a very small amount but goes back into the toilet. All in all, I could have spent the 2 hours doing something more productive, such as contemplating my navel or cleaning the toilet. Oh well, the next film I see will, fingers crossed, be much better.",2015
3,I'm not going to say 1/10 because I did laugh at a few parts. I dragged my friends to see this because I had high hopes for Amy. The trailer seemed pretty funny and I love Bill Hader. That is one of my complaints. Bill Hader as the love interest?! I had to literally hide my eyes like I was in a scary movie whenever they made out or had sex. It was so gross. And what was up with all the serious plot lines?? I was expecting this hilarious movie and *spoiler* her dad dies. Honestly I feel like some of the jokes are overused. The whole I'm a woman and I'm a slut! I have sex with a lot of guys! I'm vulgar! I make fun of myself! Can girls come up with anything better? Not to mention the opening scene was cringe worthy. There were a lot of people in the theatre when I saw it and like no one was laughing. She needs to work on her acting or delivery. I was ready to leave literally after 45 minutes. She's not as funny as I expected. Oh and all the funny parts are basically in the trailer. I don't get why there are so many good user reviews. It makes me sad that my fellow Americans gave this a 9 or 10. It really was a trainwreck.,2015
5,I was looking forward to seeing this based on the trailer. I watch over 60 films a year so I am well aware that trailers can be deceiving. ,2015
9,For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue. Absolutely love this show. Visually rich and very nice attention to detail and character development. Great acting in general but no doubt props going to George Blagden as Louis XIV (who is also amazing in Viking another epic show) and Alexander Vlahos as Philippe (a very great character analysis). ,2015
9,Yet another fantastic TV-series that makes me want to learn more about history. I thank the creators of this for making me more curious about what really happened. Very beautiful and well acted.,2015
7,"Based on historic deeds about intrigue and power-fight in Louis XIV court . This costumer movie is partially based on real events and starts in 1667 , with 28-year-old all-powerful king of France, Louis XIV . It toplines two rising British stars , Georges Blagden (""Vikings"") in the role of Louis XIV and Alexander Vlahos in the role of Monsieur , the Sun King's enigmatic as well as gay brother whose couple is the scheming Chevalier , Evan Williams . His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history , he married Marie-Thérèse (Elisa Lasowski) and being son of Anne of Austria (Dominique Blanc) and Louis XIII (David Stanley) . It's developed in the court of Louis XIV who decides to build the greatest palace in the world - Versailles . This well-known monarch governed in domains where the sun never set ; as Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from the capital . We should have the same intelligence as this monarch and take advantage of the power of this story and of its marvellous renaissance background . He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and , by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles -formerly a hunting lodge belonging to Louis's father- , succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy , many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis's minority . However , his brother Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans (Alexander Vlahos) has for some time been relegated to a lesser role in the Court , due to the growing power of the King' most influential secretaries , Bontemps (Stuart Bowman) , Colbert (Steve Cumyn) and especially the security chief , the relentless executioner , Fabien Marchal (Tygh Runyan) . Meantime , the situation of France is threatened by Holland ruled under charismatic William of Orange (George Webster) , being the situation of Louis XIV extremely dangerous and delicate . In the meantime , Louis decides to construct a big palace at an inhospitable place , but drained Budget , affairs and political intrigues complicate things . Louis XIV is in constant conflict with his workers and those traitors who possesses privileged information can acquire immense fortunes . During Louis's reign , France was the leading European power and it fought three major wars : the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession . Then , a dark conspiracy and the harassing by William of Orange make Versailles an uncomfortable place .",2015

8,"This king was a showman, not an insecure philosopher, spectacularly controlling, not a bit shy. To him the only crime was to be a bore. You might start with a makeover of the look and let the acting follow. Please do a better job with the men's hair and costumes. This is France, not dowdy old England. Although I do like the Mark Farner '70s rock star chevelure imagined for the king (who is very well cast with a short actor), all portraits of him show a cloud of curls from cradle to grave (wigs, of course). The fabrics are couture, but too neutral. That little red bow tie over the white lace cravat would have been three times as wide and multiplied by seven, like a holiday bottle of cognac. (Again, look at the portraiture.) Conspicuously absent: the fabulous music of Marc Antoine Charpentier and Lully, the Paintings of Le Brun, Mignard and Le Moyne, the solid silver furniture that nearly bankrupt the nation. Look to the movie, Vatel, for better food and fete inspiration. Monsieur said it best when Louis chided him about the 50,000 ecus shoe note with: ""But you haven't seen the shoes!"" No, we haven't.",2016
8,"We do not expect historical accuracy from a series featuring French royalty. Rather, we expect opulence, much action and intrigue, with a fair amount of sex and decadence. Well, Versailles has that in spades, and not knowing much about the France of that period, I am taking much of it with a pinch of salt, but I think this is really good television.",2016
10,"What about the series? The acting is phenomenal on the parts of these two brothers, the king and prince, who play so well off of each other over sibling rivalry issues, lovers, power and the disdainful lusts and charades the king lays on his own brother, worst of all sleeping with his wife and sending to and fro throughout the project this was. i knew they worked o ae series to play him like a throw away pawn, we see how really conniving and devious this king really was...all very conceivable and convincing, as well as entertaining and full of decadence; often showing adjacent ways disgusting human race treated each other, then...sadly it hasn't changed much today? I don't now how true to fact this story is being told, but i did formal studies of the design aspects of Versailles as it was being built, during the old' college years...i wasn't aware, this was as big of a project as it was. The french were the first at Versailles to build one of the greatest aqueduct systems ""in the world"", and yet it only recently needed some rebuilding and deep repairs...that's how far ahead the French were ass it related to technology and civil engineering. The series shows the honesty of how messed up the use of power was back in the day...women are objects to be negotiate. i d also appreciate the honest dealings with the differences in how Europeans treat sexual nature, versus the USA! The rest of the supporting roles are many and well done, also. The costumes are right on, periodically speaking, and done very tastefully! Also, this series brings up issues we all face today...the rights for privacy our own personal sexual lives, the issues of govt versus small business and entrepreneur class getting what their worth, instead of paying for the royals lives, first and foremost, as if that is not one of the biggest issues of this last two decade, everywhere, as well as brings up social status and rights to be treated humanely, no matter who you are! the indignities women suffered, even in social status! I do really love the cinema photography. lots to delight! i don't know why the score is not better? The only other reviewer suggests ""baloney on English accents"" versus using French? Really? How many thousands of period pieces are done and almost all of them are in the British accent and topography, almost all the time...another ???do we care??? question? No, most assuredly, not. See this one...it's worth the time, and time does fly with this one!!! Enjoy!",2015
10,"A feast for the eyes and ears, without a doubt! A great and pleasant surprise. Excellent and promising players! A series that are worth seeing, tells the story of the French King Louis XIV known as the Sun King of the 17th century, a king, smart handler, subtle, and your affectionate relationship but complicated with his brother Philippe, his court of friends and enemies, the conspiracies and interests, their lovers and its unwavering decision to build the famous and beautiful Palace of Versailles. Not being a documentary on the life of the King, the main idea is there and very well written and represented, with scenarios, clothing and spectacular dialogs. Congratulations to all of you, to the team of Versailles. I look forward to season 2 :-)",2016
9,"I think the casting is superb. Add beautiful surroundings and great acting and add the story of Louis XIV and you will have a show that pulls you into the middle of life in Versailles. I know they took liberties with the story, and sexed it all up, but not in a bad way. There is no 21st century holier-than-thou attitude, which is nice. They did things differently back in the 1600's and here is a show that portrays some of that, without preaching. It is rare that audiences are given credit for having brains enough to form opinions of their own about the characters. Things in Versailles are not all black and white, good and bad--there are many, many shades of gray here. It takes a lot to be able to show all those shades, and I think Versailles succeeds admirably.",2017

8,"'Appearance is everything' (Louis XIV) Many have compared Versailles unfavourably with Wolf Hall. I found the latter turgid in the extreme, in plot, dialogue, character, action. Its whole ambiance was drab and dark and I was left thinking that there was no budget for anything but obscure interiors, whereas Versailles is like a glitter-ball, its many bright facets attracting my attention: its undeniably pretty cast, the sumptuous costumes, magnificent settings and the stunning, beautifully crafted opening credit sequence, which has deservedly won awards, with its perfect marriage of images, music, typeface (just the way the title comes together makes my heart beat a little faster) - every time it comes on I have to turn the volume up. Every time. Louis XIV is often shown being dressed by his entourage, occasionally seeming mesmerised by his own reflection. But the whole shebang is an essay in grandiloquence, worthy of Louis himself, with the first season reportedly costing £20 million.",2016

It is very raunchy, lots of sex scenes, and lots of gay sex scenes, shock horror.",2017
10,"Great and I mean great acting that is so good it is better than the reality of Louis XIV. People may complain about it being historically inaccurate but what they tried to do was take the most interesting parts of his reign and make them drama. They communicate basic accuracy in his motivations and in the atmosphere. They go a bit far at times in his personal role as to my knowledge he did not beat up anyone himself. Those who want to paint him as a liar should also note he was a genius in designing both Versailles and setting the trends in all European courts, even down to having a mistress. In his time even men who preferred their wives in Germany were forced to imitate him and maintain a mistress. He invented etiquette and put out cards with codes of behavior. He did all this to control his plotting aristocrats and keep them busy at Versailles spending money on clothes as it was the place to be.

8,"Early promise makes me come back. Some historical inaccuracies, as with all dramatizations of history, but very impressive overall. Acting is superb. The costumes are magnificent. Its cinematography awesome. Unfortunately, the plot direction is somewhat confused from the handful of episodes I have witnessed. I hope that it may be given more time to develop as it has many impressive elements already. The individuals are already set up for important plot lines and represent believable ambitions of their own. It makes me want to find out the factual history to keep up with this telling of it. I rate it a 8 but my true review hovers slightly lower, where my expectations have been set so high for drama and violence from shows like Game of Thrones.",2016
10,I have just finished the first Season of 10 episodes on Netflix.,2017
1,When we watch something about France maybe try too portray the French and not the Engwish.,2016
2,"The first episode did nothing to make me want to continue watching this series. The characters were paper-thin, the plot almost non-existent and the makers seemed to only be bothered about shock value. Too much attention was paid to the sex, nudity and violence and not nearly enough to making the viewer feel anything for any of the characters. Too often it was not obvious who was who, as the programme fell into the usual period drama trap of making all their characters look far too similar. Yes, great sets and filming but any series ultimately stands or falls on its characters, writing and acting; and unfortunately Versailles fails to deliver.",2016
1,"Few examples of scandalous inventions by the script writers of this series. In the first episode very religious queen Maria Theresa of Spain gives birth to a black child (!) - of course that never really happened. When she died king ""Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion"" (Wikipedia). The king (Louis XIV) is having a passionate sexual relationship with his brother's wife (history tells us slightly different story). The actress Lizzie Brocheré is a young girl (in the series maybe 20 years old) that wants to be a doctor and helps her father deliver the queen's child (absolutely impossible for a woman to be a doctor around 1660). In another scene a court woman says to another: ""Nice perfume"", the other replies: ""I never use one"". Versailles didn't have a single bathroom in those days which was the main reason why perfumes were invented! Strange but true. So such conversation was highly improbable... All this (and more) happens just in the 1st episode! Script writers of a historical serial should know better! Unwatchable!",2017
9,This period in history is my favorite to study. The European transition from Medieval to Renaissance is the foundation of modern mankind. It was the movement from religion to science. Cromwell had just successfully led a revolution against aristocratic rule in Britain. This had sent ripples through the consciousness of leaders across Europe and its colonies. ,2017
6,"The scenery, costumes, video production, writing and acting are all top notch with this TV series. Unfortunately though the movement of the story is handled in a very clumsy way that is often times insulting to watch, which in the end make it mediocre at best. Much like driving a classic Ferrari with the steering not working properly. It's a shame too because it could have been a wonderful ride.",2015
4,"The first series did well but it seems as long as the episodes unveil to us , no more spice , story , play , nor vigor or truth in the part of characters and the scenes are above a poor result. What is than wrong ? Nevertheless not the actors bear the failure but the producers. It lacks reality in plot , I am sure that the Sun King has done many more thinks that to lineup the women in his bed . What about his role in arts ? It would have been a great deal to analyze the Kings life in this respect. What about his life as a patron of science , architecture, liberal arts and so on ... Why All had to be SEX ? ",2016
1,"I watched the 1st episode of the much awaited ""Versailles"".. What a great subject matter and equally missed opportunity ?! Historically inaccurate yes but elementary royal etiquette ?! The king would never stand to greet his aide when he enters his room, not even for an ambassador, maybe for another fellow king. I even know that. (Or maybe they tried to portray a weak king?) First of all, he'd always be watched, never be allowed to run like he does in the mirror hall scene. In fact, the king would never even be alone during sex, not to mention to Queen who falls pregnant with the midget ( and it took me some time to understand what I just watched ) He'd always be dressed by noblemen NOT servants.. (it gets a bit better at the end though.) The death scene of the Queen mother in the beginning could have been a knock out, rich scene in itself; surrounded by aristocrats , clergy, bishops, courtiers etc where are the burning candles and incenses, she's the Queen of France for God's sake ! Instead she dies surrounded by the two sons.. The plot is paper thin full of clichés like the reference to the doctor woman ahead of her time not once but repeatedly.. The costumes are great so is the setting but how wrong can you go with Versailles itself as a filming location?! A few flat deliveries and wooden dialog but that may be subjective. Overall 1st episode for me was disappointing but there is hope it might improve. Ten out of ten for BBC hiring an all fresh faces cast. I can see they are trying to take a great historical moment and adapt it to a modern context, have seen it before, doesn't always work, it would have been better entertainment if they asked Donald Trump to jump out of a cake",2016
9,"""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" is a film that shouldn't be as uncommon as it is for American cinema. It's a seriously contemplative and revealing drama about a young woman lost and confused about her sexual identity upon committing one of society's most serious taboos and realizing that she liked it and might want to try it again. And again. And enough times to keep an audio diary of her thoughts and experiences about said act.",2015
10,"I saw the movie that at the New Directors/New Films film festival in New York in March 2015. I read Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel that the film was based on. Although I did enjoy the book, I did struggle with the characters and a lot of the things the characters were doing, but I couldn't wait to read it every night. I loved the way she told the story of a 15-year-old girl that has just started an affair with her mother's boyfriend in 1970's San Francisco.",2015
10,Love this film. I highly recommend it. Written/filmed/acted beautifully. Very human. Very funny.,2015
7,It's 1976 San Francisco. Fifteen year old Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley) is overjoyed at losing her virginity to her mother Charlotte (Kristen Wiig)'s boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård). They begin a secret affair. Minnie and her friend Kimmie Minter get into various adult situations. Her stepfather Pascal MacCorkill (Christopher Meloni) wants to stay in her and her sister Gretel's lives. She records tapes of her diary and draws inspired by cartoonist Aline Kominsky.,2016
5,"Being a grumpy old guy, I'm not at all the target audience for this film, so please bear that in mind when I tell you that I found this a fairly tedious coming-of-age movie. I admired aspects of it - in particular the performances of Bel Powley and Alexander Skarsgård - but I wasn't able to maintain my interest in the story.",2015
8,"Been hopelessly hooked, for the past several days now, to the captivating selection of 1970s pop that forms the music soundtrack of The Diary of a Teenage Girl. ",2016
8,"""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" is one film that's not worried about showing it's point even though it's supported by some artistic animation it proves that one young lady is serious about finding herself thru sexual discovery learning that life is about love and lust before you discover your true self. Set in mid 1970's San Francisco Bel Powley is Minnie a young teenage girl who starts an affair with her Mom Charlotte's(Kristen Wiig) boyfriend Monroe(Alexander Skarsgard). And the passion and intimate feel is hot and feel good as many scenes are provocative and blunt showing plenty of skin and breast of young Minnie. As this young lady is in a crazy home life world as mom Charlotte is a fired alcoholic lady who snorts drugs with Monroe on the west coast and California party scene. Thru it all this young lady Minnie learns about people, life and love yet most important she comes to peace thru herself with love and inspiration for art and people. Overall good film of fun, discovery and finding about one's self with a happy feel in the end.",2015
10,"The Diary of a Teenage Girl is a Robert Crumb comic come to life. You better believe that I loved this film. 2015 has given us a lot of films to talk about, but this one went completely under the radar, and it shouldn't have. This may be the best film of the year, and by far, one of the most provocative and fearless pieces in more than a year.",2016
8,"You don't have to be or remember being or know or parent a teenage girl to find yourself addressed by The Diary of a Teenage Girl. Its broader theme is the danger of power, especially the sexual license which the setting — San Francisco, 1976 — emblematizes. ",2015
3,"Review: I wasn't a big fan of this film! I found it quite boring and the storyline didn't go anywhere. The film is basically about Minnie (Bel Powley), who is sleeping with her mother's boyfriend, Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard), and finds it hard to deal with her personal insecurities. As she lost her virginity with Monroe, she starts to explore with sex whilst sneaking around with Monroe behind her mother, Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), back. Apart from that, there isn't much going on that I found that interesting! The acting is quite good and the 70's backdrop, in San Francisco, is done well but I personally didn't find the characters interesting. Minnie gets fed up with pursuing a relationship with Monroe after a while and Monroe feels guilty about sleeping with a teenager, while her mum just seems lost in a world of drugs and alcohol. For people of Minnie's age who are going through there teenage years, I can see the attraction for this movie but I lost interest after the first sexual act between Minnie and Monroe. The relationship between Minnie and her father, Pascal (Christopher Meloni), was quite interesting but the director chose to give most of the screen time to the Minnie, Monroe relationship, with Minnie narrating her feelings throughout the movie. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy it that much but I can see the appeal for other audiences. Disappointing!",2016
1,"What is a masterwork -- Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel hybrid -- that roundly condemns patriarchal privilege and the exploitation of young women and girls, here turns into a very careful take on a young's girl's exploration of her sexuality that is rote, unenlightening, devoid of any feeling, and ultimately uninteresting.",2016
5,I'm a little confused by the whole make up of this film.,2015
3,I can only assume that the really high rating is from people of a certain religion or race persuasion. I had to exit...I found it a bit of a contrived yawn fest...and as my title suggests...The humour people refer to was totally lost on me and probably more understood by and relative to those who perhaps like a bit of (the unutterable crap that is) Woody Allen.,2015
5,"""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" should be re-titled ""The Diary of a Ridiculously Lucky Teenage Girl, the Kind that Only Exists in the Movies"".",2016
8,"Love the character of Minnie. Her story I feel is something everyone can relate to. Not just for young girls, which is what I figured because of the title, but the title seems more about looking inside the thoughts of a young teenage girl whose sexual curiosity is answered by an inappropriate relationship with her mother's boyfriend, and since they are her thoughts she has no reason to hold back, and the movie portrays this beautifully. ",2015
8,"There's an irony in how Minnie claims she doesn't feel any different after losing her virginity - other than a more confident slo-mo strut - as it's merely the catalyst for a long journey rife with change and maturation. Teen sex dramas usually suffer from not being able to go all the way, especially if they want to infuse themselves with comedy instead of self-serious drama. The Diary of a Teenage Girl scrubs those limitations and goes deep into the rabbit hole. At first, its premise of a girl having an affair with her mother's boyfriend is unsettling and it's easy to grow concerned that these will not be sympathetic characters. However, writer/director Marielle Heller is keenly in tune with her characters and if they don't resonate now, they'll just resonate later. Even the boyfriend played by Alexander Skarsgard has his moment in the film's darkest hour.",2015
7,"Must-see?--shouldn't that mean it's relatable? This coming-of-age tale is well acted and well written but its core is applicable to no one I've ever known in my life, so I had the feeling of watching an alien species: the sort-of-caring but ultimately disengaged and self- destructive mother, her sexually desperate daughter, the moron/predator boyfriend of both. After appalling adventures and misadventures, the boyfriend is bounced and mom and daughter forgive one another just like that. I'm always suspicious of movies (like this one, like Dancing at Lughnasa and Mermaids) that end with women who have seen and done terrible things to each other end of joyously dancing to ecstatic music: it's the filmmaker's cop-out instead of a real resolution. The ex-husband is played by Christopher Meloni, whom I've seen only in Special Vic Unit and never cared for. Still, he's paid his dues and he's insulted here with nearly zero screen time in an essentially meaningless role. Too bad.",2015
6,"I watched this movie because the premise reminded me of a British film I'd seen, ""Fish Tank"". Maybe it was because of that high benchmark that I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Diary of a Teenage Girl"".",2016

7,I had no idea what to expect when I started watching this movie. It drew me in right away. ,2015
10,"Being a big fan of the original ""scream"" series ,I thought a TV series like the original would less likely attract me. But to my surprise this was really amazing ,of course there are some cliché moments but still it would give you the thrill of what's going to happen next.The main highlight of this TV series is the story, it clearly explains the motive of the killer which makes sense and there's a good mystery behind it.Added to that the bits of romance and friendship bond between the characters is too good. A coming to the cast,all the characters have acted very well especially Willa Fitzgerald really has been top notch.Another thing to be appreciated is that each and every episode is good and the story doesn't deviate with any unwanted segments. I would recommend any horror fan to watch this and trust me you will never get bored of this SCREAM",2016
7,"Amicably making a case for itself. As a TV series, Scream has the advantage of having infamous namesake and it does deliver the classic slasher gimmick, although its greatest attribute is its self- awareness. It realizes the obstacles, such as cliché high school setting and transition from movie to series, and rather than trying to gloss it over, Scream faces it head-on with smart quips in addition to the mandatory pool of blood. ",2016
9,"Well if I'm being honest, the idea of a TV series based on a 90's slasher trilogy (and Scream 4) didn't seem like a great idea when I first found out about it about a month ago. So I followed the build-up and got more and more excited as the time neared for the show's premiere. And it was worth it! Firstly; The show is different than the movies, but what did you expect? Yea, it got inspiration from the source material but it stands on it's own. Secondly; don't mind the clichés, they're meant to be there. Overall this is a fun comedy-horror/mystery with all the horror clichés in the book, you love to see someone die because they're stupid! Even the characters are clichés; There are the Jocks (popular douche bags), nerds (or in this case horror fans), and of course you have the virgins (or good girls). So have fun trying to guess who the killer is, I know I will.",2015
10,"If you aren't sure whether you should watch it... do yourself a favour and sit down and watch it! Like a lot of people, I was sceptical about how they were able to successfully complete this series. However, it is brilliant and has you gasping for more. It is well written and exceptionally directed. However, it would be nothing without its brilliantly cast Actors. Amongst its other amazing actors, Bex Taylor-Klaus is exceptional in playing a complex character. Hope we continue to see her on our screen!",2016
10,"I was a little bit worried in the beginning, but with all the videos and stuff they released I actually started liking it, it's different so, if you want to see a copy of Scream Movies, forget it. This is completely different, but in a good way, it's has a good sense of humor, which reminds me the Scream Movies, the mask it works, for me, and actually this show has a story behind, so the killer doesn't kill just for fun. It's funny how they try to ""blame"" some characters, so we can have our own theory.",2015
9,"Of course in this day and age, technology Youtube, and Facebook are going to be a big part of our new television show's plots, and I guess it's kind of a drag to see that.. Aside from that, this show is pretty juicy. ",2015
8,I recently began binge-watching Scream the series on Netflix a couple of days ago and became hooked straight away. I had seen the original Scream movie from 1996 and found the story-line to be clever and was intrigued to see how they could revamp the 90s cult film into a 2015 series and what the similarities between the characters would be with a modern twist.,2016
7,"WoW ,, i really didn't expect it to be that thrilling and full of mysteries,, well it is no where near the movie itself and yes there are some weirdly motionless quiescent moments MTV style like but gosh the craziness and the jumpy scenes are patching up any unnoticeable holes.",2015
1,"Dreadful TV series based on the ""Scream"" films. It takes the basic premise of the films (kids being stalked by a killer), throws in a new storyline with different characters and uninteresting twists. The show tries to show how clever it thinks it is by referencing old horror films and shoving social media in our face nonstop. The opening killing isn't scary or particularly well-done. It just made me remember how good and scary Drew Barrymore's one from the original was. The actors hired to play the ""kids"" are way obviously too old for high school. They're all good-looking but have zero acting ability. The worst is easily John Karna. His line readings were so awkward I didn't know how to take his character. He's talking about murderers and killings in a VERY annoying casual way. Worst of all the show wasn't interesting or the least bit scary. The nonstop commercials MTV kept inserting didn't help. I won't be tuning in for episode 2.",2015
1,"Coming from someone who saw the first scream and fell in love with it and the slasher genre at the age of six. This is trash,This is the worst acted worst dressed and worst haired TV show I've ever seen. Im only 26 now so my age has no bias. If this is what the teens think of as cool and edgy I am scared for this generations intelligence level. I really wanted to like this. Some advice kids stick to the original. No wonder Emma Roberts turned this down. I couldn't even finish this episode its that bad. Kevin Williamson must be pulling out his hair... the films are still better even though the original is 20 years old. The actors acting and direction are so much better and surprise actually scary.",2015
1,"For those of you out there who think this series is special, you're a moron. Like many other reviewers I failed to watch the entire episode. I'll ramble here, but basically in a nutshell...There isn't a single likable character on screen, as soon as someone opened their mouth I instantly wanted them dead. It tries to be post-modern with its you tube/smart phones, talking about how a slasher movie could never become a series, and ends up sounding like some twelve year old wrote the script in between watching episodes of Teenage Mom. Utter non-sense, utter trash. This isn't the 90's anymore so stop acting like it is. The show completely fails to hit the mark, on any level. And the main thing is it just isn't scary anymore, a man running around in a mask. It's overly clichéd, cheesy, and well, terrible. The writing seems to have been patched together by a group of people who know absolutely nothing about suspense, character development, dialogue or structure. I fail to understand how the producers at MTV thought that this was a good idea. It simply isn't. There is no realism, everyone walks around with their expensive phones in their ideal homes, dressed in clothes that are hip and trendy. Rubbish! And the way these American teenagers talk can best be described as the worst dialogue conceived for television. It's like someone is stalking people from Beverly Hills 90210. I couldn't care less. Crap. To top this bag of turd off you get a scene where a group of teenagers stand around and gasp at someone who has just come out as gay. Wow, just wow. Totally living in the 21st Century aren't we MTV. Honestly, this show made me want to punch the screen repeatedly. Television has come leaps and bounds in the last five to ten years and when shows like Hannibal get dropped for no reason what so-ever and this pile of toss gets commissioned, I really worry about the future of television. 0/10",2015
4,"I vowed not to review this until at least a few episodes in to give it a fair shot. I understand this was developed for the new MTV generation, but quite frankly, this show massively insults them. Unlike the popular film franchise which managed to cleverly poke fun at stereotypes, this series tries to legitimately pass them off in glaringly offensive ways. The girls either impossibly weak damsels in distress, or bitter, venomous sex objects written specifically for male entertainment. The only exception to this rule has been the refreshing character of Audrey. Aside from her, the jocks are trying to be alpha males and the girls are skimping around in lingerie and teasing them. It's definitely exploitation, and for anyone with a modicum of intelligence, disturbing as well. I place the blame for this solely in the writers laps. This is simply lazy development, relying on caricatures rather the giving us people who feel remotely real. Simply put; If we were smart enough in the 90's and early 2000's to mock these carbon copy characters with spoofs like Another Teen Movie and Scary Movie, why have we regressed into using them again with the expectation they'll be taken seriously?",2015
2,"... then they need to watch more than this channel for morons. This looks like it was filmed in the 80s as a bad syndicated TV show, for those to young to know what that is, think straight to DVD movie i.e. crap. I saw the first 8 minutes of the show as a preview and was really excited to see the show (except it really was just a rehash of the first movie's intro.). It looks like they spent all the money for the show on the first 8 minutes, and had to go cheap for the rest of the episode. Really guys, the lighting and filming looks like ""Small Wonder"" (god awful syndicated show from the 80s.) As for the actual writing, it is obvious that the writers are really worn out and need to stop re-treading the same boring themes. Get rid of the ""Randy"" character. OLD really old. Kevin Williamson- you are so burnt out, all you are doing is a bad repeat of your movies. Time to retire. Or at least put in some production values so that I can look past the terrible rewriting of Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3 etc etc.",2015

The story arcs are great and offer tons of questions and story.SUPPORT THIS INCREDIBLE SHOW NOW!!! With it having such a plethora of backstory and furture offerings, this show can easily go five seasons....as long as they evolve the locations and timeline. Of course move season 3to college. Four end of college/entering the world and final season 5 brining it home again and revealing the absolute truth that was driving most of the death and mayhem.",2016
1,"Where to start... Right from the beginning when they announced a TV show instead of a new movie, my heart sank deep. I've been begging and hoping for a fifth movie to conclude the Scream series once and for all, but 4 years after, the master himself has passed away and Bob Weinstein was a stubborn moron, who missed his chance to earn big money I love the Scream series, and I've been a huge fan, ever since I first watched the movies all the way back in 2008. I've watched most of Wes' movies, and he's by far my favorite horror director. Both ""Scream"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has made a huge impact on me, more so than any other horror series. But this ""show"" is just a giant middle finger to fans' faces everywhere, and a disgrace to the late Wes Craven.",2015
10,"This has been by far, one of my favorite TV shows ever. Not only for being a horror TV show, but for also making genuine justice for one of my favorite series of horror movies ever. The movies are a classic for fans, and for even having guts to pull something like that out already shows some hell of a courage. It contains everything that makes us love the movies, suspense, romance, well done bloody scenes, the ""Who the hell is the killer?"" doubt and the list goes on. Plus, they were able to connect good actors with well built character and some good demonstration of life with technology on nowadays. Can't wait for next season!",2015
2,"Let's get this out there first and foremost. Scream:The Series is a slave to a scenario that require very talented writers to navigate a ten episode run of twists and turns that can keep you scared, jumping, questioning who-done-it and ultimately caring about it all while tying it together in a cohesive package.",2015
6,"Like other viewers, I want to like this show. But it needs work. I am willing to give it a chance with a few more episodes before I call it quits. It may sound petty, but one of my pet peeves with the show is the way the high school students are portrayed. Drinking at will, absolutely no parental supervision, behaving more like adults than young adults. They act (and look) more like college students than high schoolers. So, why not simply have the characters be college age instead of something that is harder to accept. I like MTV's Finding Carter, but I have the same complaint for that show as well. It's a little easier to stomach though, because their is less storyline to take on faith in that series. I would like a little more realism for the characters age and behavior is all. But, it looks like that has already been decided. Too bad, a little innocence and naiveté would go a long way in making the characters and show more believable.",2015
1,"OK, what is MTV trying to say with this show? I guess it's that all American youths are superpretty, superjocky, superdumb and stuck in normative gender roles? Well if that's your thing, you struck gold! If you've already had a successful theme with chicks in swimsuits getting stabbed in a hot tub, why change a winning concept? It's not like that's a problem with todays violence and generalising against women! ",2015
10,"I am 15 years old. The first episode premiered tonight. I am giving it a ten for its strong start and confidence to follow the beloved movie series it hails from. I hope it keeps me unapologetic for my generosity. It's cool how they recognize how mediocre this kind of content is. Every is predictable. I hope they found solutions by making things unexpected. ""You can't do a slasher movie as a TV series."" I want it stretched it out but don't make it boring. What a great time to premiere though. While other shows are on weird scheduling and everyone has jumped on the Netflix ship. Here's a tip MTV: show episode reruns FREQUENTLY! People nowadays watch things only when they want or can. It's not about just catching attention but going VIRAL. Be AVAILABLE. Use YOUTUBE to promote. Fingers crossed. Sincerely, the youth teen demographic.",2015

10,"While I was hesitant to watch the show I am happy to admit I liked it. While it definitely does not compete with the high standards set by the films the show definitely takes everything in a new direction. A lot of people hate it because its not like the films but this is a new generation of slasher. We are less reliant on the good old style fun of the original and more reliant on scares technology has to offer. This is a show not to be taken to seriously and should be considered as good fun. The acting may seem a little weak at times and the scares are nowhere near as frightening as it could be but the basic premise is original, a mix of scream and other slasher classics. The show needs to be made scarier to compete with the films and earn over fans but if the show continues heading in this direction I'm sure more seasons will come. Just like how the films payed homage to cult classic slasher films the show acknowledges modern day horror shows e.g. bates motel, and adapts the fun horror rules and clichés of the original to a TV format. The action and scares will happen slower and less frequently but if the show relies on the tension and suspense of the original film we could be looking forward to a great first season. The characters are clichéd and rehashes of the original films but them and the plot are surely entertaining. The show definitely needs more suspense, longer victim chases and decent character development to the stereotype stock characters we have now. For fans of the original stop comparing the show to the film, while it obviously cannot compete with them it definitely has fun toying around the rules of the original series and manipulating certain elements so expect less 1996 and more 2015. I just hope the series has an amazing end of season twist for the killers revelation like with the original films, we wouldn't want anything boring and predictable.",2015
4,"I'm a huge fan of the Scream films so as soon as MTV announced that it was creating a Scream TV Series, I was in! I was pretty much expecting the show to be God awful but fortunately, it wasn't as bad as I anticipated. However, it was still bad. What we got was a show devoid of humor, scare, the tongue-in-cheek speech we've grown to know and love, and even character development. Kevin Williamson is absent from the project and his presence is sorely (and noticeably) missed. The back story was uninteresting; the new ""Ghostface"" mask, if it can even be called that, was frightening to look at (and not in the way they intended); and the characters were unbelievable (and this is coming from a 19 year old). However, I attentively watched the entire episode. Hopefully things will change in the coming weeks—I'll be sticking around to find out.",2015

Troy Aikman was the only one anyone talked about at this time regarding concussions and everyone thought he was fine. What they didn't talk about which this movie does a great job is pointing out all the players that died or had violent disruptive behavior due to post conclusion syndrome.

I will not play, coach, or watch it again until overall awareness and change is set in place for the affects of playing the game to be accounted for in some kind of way on a large scale. I have played this game for the last 20 years of my life and have physically felt the affects of it more and more each year. If you have played this game you know the ""SuperMan"" like culture that comes with it. How it is a sin to get hurt or say ""I have a headache"". I will no longer turn a blind eye to the long term affects of ignoring the phrase. What the normal fan or anyone who hasn't played the game at a high level doesn't know is the stress and depression that comes with leaving the game. I'd equate it to being the same as losing a spouse of 30+ years but add 100 blows to the head every day of each year. You already feel lost and meaningless but you also have years of brain damage which inflates the process. I grew up with a love for football because of its culture, all the great things it taught me, and the qualities it brought out of me and my ""brothers"", my teammates. BUT all of that is not worth my life after football. The fact of the matter is we as a society have turned a blind eye to the long term affects of playing football and I refuse to be a part of the problem any longer. This movie is not as visually gripping as it could have been and it also doesn't expand anywhere near as far as it could have on the obvious occurrence of brain injuries throughout every level of the sport but it gets right to the point and it shines light on the facts. The sport isn't going anywhere safe until the NFL does and the NFL has not and probably will not because of money. If change in the sport is going to occur it has to start at the top. After watching this movie every parent has to question if they want their child to participate in this sport. For me and my children, it's a definite ""No-Brainer"".",2015
8,"The film Concussion describes the incredible journey by Nigerian Dr. Bennet Omalu (wonderfully played by Will Smith) who uncovered a shocking revelation about the damaging effects football collisions have on its players. More specifically, players whom often went misdiagnosed (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). Dr. Omalu was the first to bring the issue of head-to-head collisions to light, addressing it as a very real problem in need of being fixed by the influential football organizations.",2015
10,"#Concussion has made me see what athletes go through from a different angle and I'm saying that as a man who didn't grow up a fan of American football. CONCUSSION is a compelling David Vs. Goliath story, it's a true great American story, and it's Will Smith's best performance since 2006's ""The Pursuit Of Happiness"" Written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the GQ article ""Game Brain,"" you've all seen the trailer for CONCUSSION which has Will Smith playing real life accomplished forensic neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, who discovered a disease called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which a progressive degenerative disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma, and it's commonly found nowadays in pro-football player because they get repeated bows to the head every time they play, this is a heavy contact sport, as we all know.",2015
10,"Just watched this movie and blew my mind. The acting, the story line, together with science and drama, were perfect. Very inspiring movie, since is based on true case. Truth always come true, it is just a mere of time and this movie shows that by telling us what it is to be a pioneer and a messenger of truth. This is a must-see movie.",2015
6,"Concussion is a biographical picture that takes place in the early 2000's. The movie starts out by showing these players who freak out and start getting dimentia. Will Smith is a pathologist who starts doing autopsies on these players and discovers that there is a common theme, being repeated head trauma to the brain. The NFL knew about what was going on, but didn't say anything. Will Smith tries to shine light on the situation but the NFL does what it can so that the story does not leak. ",2015
9,"If anyone is a die hard NFL fan like me and follows the game and the sports world and the news, you know that over the years the league has been facing the problem of how to deal with player concussions and how to protect them better, and what to do when the players retire. The film ""Concussion"" deals with that on going drama just fine as it follows the research and work of one real life pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu(played in a tough strong performance manner from Will Smith). Set in Pittsburgh after the deaths of several star former Steeler players most notable that being hall of fame center Mike Webster(in a gritty performance from David Morse)who due to many hits to the head developed all kinds of problems like hearing voices, and loss of reality as he even had to live away from his family taking shelter in his own truck before falling to suicide by a head gunshot wound. The film is somewhat sad and emotional as you see the broken down players and hear the stories of their problems and passing. Dr. Omalu is one pathologist who's eager and willing to find out more and why and what drove these former players to young deaths by suicide, so thru his work he finds brain damage in these former players who suffered concussions and all would develop a new disease CTE. At first his medical news is doubted by others doctor's(played well by Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks)yet they are slowly broken in to believe yet the challenge to face the NFL with the news is the toughest, as the film states you are going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week even over the church and of course that's Sunday as the NFL has risen to sports entertainment that's at the top of the mountain. Finally Dr. Omalu's voice and discovery does get the league's attention and many former players and current ones take the issue to capital hill and congress. Overall ""Concussion"" is one film that's an emotional drama of discovery and it searches for the truth wanting answers to a new NFL problem that has expanded.",2015
6,"Concussion isn't a bad movie - however, with the real-life implications of the story and subject matter this could have been a hard hitting dramatic tour de force.",2016
3,I have watched with interest the wave of change moving through the world after CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) was revealed to be occurring in young football players and not just boxers. A PBS doco from a few years ago was enlightening and described how the American football industry fought against the science. While this film tells the story more or less accurately (as I understand it) it does so in such a clichéd and insulting manner it is barely watchable. ,2016
9,"When you are going to make a film about a sensitive subject, the number one rule is you have to make sure its a dam good one! Peter Landsman i take my hat off to you as you have delivered a brilliant film in concussion, the story of Dr Bennett Omalu who uncovers the dark truth about brain injury sustained in American football and how Dr Bennett was persecuted and branded a liar by the NFL and its teams. It is a beautiful David vs goliath true story how a doctor will do whatever it takes for the truth he discovered the condition known as CTE to be taken seriously and to try save lives. Will Smith is inspirational and shows why he is one of the best actors around and when you have a supporting cast of Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks you have to be on top of your game and Will Smith nails it. I highly advise you to watch the gripping true story as not only will you learn something new but also have a new found respect for American football.",2015
5,"6 corporations control 90% of all media in the US. So, of course, the same people that made this movie are the same people that own sports teams and suppressed the truth about concussions. So, while they may have temporarily lost money due to the expose, they are making some of it back selling this tearjerker back to you! ",2015
3,"Concussion has to be the worst edited film I've ever seen. In the first scene, Will Smith's lines of dialogue cut awkwardly across each other just as the camera inexplicably jumps from different angles. Much of the story is very hard to follow, such as showing the death of one NFL player and then discussing another, not approaching the on-screen death until about 20 minutes later. The death of Mike Webster is very confusing, as it shows him tasering himself (which Webster used as his only method of achieving sleep) and then cuts to his body on the operating table, implying heavily that the taser caused his death and contradicting the entire movie. Not to mention that the 2 hour movie feels more like 3, courtesy of sluggish pacing and unnecessary scenes. The story would have been better off having Omalu and his wife already married at the start, allowing for almost 10 minutes to cut footage right there.",2016

5,"Will Smith delivers an Oscar worthy performance as crusading pathologist Dr. Dr. Bennet Omalu in ""Parkland"" writer & director Peter Landesman's ""Concussion,"" a mediocre but true-life medical expose about the perils of playing professional football. Although the timely subject matter about brain-damaged NFL players is definitely the stuff of which concussions are made, the straightforward saga lacks the devastating impact of its message. When you consider what the NFL has gotten away with in its greed, you'd think ""Concussion"" would have conjured up more clout. Little of what happens in ""Concussion"" is remotely compelling. Occasionally, ""Concussion"" conjures up suspense. Were it not for Smith's subdued presence, this anti-pigskin parade would never played movie theaters and quietly have passed away on home video. Landesman surrounds Smith with an impeccable cast, including Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, David Morse, Richard T. Jones, Eddie Marsan, and Arliss Howard. Landesman did a good job with his JFK thriller ""Parkland,"" but he drops the ball completely here.",2015
8,"I have to be honest. I haven't been a huge fan of Will Smith the actor. He always seems to be doing not much more than playing himself in his roles. Even in The Pursuit of Happiness it was hard for me to forget that the character I was watching was Will Smith instead of who it was suppose to be. This works well for him when he's doing comedy or action such as Men in Black or Bad Boys, but not so much when he's taking on something dramatic that requires a transformation into an actual role. (To be fair, I can't seem to remember ever watching Ali and I suppose I should do that.) ",2015
5,"'Concussion' is one of those movies that you watch once and never even think about again. It's a film that seems to stand solely on the principle of getting Will Smith an Oscar nomination. Because virtually nothing else in the film even compares to his dedication. Even writer/director Peter Landesman seems to not care about this film as much as Smith does. It's one of those films that you would call ""Oscar Bait"". A movie that has next to no substance aside from an all star actor acting their tail off. The other ""Oscar Bait"" film I saw this year was 'Black Mass'. It's unfortunate that this is becoming more and more popular these days. Each time I see one of these films I can't help but feel like we missed out on a superb story. A story that, in a talented directors hands, could be a legitimately good film. But I'm not saying that this film is terrible. It's not. It's more mediocre than anything. ",2015

3,"""Concussion"" is the cinematic equivalent of a stand-up who laughs at his own jokes. Each revelation, each tragedy, each teary-eyed silence is followed by either a line or a musical cue referencing what's already been well enough established. This malady is not unique to ""Concussion,"" but that doesn't make it okay.",2016
3,"Sony is the one Hollywood studio that doesn't have a mult-billion dollar contract with the NFL. This left some hope for the movie about a story the media, as business partners of the NFL, has refused to properly delve into, but there were frustrating signs all along that this wasn't going to be a serious movie about a very serious subject, and the results like the disease are upsetting. ",2015
10,"This film is an emotional poignant look at a subject that touches all America. Wow! 1st -let me saw that after Will in ""Ali"", I realize that he can really tap into real people. He can get there, transform and leave you speechless in his portrayals. He is a Master of the Craft and can reach in and touch the soul of the Source Reference while astounding you with minor characterizations (rubbing of his hands and the other "" oddities"" that make all is us human). He gets it. Humanity is humanity. He us the Epitome of Shakespeare's writing about Humanity. Will is no fore a Shakespearean Actor as Shakespeare's was a real Psychologist. Neither of them profess to be the latter thing but both get there and command our attention and demand our respect not because they are so talented (both are) but because they are both undeniably right.",2015
2,"There has been quite a spate of movies recently boasting of being based on events that really took place. Up comes the sentence during the opening credits: 'Based on a true story.' Spotlight, Black Mass, The Big Short, Suffragette...Just when you think the movie is over, writing appears (usually white on a black background) telling the audience what happened to the characters or the next stages in the historical events depicted. Drives me crazy. If it matters so much that there's a need to tell you what happened next, it should be in the movie. If it doesn't matter, there's no need to tell us about it.",2016
9,"That's what the NFL tells Omalu. Whether it's an accurate statement or not, you've got to have a strong religion to not take heed of the movie's message after watching it. And I do mean religion. Like the movie points out, the NFL owns a day of the week, the same day the church used to own. And that's not all they own. They have enough influence to make the FBI end the careers of Omalu and his boss at the Allegheny County coroner's office for daring to buck the NFL party line on concussions. Will Smith's performance is outstanding. And so is David Morse's as Mike Webster. The connection between the enormous hits we love to watch on the field and what happens to the human brain, floating inside a fluid-filled skull without any anatomical seat belt, is chilling. If you have children interested in this sport, they and you need to know there are risks beyond broken bones and ACLs.",2015
4,"Not a fan of the Will Smith school of acting. Very surprised he has made it this far with his acting chops. It's incredible that they would hire Will to play this role, when there are far better actors trained in the art. Chiwetel Ejiofor or Idris Elba, for example, I think, could pull off the accent and performance much better. Story aside, come on, we all know the story and the ending. It's not a very interesting topic (only 31M so far), but of course since I chose the movie last weekend, I was subject to my GFs choice this weekend. Her choice, strictly because of the Oscar controversy I should say! A very flat line story, with a star, when put in roles which are character studies and ones which he has to change his voice or appearance drastically (Ali, this role) he continuously acts as if he is impersonating the character. I would say the good ones impersonate without you noticing. I sat there looking at Will Smith impersonate a Nigerian not actually act like a Nigerian. I can't recommend.",2016
5,"Hilariously dumb and manipulative, it's entertaining on that level alone, although scary in that it's so boarder line that you can't be sure the movie was made with tongue anywhere near cheek, I'm inclined to think not. That this movie is serious, that America needs to feel like a scared kitten rescued by a big stack of muscles. That stack of muscles is Dwayne Johnson and it's hard not to love him. He's kinda good in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative propaganda. The special effects were nice. it kinda flowed, sort of, I guess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq level they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice. The cheesy flag at the end gives you another good piece of cheese to choke on. If we're going to go down we might as well go down stupid.",2015

The story line and plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't seen before, very clichéd and predictable. The Rock's performance in this film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film a bit more tolerable. If you're planning on seeing this film enjoy the ride for the visual effects and the action, don't expect very much more. I'm not going to say it's bad and I'm not going to say it's good.

After watching San Andres Fault by mistake I was so hopeful that nothing could be quite as bad as that. I was wrong. I know it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I just laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to happen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind of hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through it. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they are so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like Dwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him.

As for the common denominator for these kind of movies, at least the daughter no longer needs pull ups after the world was destroyed.

This is the disaster movie of disaster movies. No need for a strong story here. The special effects provide more than enough drama. The actual characters in the movie are ancillary to the story. It's about nature going wild, and on a scale that is beyond measuring. At the conclusion of the movie, San Francisco is a mess. Paul Giamatti is fantastic, and also quite amusing, as the scientist who predicts that the earthquake will strike - and nobody believes him until it is too late. By that time, the Hoover Dam is history and the rest of California is next in line. LA also gets hit, hard, but the director saves the best special effects for San Francisco. If you like movies that show total devastation, then this movie is for you. This movie delivers, or rather obliterates the goods!",2015

We all go to the movie to enjoy them not to be picking it apart over science. I can see this actually happening sometime in the future.

I will just nit-pick the opening scene real fast since IMDb reviews require 10 lines of text. So a car is hanging on the side of a mountain by a tree branch. It shifts and slides down three different times for dramatic effect... Stupid. Why would the LAFD take a reporter and her camera man on a dangerous rescue mission??? Stupid. The reporter asks one of the rescuers, ""What is the biggest difference from rescuing people here in LA, rather than in the Middle East?"" The guy says, ""Well, we aren't getting shot at over here.""

This is the Rock's movie, and that's a good thing. I won't say he's a great actor but - as he instructed so many others to do while he was in the WWE wrestling biz - he knows his role. The guy has a screen presence as big as Arnold or Stallone ever had and he can speak well. I won't tell any stuff that goes on, but some times there is so much happening on screen I was glad to be seeing on the big screen. One thing I will say is that I watched the whole movie without finding any flaws or disappointing moments. there are a lot of great movies that you can simply wait and see on DVD, or on a PC or whatever.

I can't remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character. Hathaway charms her way through the film and there's a nice cameo from Russo as a love interest. A film that doesn't try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it.",2015

The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic and didn't let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's. Good storyline. The ""Intern"" group of guys were funny too. I'd see this again.",2015

DeNiro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better. There were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many. Nothing slowed the pace for long. It was lovely to see ageism front and center, blasted to smithereens! Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. The boys ""road trip"" was hilarious.

Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. And Rene Russo is still gorgeous as ever. I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm who played Hathaway's husband. But then, actually, I was impressed with everyone in this movie. There really wasn't a single thing or character I would change in this one, and that's saying something. The casting, the plot, the dialogueand fancy this, it was a funny, touching, enjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude garbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It was well written, well -acted, and well presented. All rare these days where just the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. This one is evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent out there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and finding them! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending to everyone within reading or hearing distance. One of the best films we've seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the building.",2015
10,"All in all, I thought the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro was some of the best I've seen in a long long time. I kept forgetting that I was actually watching a movie. I didn't want it to end because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters. I don't understand why some reviewers said there was no character growth. Please read below to find out why I think there was. ",2016
8,"Sometimes you don't need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking. Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show and smile. That's the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy ""The Intern"" (PG-13, 2:01).",2015
5,"The Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to crank out. De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death and therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming e-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway. The film feels like one big fat commercial (and it actually is). At this hipster e-com company everyone works on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster house. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the label), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products are also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Even the music sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). Al these 'people' in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the 'problems' they have are just first world problems. I also could not stand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly helpful nitwits. If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character (it's written that way, he tries his best with it) it's hard to believe this was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Intern is also so Politically Correct it's sickening. You can feel being manipulated while watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in They Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have been paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial marinated in a forced 'feel good' message.",2016
2,This is one of my most boring and horrible experiences in cinema. ,2015
1,"I hadn't fully grasped the meaning of the word ""agony"" until I went to the cinema last night and watched ""The Intern"". Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a cinephile, I have seen a few movies in my life and I have opinions, that's about it. What's amazing about ""The Intern"" is that there is not one single event unfolding on the screen that would provoke a reaction in the viewer. At some point I felt like checking people's pulses, as we had all been sitting there for more than an hour and I hadn't heard a single comment. This movie is a horrible display of stereotyped anthropology, both old and new clichés, with a sequence of facts narrated with no connection whatsoever between them. It doesn't make you cry, it doesn't make you laugh, it's just a two hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a control group in a lab. But at least in that case you would get some vouchers. Do not buy any snacks as you'll end up with appendicitis, cause you'll devour them all in the attempt of killing time. When you finally think the torture is over, a ""twist"" in the story makes you dread that you will have to watch the extra time of this stalemate between boredom and uselessness. One last warning: be ready for the cheesiest lines and shots you've ever seen. Close-up of toothbrushes to symbolize love, narrative stratagems that don't make any sense and a constant celebration of relationship in the most banal way are the main traits to this movie. The bottom line of ""The Intern"" is you should keep working like crazy and eat junk food, as long as you cycle in your own office, have a massive house in the heart of Brooklyn and make millions with the company you created. There is one good thing about this film though, and it was leaving the cinema to go home and watch another one.",2015
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. A feel-good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars will likely have box office success and cause a lot of people to laugh out loud. In other words, the latest from writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its entertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics. OK, I'll give it a try.",2015
5,"Not a comedy, not a drama, unfortunately this film fails in the end to entertain. Even though the main idea is brilliant, the script unfortunately fails to deliver. There are at least four(4) parallel subplots going on: i) the retired widowed executive wishing to stay active, ii) a startup growing too fast for its founders to cope with, facing the urge of installing an external CEO, iii) the romance the ""intern"" finds and iv) the price the founder of the start-up needs to pay in the personal front with the husband cheating on her. Apparently the creators of the film wanted to see the plot in its holistic dimension, forgetting they just had 120min of film (too much for a comedy anyhow) to convey it to the audience.",2015
9,"The Intern brings you to the life of a 70 year old who doesn't want to live an average retired old man routine because he still feels he has music (metaphorically) left in him. So he takes up a senior intern job at an online fashion site with a completely different environment and people than what he has worked all his life. He meets the founder and while working with her, becomes her confidant and mentor. ",2015
1,"You have to imagine Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have their pick of projects. They must have piles of scripts sent to them. And this is the one they choose to spend their time on? The only intrigue this film offers is pondering the 'why' of that question. An IT start up takes on senior citizen interns because... well, the reasons are never quite explained. The older guys mock 'tweets,' and not tucking your shirt in. The younger guys mock a lack of tech savvy. Among all this gentle (i.e. not funny) humour about generation gaps, a bawdy joke about an inappropriate erection appears. Then some bizarre break in and escape from the cops. Meanwhile, a successful woman will inevitably be betrayed by the man in her life, the narrative tells us. Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters: what did this A-list cast see in the script? Does Nancy Meyers have incriminating negatives in a vault somewhere? Modern-day Hollywood genre filmmaking at its most putrid.",2016
1,"What wishy washy nonsense! Weak story, one-dimensional, boring stereotypical characters! Filled with endless clichés and improbable situations. Sickly sweet and unrealistic behavior of the main characters, far removed from reality. Why can't they make good movies anymore?! I suffered through 2 hours of it. I guess I was hoping for a miracle, for a twist that would elevate it above the level of a filler. But no, to the very end it kept the quality of adolescent slush with no depth or sophistication. I guess I can't expect more from an Anne Hathaway movie. What a waste of time! I recommend that you give this one a miss.",2015
2,"Did anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie is good? This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an ocean. The idea of mixing a pompously acting Robert De Niro with a hysterically acting Anne Hathaway is an example of how not generate on-screen chemistry. Not that the acting is bad. It's the story. It's one ongoing cliché. It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived. It's Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the characters take themselves seriously. This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clichés. A bored older retiree with nothing but time and a manic young business woman. C'mon! Not exactly the cutting edge of literary originality. And what is worse, they are not funny characters. The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players. Now the story has potential. The movie actually starts strongly. The De Niro character is introduced and his issues clearly presented. Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly. A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale. This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions.",2015
2,A movie with so much potential leaves you wishing there was an extra hour to the move so that it can end far far far better than it did.,2015
10,Dragon Ball Super does not go into full blown action packed episodes from the start unlike it's DBZ counterpart. It starts with a more funny and story based start and I like it cause newer fans can get use to the characters. It's been 18 years since the last episode of DBZ and some people didn't get the chance to watch DBZ or know all it's characters but they can now.I use to hate it when people said that DBZ has no story and is all action right off the bat but now DBS shows how the characters are developing before the big battles arrive. The starting is amazing for both old Fans and new ones.,2015
10,"I'm reading the other reviews and all I'm hearing is a bunch of complaining. I don't see any difference in the original Dragon Ball and DBZ to Dragon Ball Super. Its fun and goofy just like the originals. I think most of you need to go back and watch the series again and let go of the awesomeness you remember as a child. It was epic but I think most of you are stuck on the feeling you had while watching it as a kid to what the show actually was.Dragon Ball Super to me, feels the same. It reminds me of the originals. It is fun, quirky and at times slightly goofy. The story starts great bringing the cast in full view and giving a little bit of back story. I never expected it to come out in full force with epic battles in the first few minutes. I personally like a story, the originals had a great story not just epic battles. Even other great anime have great story with lots of filler. I think people have had too many expectations for this show from the beginning and aren't giving it a chance. My advice is to give it some time.",2015
10,"Say what you say about the animation in some episodes, nothing stops me from loving this show! Dragon Ball Z is a big part of my childhood and i am glad that we have a new series. Sure the first arcs are based Battle of Gods and Resurrection F, but i don't mind this at all as in my mind it's a good idea to make these arcs for those who have not seen the two movies, which are all canon and so is this show. I think the real highlight will be the new Arc, where the Z-Fighters are heading to a new Tournament between the 7th Universe and the 6th Universe. Hopefully we get an English Dub of this anime, cause when it comes to Dragon Ball, it's one of those few anime you see in English. Oh and IMDb, tell Google to fix a problem when every time i search Dragon Ball Super, the rating is 7.9 on Google, but when i clicked it, it leads to Dragon Ball Absalon. Just a word of advice.",2016
10,Childhood is back with a Bang! ,2015
10,"As for now i really love what i see in this series even though there was just 3 episodes for now. It's really great to see this anime was still going, it brings back all my memories when i was a child. ",2015
8,"The First Episode of the much anticipated come back of the DBZ Series was just awesome. Brought back old memories of childhood! The story starting before The Battle of Gods and Goku not fighting but farming was a bit down, but I hope things will get better in the upcoming episodes. The wait is still on for the dubbed version. The second episode - Vegeta's Family trip is expected to be comic and exiting as the DBZ fans have never seen one (Vegeta's family trip). Goku is also going to go to King Kai's place to train! I think this will be like old times. There are also rumors about the 9 star Dragon Ball which is confirmed to be in Shanpa's(New Character) Universe. Over all an excellent opening after 18 Years!",2015
1,"Before I start this review off, I just want to go on record and say that I've been a huge Dragonball Z fan since I was in primary school in the early 90s. Since then I've branched out into multiple anime and have come to appreciate and respect the hard work and art styles behind the genre. I would also like to note that this review is a non- biased account from a viewer, who enjoys a good show as well as a good story above anything else.",2016
8,"I remember watching Dragon Ball Z from the TV when I was a kid and was really excited about it, although I didn't watch it regularly.",2016
8,I will admit i'm disappointing it's basically a retelling of the movies so far (Battle of gods and resurrection F) but it's nice to get a lot more back story witch is something that could not be done with the time constraints of the movies.,2015
9,"Great anime is what it is. Lovable characters, intense action, humor, and anticipation are all blended into a seemingly never ending story that keeps you wanting for more. The variety of new characters that this new series brings is especially wonderful - it's both, wide and thoughtful. The fight sequences are good as ever, with thrilling and suspenseful moments that draw you the more.. can't wait for Sundays!",2016
1,"An insult to the Dragon Ball franchise, characters, and fans. Absolute garbage. Sit back kids, because this is review is going to be one hell of a horrible ride.",2016
3,"I honestly am not sure if my opinion will make a difference here, but I'd rather say what I have to say about it.",2016
4,"The Dragon ball series is beloved by many people of differing ages and cultures, for a lot of people they grew up with the show. Like many people its a franchise close to my heart. Which is why i'm so disappointed in this show. It feels like wasted potential, filler, or even a parody. Dragon Ball is known for its off beat brand of humor, and most of the time it's pretty well placed, but Super seems to take it and just spread it all over the place with no care about anything else. The fights are never taken seriously, even when Goku fights Freiza, quite possibly one of his most hated opponent, he's hardly serious, even when Freiza outclasses him. Looking at this show, it's hard to tell it was born from Dragon Ball Z, which had excellent characters, arcs, and conflicts. Probably the biggest fault with this show currently is the Champa arc. The multiverse tournament is just plain boring and predictable thus far. The six opponents from the 6th universe are disappointing, aside from maybe the purple man whom weve yet to see anything from yet. The Saiyan Cabba is a direct opposite to Vegeta, The yellow fighter Botamo was boring, and Frost turned out to be evil, like we didn't see that coming. The characters are just boring, old and new. Gohans been pushed aside once more, which is disappointing given his history, Champa is a spoiled child like Beerus and all around just uninteresting, and everyone else feels like a shadow of their former selves. ",2016
1,"I was actually hyped for this, no joke. I had high hopes for hopes, I likes the movies, and you know what? MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD CAME CRASHING DOWN FASTER THAN YAMCHA! The animation was lack-luster, the main character sounds like a 80 year old grandma and is even dumber than I imagined, all the other characters are piles of wasted potential, the first two arcs were rehashed movies, and worst part f all, NOTHING IS EVER SERIOUS! Even the original creator",2016
2,"How to destroy Dragon Ball , graphic description . And the worst thing is that this snafu has ' ' 8.5 ' ' valuation . The plot is a mess and some very odious characters . Champa and Bills in my opinion abound in series . Monaka repellent and has no charisma , Vegeta and even speak, a cold character , have become the super trash legendary.",2016
1,Coming from an old fan of the series DBS feels like a cheap DBZ rip off in every way possible and because of that it stains the image of one of the greatest anime shows ever made,2016
10,"Dragon Ball Super is absolutely fantastic. It brings back everything we loved about the original and the Z series (especially the Z series). Thank Beerus it completely deletes the events of the garbage that was GT, so that it becomes nothing more than fan fiction. The God storyline is much needed and it opens up a whole new world with these dimensions. Once again we get a unique and awesome villain (if he will become one eventually) in the form of Beerus. The SSG form is kind of okay, but the SSGSS form is really cool. No need for that abomination form SSJ4... Even the fillers are entertaining. Dragon Ball always had fillers, and Super is no exception, if you hated it before you will hate it now, I personally really enjoy it. The first episode of Super was like a dream come true to me. I would never thought that I would see another Dragon Ball episode. My only complaint is that Gohan is being left behind. I think his character has room for more development, but it is not such a huge problem. I cant wait to see where does Toriyama takes this new series.",2015
10,"Okay, first I have to address that the first 16 (appx.) episodes are a retelling of Battle of Gods. This, as I have noticed, has turned quite a few people off - understandably. However, the execution of this retelling is, in my opinion, masterful. Where the movie starts at the awakening of Beerus the Destroyer and moves directly onto King Kai's planet, in ""Super"" we see a little more of Beerus - including destroying some planets with a magnificent power. Beerus, himself, is portrayed in a much darker - more villainous light. He is a little less like a teacher, and a little more like a foe, nearly destroying the universe during the battle with Goku - just by the extreme shockwaves their battle was echoing. There are more differences. Bulma's birthday party take place on a cruise ship. Scripting is a little more series-like, but still very much on par with the greatness that made DBZ. Of course we have the return of Pilaf, Mai and Shu in their little baby bodies (I love that these characters were brought back, I believe for the first time since the original Dragon Ball series). The graphically enhanced auras which surround SSG Goku and Beerus are still present, even more signaling the vast improvement in the animation. The energy balls which Beerus fires (some of which were fired in swarming numbers at Goku) look more like a swirling atomic ball than just a normal energy ball - which I think further enhances the animation presence. BUT the best thing yet, was that this first saga is nowhere NEAR as long, tedious and laden with filler as some of the more prominent battles from DBZ. No whole ""season"" dedicated to one fight, no three-episode power-ups, and though these particular battles - being Majin Buu, Frieza and Cell - were memorable and awesome, its nice that there is a more fast pace to this series so far. No - it's not all original like everyone hoped for (except for the one-episode battle which followed Beerus's saga in which we have a very vivid picture of what Mr. Satan would look like as a Super Saiyan - classic), but so far it is what it is, and it's Toriyama - finally. Despite this re-imagining, as well as the upcoming re-imagining of ""Resurrection F"", there are a TON more episodes that are following, hopefully with surprises the fans have been waiting for. The second saga also goes into more detail - such as training with Whis, Whis's love for earth cuisine and his constant visiting Bulma so she can feed him, and more curiously - the outfit changes with Goku and Vegeta (the explanation behind them). We have also been introduced to Champa (?) (aka Fat Beerus, as he has been so lovingly named) and his female Whis-like servant. I have been following the series since it started, and I can't wait to see more.",2015
2,I have found out these major problems with the series which i stop to watch after last episode (25 episode i think). True dragonball fans will understand these major problems with this series,2015
3,"The fight scenes are shorter and the animation is bad. The auras were way better in DBZ. The music is nowhere close to the epic music composed by Bruce Faulconer for DBZ. Whatever happened to having awesome background music during battle scenes. The show is made targeting only young kids. If you are above 10, you might find it boring. Dragon Ball GT despite all its criticism is way better than Dragon Ball Super. Dragon Ball Z was enjoyable for all age groups. The battle of gods saga and resurrection of F were produced really well. But the episodes after those were of very poor quality in comparison. The Villains don't fell dangerous enough, on the contrary they are comic. The characters of Goku and his friends were not developed well.",2016
2,"The first thing that upsets me is the power scaling, like how the hell would a weakling be able push back someone who has reached a God level, and there are lots more which i don't want to mention all. Please if u're sucks at Maths, ask for opinion from a pro maths before writing.",2017
4,"This anime has a serious problem with its plot. Any sense of danger is completely destroyed by the shoehorning of two unnecessarily powerful characters into every arc who only seem to undermine threats by showing no interest in the fight, sipping lemonade and yelling for lunch as protagonists engage in death battles with world busting foes.",2016
1,DBSuper should not exist.,2016
1,"OK for anyone who's bored to read this long review I'll sum it up in a few lines. I believe that the only reason DBS exists is to make money. To milk the cow. It's like Weekend at Barney's in how I met your mother. They take a corpse they put clothes, sunglasses and make up on it and move it around like it's a living person. It's not. This is humiliating for Dragon Ball and for Toriyama...I'm wondering isn't he bit ashamed of what he's done?",2016
7,"The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. In Legend, that story isn't really taken to its full potential, thanks to an unfortunately clunky structure despite brilliant performances, good humour and violence.",2015
6,"Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives of the movie end.",2015
8,"The original film about the subject ""The Krays"" (1990) had Billie Whitelaw as their mother and, somehow, she dominated my memory of the film. Here the twins have a mother but she is, on the film, a distant character and that's what I missed here. I missed their interaction. She clearly had a massive influence in their characters but in Legend, those pieces of the puzzle are unfortunately missing. But, Tom Hardy compensates for any flaws. He is extraordinary, twice. The twins are total individuals, totally two people. What they carry in common is a sort of sexual danger, one explicitly the other implicitly but both as powerful. They dare us to get close. Amazing performance(s)",2017
5,"The only good thing about this very average film is Tom Hardy's acting. A lesser talented actor would have made it almost unwatchable. Short on facts, the writers here have just invented or borrowed bits to try and make the film sensational. It hasn't worked very well but at least shows the 'Krays' were a couple of psychopathic violent lunatics whose scrambled brains believed they were something special. Fact is, in this film, the one bit of fact we do know was said by Chas Palmintiri as Angelo Bruno the Philly mob boss, 'mobsters should keep a low profile'. Ironically poor old Angelo Bruno got whacked by Nicky Scarfo, a psychopath mafiosi who just like the 'Krays' loved being high profile and just like the Krays was sentenced to die in prison.",2015
7,"Tom Hardy is a strange fish as an actor. Famous for being almost incomprehensible in ""The Dark Night Rises"" and almost equally incomprehensible in his co-starring role in ""The Revenant"", it's sometimes really difficult to get a sense of his true abilities. Here in ""Legend"" he gets to show what he's made of. Twice! Hardy plays both roles in the story of Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the infamous gangsters who ruled across large parts of London in the 1960's.",2016
7,"I was really looking forward to this one; the trailers were great and, whilst I'm not one of those who glamourise the Krays (they loved their mums, would do anything for you blah blah blah), I do find it bizarrely fascinating how the Krays/Richardsons have passed into London folklore. Alas, it's a bit of a let down. Hardy throws himself into both roles, by turns amusing and scary as Ronnie and compelling as a Reggie trying to build an empire while struggling to keep his brother in check. But he is let down by a clunky structure, it takes a while to get going and subplots and characters are introduced and then discarded on a whim, an awful Frances Kray voice-over, and an uneven script which can't quite decide if it wants to be an American style gangster flick or tread the same path as The Long Good Friday, Get Carter et al. And who let Duffy and her nails down a blackboard voice back in? I really hoped we'd seen the last of her after that crap Diet Coke ad. The club scenes aren't quite working guys. I know, let's get Duffy, stuck a wig on her and she can caterwaul her way through some 60s classics. High five!!!",2015
8,"The infamous Kray brothers – identical twins Reggie and Ronnie – are so well known in British gangster history they've already had multiple films made about them. What writer-director Brian Helgeland brings to the table with his take on the notorious siblings is exuberant storytelling, classy visual styling and a tour de force performance by Tom Hardy as both twins. Hardy's dual turn is undeniably the centrepiece of the movie. His Reggie is all charm and swagger, with intelligence and ambition to boot, whilst the schizophrenic Ronnie is a short-tempered ball of emotional bluster. Helgeland sensibly opts to make Reggie the focus; of the two he is the more grounded one, a gangster with lofty aspirations and the ability to interact on a human level with those around him to make his goals a reality. There is also genuine chemistry between Hardy (as Reggie) and Emily Browning, her fragile yet strong-willed Frances able to draw out the romantic side of Reggie, making his bursts of savagery all the more terrifying. Sporadically placed throughout the (overlong) two hour plus runtime, the bouts of violence bubble with intensity and exhilaration, often uneasily enjoyable thanks to moments of levity sprinkled alongside them. The 60s setting is capitalised on too, Dick Pope's elegant photography giving proceedings a classical feel while Carter Burwell's powerfully soulful score affects deeply at all the right times. There's a sense of glorification here that mightn't sit well with some audience members, however the Krays were adored in the East End and to deny the glitzier parts of their life would be to deny what made them popular to begin with. An exceptional crime picture with two outstanding performances from one man, proving again that Hardy really is an acting legend.",2015
5,"When you walk into a film with not one but two leading performances by Tom Hardy, who's back catalogue brings nothing but pleasure (apart from This Means War, but we'll let that slide), you cant help but feel disappointed when you leave the screen completely unaffected by what you've just watched, and that was certainly how I felt hen it came to Legend.",2015
8,"Tom Hardy gives an all time great performance, double acting as both the notorious Kray twins. The story is also quite comedic, clever and full of some great thrilling scenes. One of the great things about this film is you know what you're going to get, and it delivers, then some. It's bloody on top of witty, charming and fun. Legend serves up one of the great films of the year, whilst also being quite modest in its approach. ",2015
4,"I bet that you, like me, walked into the theatre expecting to see a gangster movie about the Kray twins only the film is not about them at all. Instead the central character is Frances and the entire story is told from her point of view. You don't get a picture of the criminal world just long love scenes between Reggie and Frances.",2015
9,"First off, hats off to the acting in this film - the cast did an amazing job. ",2015
5,"If asked what this film is ""about"", you can respond that it's about the Krays - and you can't be much more specific than that.",2015
7,"It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.",2015

7,"Legend is the true story of twin brother gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, notorious criminals who built an organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.",2015
2,"I was looking forward to this film being a definitive story of the Kray's, what we get instead is a well acted, scripted and filmed movie, nothing more nothing less.This film tries to portray a pair of vicious and bullying thugs as some sort of misunderstood deep characters. Nipper Read is shown as the archetypal copper , a sort of joke figure, which he certainly wasn't, he brought down the Kray's with his dogged determination to get them put away and pay for their crimes. We hear nothing of their gang of accomplices , nothing of their attempts to get others to take the fall for their crimes when they were caught. Jack ""the hat"" McVitie is shown as a figure who was scared of the Krays , which he was not and is why he incurred their wrath. When Reggie killed Jack all the guests had been sent away and the only people present were gang members , why do film makers feel the need to go against the true nature of what actually happened ? The film as a vehicle for Tom Hardy to shine is brilliant , he takes both parts and runs with them so that you believe they are totally different people. However that is all the film is a Tom Hardy acting class.The whole film is dull and annoying, we are talking about two of the most ""iconic"" of London's underworld and we see nothing of real interest only some broken love story.There is no background to this story it just rumbles along and expects everyone to join in on the ride. If film makers are going to produce true stories then please stick to the reality of the events ,not what you wanted to have happened or how you wanted it to happen",2015
2,"The only thing legendary about this film is the boredom it creates. Marketed as a ""gangster"" film, the film falls way short of the mark. Instead it dwells on the mental instability of one of the brothers and the ill-fated love life of the other brother. The film disappoints on all 3 levels – it is not a satisfactory gangster film, nor a very compelling love story, nor will it give you much insight into mental illness.",2015

9,"I read The Profession Of Violence by John Pearson some years ago which this film is based on - and wanted to see a movie about the Krays - I watched The Krays with the Kemp brothers and despite many an accolade bestowed thought it was just an average film - so armed with that I approached Legend with some anticipation. Growing up in rural Britain my film hero's were like many of us Deniro,Pacino,Walken etc - Never had a real British film star I was amazed at until Tom Hardy came on the scene - so after watching Lawless ,The Drop and The Revenant was extremely proud of having a British actor that in my mind measured up to said heavyweights! Legend is a true representation not only of the book but of the Krays story - yes there were some comedic moments in the film with Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie - but they captured the real essence of Ronnie's mistrust and paranoia. The supporting actors are brilliantly cast and noteworthy performances by Emily Browning ,Christopher Eccleston and the very brilliant David Thewlis - not to mention a great cameo by Chazz Palminteri make this a must see film. I would have given this a 10 but waiting for Hardy's next film to do that",2016

8,"Maybe I am bias but I love the story of the Krays. I had been waiting for a long time to see this movie ever since I saw the preview for it. While it was not the 10/10 that I was hoping it would be, it was an excellent movie. It was well shot, the script was good, and the story of the Krays is a very good story. My biggest complaint of the movie was it seemed to short. You get a snippet into the history and the story of the Krays starting in the middle years where Ron is already in the mental institution. I personally was left wanting to see more. I wanted to the the movie start from the early years, show the building of the crime empire and then the end of their run. I think the early years really solidify the bond between the two brothers and that bond is simply missing and taken for granted in the movie. Having said that there was a lot of time they were covering in this movie. For that reason you miss a lot of the building of the empire, how they started and what pieces fit together were. I think that is why this movie has such a low rating of 7/10 with most viewers. I think it is also why I feel it was a bit of a let down from what I was really hoping to get. The acting in the movie was bril. Tom Hardy does a really good job in both roles. He sells the characters very well, he accent is even pretty good as well. The script writing was very good given the time limitations. If you don't know the story of the Krays, it is a great watch. If you are familiar with the story, just don't expect to see the whole story unfold. Would gladly watch this movie again and recommend it to you.",2015
8,"I really enjoyed this film. It does make out the Krays to be quite comical, especially Ronnie Kray. When in reality they were complete thugs and bullies. But as entertainment this was a great film, which is worth the admission price to see Tom Hardy play both roles.",2015

3,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a wonderbra.",2016
1,"I liked the first, I loved the second, I thought the extended trailer was silly (shoot down high-tech planes with a bow, also called Mockingjay Part 1), but then I was in for an ice cold shower. I haven't felt like this since listening to Jar Jar Binks.",2016
1,"I want 2 hours of my life back! It was tedious, linear, uneventful, predictable, and dialogues often scrambled. This is not the worst film I ever saw, but I've seen lots of films, and this episode is perhaps the 4th worst ever. From top of my head I can name a few more bearable things. Say, IRS. I mentioned drying paint before. Even hangover can be more fun. Or toothache. Walking the streets alone, minding my own business is immensely more fun. To spare myself from future torture, I'll make sure to check the IMDb comments first, sorting them by the ""hated it"" criterion. Why suffer? I just hope my comment will save at least one person from suffering.",2016
10,I am a Muslim belly dancer and I love watching movies in free time. This is my first comment on IMDb. The Hunger Games:Mocking Jay Part 2 is an interesting sequel to part 1. It is the story of a strong woman rebel Katnis Everdeen fighting against a dictator president. The film is entertaining with action.When you see this movie you will feel with rebels who have been oppressed and you will come to the feeling that evil doers and dictators will sooner or later get destroyed as a result of their wickedness.,2015
5,"I watched the Hunger Games and Catching Fire movies before reading the books. The story was so captivating that I had to read the books. Mockingjay part 1 was already a slight disappointment because they dragged out the final book into 2 parts. As such, I already didn't have high expectations for part 2.",2015
10,"Mokcingjay part 2 has a fantastic, brutal and honest look at the affects and harshness of war, coated and enriched with a deep and thoughtful exploration of the series' dark and gritty themes. It pushes the 12A certificate it owns to the max and uses it to its advantage.",2015
3,"I must admit when I first heard of the Hunger Games movies I had no idea what all the fuss was about. I'd never heard of the books, so wasn't that excited about the movies. ",2016
10,"The movie is a lot like I anticipated it to be. Special effects, plot and acting is like all its other installments, amazing. Having read the book, there are obviously scenes and parts that were 'left out' just like all the other movies that have been adapted from a novel. Especially the Mockingjay, being the last book of the trilogy, there is no room for denial that there are way too many events or scenes to incorporate in the movie. Despite that, the movie was still a thriller. ",2015
1,"All the series of The Hunger Games had a main element which was the emotion for ""riots"", ""stand up for what is yours"" while we all, mostly me expected the FINAL episode of The Hunger Games this to be the most expressed element they lacked of it a lot. Most of us while watching the the movie will find it boring impatiently waiting for what will happen at the end. It is disappointing to see such an awful final movie of the series Mockingjay. If i was the director when i would be seeing the movie for the first time i would not publish and either make a whole new film or not publish it at all. This film is meant for teenage girls which ""fall in love"" deeply in some of the characters and it disappointed all other ""fans"" which were having big expectations for the final film.",2016
9,"When The Hunger Games was first released almost four years ago, I had no idea it was going to be the successful franchise it is now. I was fourteen when I watched the first film and began reading the books and each film just got better and better. This is definitely the case with Mockingjay Part 2, the thrilling and emotional conclusion of the franchise. I would also say that this is the film that, I think, is the most faithful to the original book of the same name. There were so many parts in the film that I remembered reading about when I first read the book three years ago. Whilst I was reading the books, I didn't know how the cast and crew were going to make a film adaptation in a creative and successful way. Nevertheless, they managed to do it. Jennifer Lawrence returns, for one last time, as Katniss Everdeen, the main protagonist. In Mockingjay Part 1, Katniss is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and is finding it difficult to cope without Peeta Mellark, her former tribute and love interest from District 12, as she doesn't know if he's dead or alive. She meets the President of District 13, Alma Coin, who is unsure that she is the right person to be the face of the revolution due to her struggles. However, Katniss proves her wrong and films short films, known as 'propagandas', to distract the Capitol and to persuade the people of Panem to join her fight against President Snow. However, things don't all go to plan because, when Peeta is rescued, he has been hijacked and tries to kill Katniss. This is because he's been hijacked which means that the Capitol has corrupted his memories of her to make her appear violent or a threat to him. Now, Mockingjay: Part 2 picks straight up where Mockingjay: Part 1 left, with Katniss recovering from her injury. Despite her struggles, she is still willing to be part of the fight against the Capitol but President Coin refuses and sends her to District 2 to film a propaganda, much to her annoyance. She is desperate to kill President Snow for everything he has done and goes on a rogue mission to join her fellow soldiers to take over the Capitol. President Coin is not happy with this and sends Peeta, who still has negative views on Katniss and continues to have violent acts of rage towards her. However, he is slowly recovering from his disordered views of Katniss and he begins a game called 'Real Or Not Real' to help him know the truth. This was one of my favourite parts in the book as I thought it was a clever way to help Peeta understand his disordered image. Director Francis Lawrence has stated that this is the most violent out of all The Hunger Games and he's not wrong. When, fellow tribute, Finnick mockingly states, 'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 76th Hunger Games', it truly is like that. The Capitol itself is like an arena with thousands of deadly traps and bombs, known as Pods, lying on every corner. Katniss and her team of soldiers, one of which includes friend Gale Hawthorne, must avoid all of these traps in order to make it to the President's mansion. I had read the books so I knew what was going to happen but I was still shocked at how brutal certain people's deaths were. One specific death scene had me in tears when I first watched it as the character was one of the most likable in the series and the character died in such a violent way. There was also another death scene which had me in tears but wasn't as violent as it was so sudden. These deaths may come as a shock to people who haven't read the books. There are several new characters played by some of the best actors. Despite being only on screen for a short time, they still manage to pull it off. In fact, every actor in this film was amazing, especially Jennifer Lawrence. She is perfect as Katniss and really understands her character well. Throughout the films, I think she's definitely matured and grown into the role. I've also got to mention Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. In The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, Peeta had a charming and sweet personality but in this film, he's lost that charm due to the Capitol torturing him. He goes from being violent one minute to being really emotional. Josh really managed to make me feel sympathy for Peeta. I think this is a great conclusion to one of the biggest film franchises and I would definitely say that it's the best of the four films as there's plenty of violence, suspense and emotional moments. With brilliant acting, intense scenes, amazing special effects and great directing, this is one of the best book- to-film adaptations I've ever watched.",2015

Horrible acting, full of cliché lines, completely out of context, story-line, you name it...I try to understand fans, try to understand people that loved the books, but oh lord, how can someone rate this with more than average ( at best ) is beyond me.",2016
1,"War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.",2015
10,"Which I didn't mean by disappointing. From my point of view, it's different by the way the makers decided to end this movie. For a usual blockbuster, you expect some kind of triumph and cheeriness, especially for a finale. In this case it's not. Somehow it makes this particular 'Hunger Games' even more interesting than I thought.",2015
4,"Such a long wait for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015), was it worth the waiting? To answer that I'd need to point out a few variables.

10,"This is my first time on IMDb or any other sites similar, simply because I feel I need to set some things straight. I have no idea why this film has such bad reviews. Having been an avid follower of the series since it began I still went into this movie prepared for the worst and ready to be critical if need be (because of the reviews I had heard). Start to finish however I don't think I moved once. I genuinely think this is almost the best of the four, beaten only perhaps by the first for obvious reasons. I thoroughly appreciated the way the directors have kept the films to the book and Mockingjay PtII was no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely outstanding in this film and by all means deserves to be well recognized for her performance. The others also should not be forgotten, Liam Hemsworth really stepped out in this film as did many of the other supporting acts. For those complaining it was slow paced, I am not sure what you wanted. It kept me on edge the entire way through and was actually enhanced by the moments of quieter reflection that other ""action"" movies often lack. It contained immense depth, astounding cinematography and visual effects. Lastly, I think the ending was utterly beautiful. This book, this series, is somber. It's dark, its reflective and it alludes to a number of very serious themes. The directors dealt with this incredibly well. The film is a perfect ending to the series, my only disappointment is that it is the last.",2015

Brought to you from the lovely minds of Marti Noxon and Sarah Gertrude Shapiro.",2015
10,...it gets really interesting. Maybe it's a little over the top but still - as a viewer of reality shows - that's how it has to be made... I definitely think that this show is worth a shot and that the ongoing plot might be more interesting than the first twenty minutes.,2015

If you're looking for something that'll make you think and feel good about watching with positive, happy people, then this might not be for you (Lifetime generally isn't at all like PBS). But if you, like me, hate reality TV and would like to see the gritty, honest (as honest as they can for TV) side of film making and how people behave behind the scenes to wreak drama and tension for ratings, or the shots that viewers think are ""real"" and not heavily edited or manipulated, then this show is for you. ",2016
9,"This show gives u a new perspective on so called reality TVs. After watching this u will never see them in a same way again. And imo that is not a bad thing. (Unlike some previous comments who were trashing this show for lacking ""in colors"" I am tired of watching obnoxious cliché and predictable shows. Shows about super perfect heroes who alone can change the world and all that ... all those unreal role models. If we dress them in pink and put some sparkles on, world would be a better place? You have got to be kidding me. If we close our eyes others can still see us duh. How can u change what is wrong ""in a world"" if u turn your head away, srsly. Anyway..) This show is well written. Acting is very good, characters are interesting, realistic and intriguing. Story looks promising and with a bit of imagination can develop indefinite. I see this show failing in only one way - by ""overdoing it"" and coming to a point when this show starts to fit its own name. Looking forward to see what happens next. So far so good.",2015

The manipulation of the lead characters is stunning in it's depravity. As a friend who's watched it said, ""this is on Lifetime?"" I'm no fan of reality TV and this skewers it to the wall, warts and all. I have a suspicion that there's a good bit of truth behind this show, from the story lines, the ""girls"" and the ""bachelor"" and the crew. It's equally entertaining and frightening. Saw all four currently out in sequence, but each one is great. Sometimes brutal, the well-acted psychosis of the main characters is worth the watch.",2015

5,"This show is groundbreaking as I believe it is the first to delve deeply into the machinations that take place behind-the-scenes in reality TV. The reality behind the 'Reality' is absolutely uncomfortable viewing, with unpleasant and (for the most) unlikable central characters whose self-interested manipulations drive the plot lines. The show could be better if character motivation was explored more thoroughly and was more coherent and believable. Also, some plot points stretch credibility to breaking point. For example (*SPOILER ALERT) The suicide note faked by Rachel used to admonish the producers' responsibility in relation to a contestant's death would have been confiscated by the police and soon found to be a fake.

It had me yearning for more i'm literally so upset that the season is over, I hope there's a season two. Watching Adam and Rachle have like these secret passionate talks made me get all excited inside I knew they were going to hook up from the beginning. I pictured Adam picking Rachel in the end to be his wife and Rachle transforming like miss congeniality. All though she looks good still for being on set for that long.

I loved it because we watch/I watch Reality shows all the time, in every channel, they have become so important in our society and the worst part is that we actually believe its true!!!! And there is so much more behind!!! They don't show you the way they play with the women, how they use them and how they manipulate all the information just to get audience... And sometimes we don't realize that reality shows are script, they're just people performing, it's great to watch all those things from the other side of the camera. Great show I just hope it doesn't get canceled!! I wanna watch more.",2015

The character dialogue is wonderfully written, particularly for the character Quinn. I am always happy to find programs with strong female characters and this one really tops it for me. ""Reality"" and reality TV are placed side by side, showing female stereotypes, their creation for the media and the women and men behind them. Rachel and Quinn may not be how you imagine feminists, but they raise a lot of interesting questions about female agency. I highly recommend watching, definitely a ten out of ten rating. More shows like this please! Its about time we had some decent female leads in television and I feel like UnREAL is also trying to tell us this.",2016
10,"Great series. Glad someone finally did a show about the unreality of reality TV. They nailed it. It shows how morally challenging those shows are, And how they manipulated.

They have too many of these cheapo movies this show is the real deal. Run don't walk to see Unreal with Constance Zimmer. Al;ways been a big fan of hers from Entourage and now an Emmy nominee!!!!!!! Incredible. Hope she wins she deserves it You watch actors over the years develop and she really has.

8,"I'm not surprised this series' season 3 won't be out until 2018. Whatever the reason, the writing of this series will be a hard act to follow, along with the fine performances. The art-imitating-life conundrum seems to be, how can this show not become a pale imitation of its previous season, in much the same way as the reality-TV series production it portrays? Writing, acting, casting and direction -- all are essential, and shake-ups are invariably necessary to keep an incredibly fast-paced, over-the-top, extremely formulaic success like this afloat. While I'd be happy if reality TV died and films were made on film again, it won't happen. But this series, this is art, about ""reality"" TV. May it survive and flourish, like Andy Warhol's soup can.",2017

10,"This is a phenomenal show that just keeps getting better. I'd say the smartest thing they did with this show is to have multiple story lines merged together. If you ever get bored of one character's story (which I have yet to do) you see another one's. The characters are so well developed and the drama is enticing. Even the temporary cast (the contestants) have intriguing stories. But the women who run the reality show have stolen my heart. Strong, powerful, smart women in charge makes this show actually female-friendly compared to the type of show they produce. I'm not a fan of reality shows but this almost satirical take on them is my new guilty pleasure. ",2017

However, there's just no logic connections between the scenes and the viewers are often left wondering how things got ended up here. I guess is that the director or producer wanted to give the show a documentary touch so instead of making the plot and scenes flow logically and smoothly, they just randomly shoot people talking, walking and doing things.",2015

I watched only a few minutes of it and will never watch it again. Have you no moral boundaries? Geez The dating shows are getting worse too. Used to be fun and gave us dreams of a good ending. What is happening to this world? Can't we hold anything sacred? People need to see things that are happy, give hope, and show well adjusted people. Why show people how not to be but show them what a good person is. Show them role models. The world would be a better place.",2015

After the recent awesome avenger movies and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The story has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist doing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader.

3,"Fantastic Four started catching my eye in the casting stage. Seemingly not giving a damn about the source material, it was refreshing to see those kind of balls especially from Marvel. While I welcome Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch, I wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the film. Fantastic Four is merely a reboot that loses its steam after the first act. Coming in at just over an hour and a half, the film is a rushed piece of reject summer movie drab. The characters are paper thin and about 10 years too young for their respective roles. The visual effects are far from stunning, especially The Thing, whose transformation into the ghastly beast is something closer to a PS2 game than an actual film with a $100 million price tag. Miles Teller proves here that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr. Fantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking about. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on that cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him. Kate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get. Mara is a great actress, there's no other way about it but Kate Mara as Susan Storm is terrible and borderline embarrassing. The biggest shock here in this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head is insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is anyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is him. The film overall is too dark for Fantastic Four and too shallow for Marvel which leaves it drifting somewhere between ridiculous and not necessary...and at times, both. If there's any movie to see this summer, I can assure you, Fantastic Four is NOT it.",2015
3,This movie had potential to be bigger than the rather 'bleak' 2005 version. I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. ,2015
4,"Just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should – and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of Marvel's most famous superteam is proof of that axiom. Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.",2015
2,"I'm honestly not surprised one bit that I didn't enjoy this movie.The trailer was awful,and it was obvious the movie was only made for Fox to keep the rights to this piece of garbage. The main problem with this movie is that it tries so hard to be dark and gritty.The movie isn't gritty at all.Dark?Yes at some points,but not in a good way. Another problem with this abomination is it's pace.Oh my god,the pace of this movie is incredibly slow.I'm in disbelief I didn't fall asleep.Honestly,the films pace is so slow,it's hard to know what's going on at times due to how bored you are. Next is the acting.While I though young Miles Teller did decent,the other actors were awful.I honestly feel everyone,especially Kate Mara,was miscast.It seems to me as if every actor was bored,but hey so was the audience! Another problem is the villain.I don't have much to say about Doom,besides the fact that he was forced into the film for the sake of having a villain.He wasn't threatening for even a second;He was just a joke,like the film itself. Lastly,the film is a set up for films to come.It's obvious it is,so Fox can keep the rights.From rumors out there,it's trying to set up sequels,which is true,and it's trying to set itself up with the X-Men Franchise,which I hope not. Overall,the film was an atrocity,just like it's predecessors,and the only good thing was probably the CGI.Then again,it wasn't even that amazing.The CGI wasn't as good,as say,'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. My rating is a 2/10,and it'd be a 1/10 if the CGI was a tad bit worse.",2015
5,"I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one. ",2015

1,"I would like to start by saying no. Just no. Oh my gods No! Josh Trank, I assume your name is short for 'Tranquilizer', yes? I cannot think of a single thing that can save this film. Kate Mara, you are gorgeous and a wonderful actress and I admire your work and, most importantly, I hope this willfully awful thing has not destroyed your career.",2016

8,"Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave it a shot anyway.",2015
5,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you're watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold.",2015
1,"It is almost impossible to imagine that in 2015, as movie audiences experience the golden age of superhero movies that there can still be crap like this. Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of awful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even a simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some resemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the plot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering that synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't even have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie doesn't have a ""genuine"" plot, that been the case with some other superhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or provide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe five minutes of some actual ""action""' and even that was happening, it was absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the film to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy one-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it ends up being a boring, uneventful, cliché, and yes crappy letdown. So we've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time with Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous scenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX superhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness that at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable. Instead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The jokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the interaction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by now you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A movie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to be called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier Fantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as an embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were wondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman & Robin. :0",2016
1,"Fantastic Four(2015) Starring: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Tim Blake Nelson, Reg E. Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker Directed By: Josh Trank Review CHANGE IS COMING. When I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider- Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him. Comic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X- Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?! Four young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. They use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said ""No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect"" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you. In this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is............. THEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!",2016
1,"'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early 60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting, earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never seen a good adaptation.",2015
1,"One thing I loved about the comic is the relationship they have with each other. Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human Torch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top of that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers! In a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to tell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster such as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all of the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad movie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its story. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all, but that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual protracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman Begins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat thanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen, powers are given, heroes are captured and we jump forward a year inexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in that time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation – heralded by the return of Doom – appears out of nowhere and we're into a rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the destruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the most measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was written for an audience with a severely short attention span, constantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely interesting, but the short run time suggests key development points were actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing. Again – an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie. It's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100 minutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a coherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined beginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.",2015
10,Pitch perfect 2 is a hilarious comedy and musical movie with lovely women.amazing music and fantastic acting. ,2015
3,I hated this movie almost as soon as it started. Everything was just off. It tried way too hard to be funny forcing Rebel Wilson to have to act extra weird and quirky as opposed to just naturally weird and quirky. Becca's working at a lame recording studio while trying to tell the Bellas she's going to quit. There's like two or three new girls that I can't remember because they're not memorable.,2015

10,". . . may be stereotypical L Words, but PITCH PERFECT 2 tops its predecessor as the most harmonious A Cappella flick ever. The Germans shape up so well in the early going that their eventual showdown with the Barden Belles seems sure to be a David versus Goliath affair, fought entirely on a totally sandy shore this time. Put another way, it's the Nazi Blitzkrieg against France. At my showing, film goers were on the edge of their seats, fearing that the Na--oops, that the Germans would win, or, worse, that the Belles would be called the winners on some sort of technicality, when they had been clearly out-classed. However, due to clever writing and innovative thinking, this sequel produces a crowd-pleasing climax that seems not only plausible but well-earned. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending on the World Stage is 100% satisfying.",2015

10,Pitch Perfect 2 was a pure perfection that will entertain you til the end of the film. I rate it 10/10 for its funny humour and jokes. I laugh at the jokes and didn't find it boring. It has full of life and it gives a new texture to a musical film. Like High School Musical meets Step Up movie. The mix of music and conversation was just equal and there are no dead scenes at all. They blow us away with their opening performance and the final performance exceed to the top. ,2015
7,"I have ticked spoilers in case I accidentally include any. Overall, this film was amazing and in my opinion is worth seeing. There are plenty of jokes for all ages to get and laugh at. Some are a bit racist but nothing worse than you hear daily. ",2015
9,"'Pitch Perfect' was a bit of a sleeper hit. I hadn't even heard of it when two people I knew told me it was their new favourite film in quick succession. It didn't sound like my kind of a movie but I thought I'd give it a go nevertheless. To my surprise I found myself really enjoying it and so was quite pleased to see they were making a sequel. Sequels are notorious for losing the magic of the original, particularly comedies which seem on a hiding to nothing most of the time. However, I found myself enjoying this one just as much as I had the original. ",2016
10,"For a good all out can't stop laugh you must go watch this. I laughed so much I had stomach pains and tears in my eyes. It was a little bit longer than I was prepared for but well worth the time. Rebel Wilson was AMAZING!!! Her acting skills are on point and flawless. She is very funny and she's not afraid to try anything out of the norm. She will make you laugh and fall in love with her all at the same time. The plot and the ending was predictable because it follows the same patterns as the first movie but I still found it very tasteful and comforting. Often times sequels fall short but this one made me love it even more. I normally do not find movies with an all female cast funny but this time I was surprised! If you're wondering whether or not you should take your boyfriend, husband, brother or any other masculine man to go watch this because of hesitation that he might find it boring and nag about having to be dragged to watch this then you don't have to worry. There is a lot of male approved humor in this chick flick. I'm definitely going to buy the DVD when it comes out.",2015
10,"Hollywood has finally pulled off the greatest musical ever. The director of the pitch perfect franchise introduced a new element that is rarely found in movies. I would like to call this element 'the sweetness gesture' and how beautiful it is !. This element elevated the movie to the top by combining basic human feelings such as love, fear and anger with unexpected reactions that seek to puzzle the audience unless they become acquainted with the technique. This is embedded in each and every character as they keep responding to ordeals with humorous complexity. This makes defining each character's role partly hard because they do not expose all their feelings to the audience. The sweetness element is present between the hero and the heroin but by no means do they act conventionally. The director here defies tradition and creates a new bond between the main characters making them doubly interesting to the audience. Along with the music , which is a sheer genius, everything keeps getting interesting in the movie until the end. In both movies I was moved to tears when I reached the ending. The first time this has ever happened to me. I fell in love with the main character Becca played by Anna Kendrick. I strongly recommend these two movies 'equally' as they both present a new type of comedy and even acting, which explains its immediate success.",2015

No to mention, I bought the Pitch Perfect BluRay from store just so that I'm not behind with the Pitches while PP2 is still promoting, therefore I got a free ticket from Fandango to go watch PP2, again, and I can't believe that I laughed just as much as the first time!",2015

And I didn't know Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld could rock a tune, but she'll definitely leave you impressed.",2015

Having won three national championships in a row they are invited to sing for the President. After Fat Amy (Wilson) does something that embarrasses them, they are not only kicked off their tour, but also in danger of being forced to disband. Their only hope to remain a group is to win a world championship. I have to say that like most everyone the first movie took me by surprise. The movie seemed to come out of nowhere and combine hilarious comedy with a movie that is flat out fun to watch. That reasoning both helped and hurt this movie. The sequel could not sneak up on anyone and the expectations were higher for this one, for me anyway. That said I have to say that even though this wasn't as good as the first one this one was still very very funny and another really fun movie to watch. Higgins and Banks are amazing as the announcers and the movie is almost worth watching just for them. Since this is a sequel there isn't a whole lot to say to convince you to watch or not watch but I will say that if you haven't seen the first one I would check it out before this one. You may be surprised like I was. These movies are very funny and knowing that a lot of it is improved makes it that much funnier. Overall, not as good as the original, but not a significant drop off either. I recommend this. I give it a B+.",2015

I love every single part of it. I'm not sure if you guys are going to love this movie or not but if you love dancing and singing, I bet you'll love this movie so much and you won't regret it after watching this movie. ",2015
10,"I give this a 10 not because it was flawless. It was far from. But, because it surpassed my expectations AND was better than the first (IMO : I've heard differential opinions.) Usually I avoid giving 10's because usually I give 10's to films I believe everyone should see. Which is not this. If some horror fanatic asked for recommendations, I would not recommend this. But, this is different. This one is a film I honestly believe is the exception (I won't say only, because I've given 10's to films before) because : I was laughing through almost all of it. In my opinion this was bigger and better than the first. The beginning was HILARIOUS. Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins were even funnier in this one than the first! The script was more in touch with the characters rather than the first when it was super rushed. (Besides Stacie, Jessica, Ashley and Jesse who were in it notably less.) They introduced a new BELLA who is HYSTERICAL (Flo) And they had great music. (Including Jessie J's 'Flashlight.) Overall, if you're a fan of Pitch Perfect... Please see this.

8,"I was getting pretty sick of those jump-scare-there's-something-lurking-in-a-dark-corner style movies like Insidious and the Conjuring. And Guillermo Del Toro must have thought the same thing because Crimson Peak is a gorgeous looking Gothic style movie with awesomely designed sets which have an incredible amount of detail to them. This adds a great dark and brooding atmosphere to the film and alleviates the need for these aforementioned jump scares. The story is well written and has great characters played by Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and other well cast actors. Unfortunately it got only moderate critical reviews and was also somewhat ignored by the audience in favor of Goosebumps no less. Damn kids, they ruin everything! wink emoticon",2015
8,"Guillermo del Toro is a director and artist whose films fall into two distinct categories: big budget English language blockbusters like ""Hellboy"" and ""Pacific Rim"" and lesser known, low budget Spanish language horror films like ""Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"".

3,"I have just watched this movie and it was a terrible disappointment. I loved other Del Toro's movies, but this ones feels totally empty. The film is a visual feast. Gorgeous locations, wonderfully lit serve as the background for the tale. Fantastic shots and good acting would make you think that this is a good movie. But it is not. The plot is so cheap, that you can tell what is going to happen since the first frame. The evil characters are so cartoonish that you can see their next movements from miles away. The ""good"" character is so bland and pathetic that you never have a real connection with her. In fact, as you can see where the film goes from the beginning, this movie is a total bore. Do not waste your time and watch ""The Devil's Backbone"" instead.",2015

And Pacific Rim which is a bit smarter then your average blockbuster.The new film from the acclaimed director does not disappoint, but is not for everyone. The story follows a young woman that suddenly loses her father, but at the same time finds the love of her life. But as always is not as simple as it seem, she moves in with him, and his sister and that would be the end of it, if not for some supernatural things that start to happen. It's not as simple as I explained, but I do not want to spoil the movies plot, because you should see the movie knowing as little as you can about it. ",2015

All the main characters in this movie are rich and you will realize why once the movie culminates in its climax. And then there are the ghosts. Now I have to admit that I have seen ""better"" ghosts in other horror movies because the ghosts in this movie look out of shape and straight out of a child's horror story book. ( Once again if you watch the movie carefully you might actually be able to infer why the ghosts in this movie look the way they do) BUT I won't deny the fact that the movie has it's spooky moments, some of which are extremely creepy. Moments like these get a horror movie going.",2015

And all the supernatural elements added absolutely nothing to the story except the running time. Every single supernatural element could have been cut from the film and the story would be unaffected. That's just bad writing in my opinion.",2015
4,"I'm only guessing but it seems that movie critics are getting 1) younger and 2)less well educated than earlier generations. Certainly the hack writing in the London Evening Standard seems to qualify on both counts and reinforced my theory when she stated categorically that Crimson Peak is not based on a classic novel. Maybe not but it is definitely a rip-off of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall Of The House Of Usher, albeit del Toro allows the house itself to remain standing but does mimic Poe's classic in featuring a crumbling mansion inhabited by a brother and sister who enjoy an incestuous relationship. Even the period is close - within sixty or seventy years of Poe - so it might have been titled The Serious Tilt Of The House of Usher. Apparently it's had mixed reviews which means more or less than a percentage of critics are happy to swallow del Toro's bulls**t.",2015
2,"What a disappointing movie. It starts promising - a few motives, characters, conflicts, sumptuous period detail (if all a little ""clean"" and theatrical if you know what I mean - everyone with perfect teeth and makeup and speaking like a thoughtful scriptwriter). Then gradually you realise that everything that is glaringly obvious and predictable IS actually what is happening - and its a long, painful process watching it play out just as you expect it to. There's nothing to make you go ""ah! That's interesting!"" whatsoever. The ghosts look incredibly CGI and therefore not scary at all, but more to the point they had absolutely no point or function - clearly just shoehorned in (perhaps after the original draft?) as a way to make it ""horror"" and more marketable to the teenage market. Jessica Chastain is always watchable, and the film looks pretty colourful, but that's about it.",2015

2,Not ever having seen a Gothic Horror film I went into this completely unaware of what I was letting myself in for.,2015
2,"The plot telegraphed everything so you know what is going to happen way before it does happen. The character development seems interesting, for about twenty minutes... The supernatural parts are brief and rather pointless. The decor and costuming come off as of only mild interest and the house itself... more pathetic than anything else. The acting was stiff and rather lame. The villains come off as incompetent, not particularly menacing. There is a small element of steam punk to it that feels thrown in for no particular reason. The landscape around the house was not spooky at all, but rather dry and sterile. Del Toro seems to think throwing in a bunch of insects adds something. It does add something, which is to make you wish you were watching a Peter Greenaway movie for real, instead. A Stephen King TV mini series would beat this by a country mile. Save your money.",2015
6,"Guillermo del Toro is that kind of superstar director that brings audiences to the seats no matter the genre of film. Much like Nolan, Spielberg, and Tarantino, Del Toro draws fans to see the next visual spectacle he brings to the screen. Make no mistake about it, Crimson Peak is an awe to see on the big screen, especially in IMAX. Unfortunately I think the marketing team hurt Del Toro's film this time around. The trailers were centered around this house and the ghosts that supposedly haunted it. While I loved the trailers for what they were, they didn't properly represent the movie as it actually is, which is most definitely a Gothic romance.",2015
1,"I'm sorry to say this, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Nothing about it makes sense. The plot is silly, the script seems hacked together, the acting is wooden. It's not scary, it's not romantic. The FX look nice, but aren't used effectively. Same for the sets. I guess the clothes are nice. The whole movie comes across as the plot for a puzzle style video game. It was successful in giving my wife and I something talk about all night, though we had not much nice to say about it. ",2015

8,"We are experiencing a New Golden Age of Television. But, relax, ""Zoo"" is not part of that renaissance you will not be vexed by conflicted characters, charged with remembering convoluted back-stories, or tortured by the moral ambiguity of the main plot. Consider ""Zoo"" an absolution, a get out of high-minded television free card. In other words, bring a bowl of popcorn or a package of Twizzlers: this is ""B"" television at its best: nature gone wild on a global stage (without much gore, thus far), attractive actors, plot holes big enough to swallow a rampaging giraffe, and just enough suspense to bring you back. Having come to ""Zoo"" without any expectations, I'm giving this high marks for being just entertaining. I imagine it will tell its tale and disappear from our memories like those Saturday afternoon serials of long ago – in that regard, it will be very successful.",2015

Leopards carrying human bodies away faster than a motor vehicle. There's the bad naughty chemical company that caused everything to go wrong of course all multinationals are bad and will cause the end of the human race because lets face it that's their aim because they will be able to sell their products to the animals, silly but predictable plot line. Pride of male lions what? Say that again. Silly. The wolves kill everyone in a prison yes that's right all those secure doors and gates and isolation areas and the wolves get to every single person in the prison even the armed guards who don't seem able to shoot the wolves. Beyond silly. Oh they started a fire in a store room that opens all the doors. Very secure prison, not. The cast run all around the world collecting samples but wait they don't need those samples just one in Africa.

And then bats in Antarctica really??? Only an uneducated idiot could be gullible enough to believe that a bat with almost NO Body fat or Fur could survive for more than a few minutes outside in Antarctica.

Idiotic nonsense, pseudo science that a sixth grader wouldn't buy: seriously, the lines explaining what is the mother was so stupid it made me laugh for hours. Actors are bad, really awful. I was wondering why they bother picking a French actress and other actors that speak French like a Spanish cow to realize it was just another out of fashion French bashing: The team was set up by the bad guys... If U like stupid comedy, re watch Friends 'cause zoo is plain stupid. Sine IMDb tells me my review is too short another lines.

9,"I was shocked by all the bad reviews, but to each his/her own. First, I just love the very premise of this - that after years of torture and abuse they have had enough. However, unlike Planet of the Apes, this goes on a much greater scale as they cannot speak, but can communicate. It also involves numerous species on a global scale, from our beloved house cats to lions in Africa. These animals are thinking, plotting, strategizing - and the theories behind it are not so far-fetched. ",2015
5,"spoiler alert...So they went to a village that was attacked... went into the jungle and got attacked..were tracked by lions... returned to the previous village, didn't pick up any weapons or set up a barricade but instead made bad coffee while they waited to be rescued... come on CBS just how little respect do you have for your audience. Why is a guy who has a rifle with a scope on it such a terrible shot and will you just go ahead and kill some of the animals that are attacking the humans or are you worried about a boycott from PETA? Who set up a rule that a review has to have ten lines at a minimum? My review of anything could be that ""it stinks"" that s my review. I understand keeping it short but to require more words than necessary to get your point across is ridiculous",2015
5,"Zoo has a simple concept of animals rebelling against humans. Enough is enough for them as they randomly converge on some tree or attack random passerby. It has merit since with both viewpoints from savanna and urban locales simultaneously detect anomalies. Unfortunately, there's not much interest sparked by the human characters while the animals certainly can't carry the show by themselves.",2015
1,"This show would have had some potential if it wasn't for the constant coincidental ability of the 5 main characters to always somehow know the answer all the time to every problem they encounter.

1,How this show has a 7 star rating is beyond me.,2017
9,"What is wrong with everybody? The majority of the reviews that I have read are complaining and criticizing everything about this show, recommending that no one watch. It's FICTION. So, yes, there will be factual inaccuracies and the ""science"" won't be possible in real life. It's not a documentary. It's not reality TV. If you expect everything to be spot on, then you clearly do not understand the concept of ""entertainment."" When I'm watching educational programming, I expect the writers and the producers to check their facts. They SHOULD make sure the scenery matches the supposed location, for example. This is NOT educational television. Watch some classic black and white shows and you'll see what entertainment is supposed to look like. ",2015
1,I read the book by the same name and thoroughly enjoyed it. From the very first page it had me hooked. The plot was at least plausible so when I heard there was going to be a TV series based on the book I was pleased to have something to watch over the summer that wasn't a reality show.,2015
2,"What can I say? The first episode started with kind of an interesting bang. Unfortunately the series just went downhill from there. The writing/dialogue is childish and delivered by the 3rd rate cast like a bad melodrama...the acting is simply dreadful. The directing is, well, your typical bad television directing. HOWEVER, there is a silver lining to this...like another recent, extremely bad show, ""The Witches of the East End"", Zoo is so outrageously BAD that it is incredibly entertaining. You sit glued to your seat with cocktail in hand (which you kind of need to get through and episode) and waiting for the next hokey situation so you can be stunned by how ridiculously it's resolved.",2015
1,This is hopefully a children's program.,2016
1,"James Patterson no longer writes novels and he is no longer an ""author."" He is now a producer of books who hires people to write them for him. He isn't a good producer, however, because the hacks he pays are unimaginative and untalented. All this applies to Zoo the novel and Zoo the television experience. Ridiculous plot, bad writing, absurd action, and silly all around. Not one character in this trash behaves as if they were remotely familiar with Africa, animals, or common sense. Not only does this horrific bomb insult the viewers' intelligence, it shocks them senseless with its utter absurdity. James Patterson is just the head of a book factory, so we don't really expect much from him anymore. The days of Alex Cross are over. But CBS? The executives there must hope Patterson's name alone will attract ratings even if the awful source material they paid big bucks for has resulted in a show that's complete garbage. Patterson must laugh hysterically on the way to the bank every time one of the books he ordered written hits the bestseller list. When CBS bought this, he must have split a gut laughing. Oh, well, the chumps keep buying bad books he didn't write and will most likely send the numbers through the roof watching this, CBS' very own version of Masterpiece Theater.",2015
1,"The reviews of Zoo on IMDb raised my curiosity about the series, as it was obvious that some people really loved it, whilst others hated it with a passion. So I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, it turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. For me, since I live in Africa, the most disappointing this was that the portrayal of the apparent location (Botswana) was sad, laughable, embarrassing and abhorrent all rolled in to one. I just checked through previous reviews and noticed that others picked up on the same thing. The producers are clearly not bothered enough even to make the slightest effort to make things make sense. I get it that this is fiction - great. Still, as others have pointed out, you would never even dream of having an American-based series where you announce in bold letters - Mexico - to highlight the location, and then show a picture of the Empire State building and have the rest of the scene in NYC. It's crass ignorant rubbish. You wouldn't accept it in North American. Don't allow it to be acceptable elsewhere. Although I just go to the first episode, I see that there is a similar issue with the Slovenia scene. Please, people watching these programmes have gone through Kindergarten level geography, and these kinds of gross misrepresentations just go to spoil what would otherwise be a really interesting fiction tale. For Africa, just do it in Kenya, call it Kenya and use Kenya actors for the required characters. Duhhhh! As it is, we have BOTSWANA highlighted as the location, pictures of hunting on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro (in Tanzania, but also seen from neighbouring Kenya), and a West African (probably Nigerian) actor with a strong West African accent speaking broken Swahili. Honestly, it was just laughable. Of course, the bad guy hunting the rhino is an Asian (in cahoots with the bad guy African cops!). Ironic that the real hunters, such as the guy that slaughtered Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe, are mostly from the US.",2015

Lots of cliché relationships, secret government organizations, big bad chem corporation, Obsessive journalist. unassuming skeptical animal doctor who starts to believe, etc.",2015
1,"Looks like someone took all of the pseudo-science fiction tropes and threw them into a blender. But this is based off of a book from the CEO of schlock ""co-authoured"" Inc., James Patterson, so we shouldn't be surprised. But despite being badly directed, badly acted, and with an effects budget that limits the production to a handful of cats and one lion, there is a racist undercurrent that is most insulting. In Africa, Africa, who are our heroes? The functioning alcoholic Bostonian with Daddy issues and a blonde Frenchwoman who just happens to be on her safari honeymoon, sans finance because (gasp!) he cheated on her! Gosh, I wonder if our grizzled Zac Efron clone and Ms. Really- Bad-Accent will become an item? And will she tell us how she was able to put on her makeup with such precision after swigging half a flask of bourbon, falling down an embankment, and being nearly eaten by lions? Did I mention the plucky reporter who was just fired from her job because of her blog? And the misanthropic animal scientist with the heart of gold?",2015
2,"Good idea for a show, but as an African was disappointed that the show perpetuates the assumption that Africa is just one huge ass country. From the Savannah scenes its clear that this was shot somewhere in Tanzania yet they keep showing 'Botswana"" at the beginning of each scene (these two are thousands of miles apart). With the little Swahili used in the show this area cannot be Botswana, they don't speak it there. At the end, on the credits pages, one of the extras is listed as a ""Kenyan Policeman"". So technically the scene is in Botswana with a Kenyan policeman but shot in Tanzania?? Would you have a Florida scene, shot in Michigan with an NYPD cop? Doesn't make sense at all! A little research (that you can find even on Wikipedia) would have gone a long way. Very inaccurate!",2015
2,"So I have tried giving it a fair chance, but now they show that animals also get superpowers, yes that's true superpowers.

But this must be the worst equipped bases ever it runs solely on solar panels with no battery or diesel generator as back up, because Antarctica is know for its sunny weather (there are weeks without sunrises there). But along comes these bats from Japan where they took down and airplane in the last episode, which means they have travel around 13000 km in a couple of days, an since the average distance they fly in a night is normally max 80-100 km the most be super fast, or these bats took of over 150 days ago and took a trip with no sleep to Antarctica to kill to females that where there for some reason, by cutting there power of by sitting on the solar panels ?, really And how are these super bats surviving the temperature I do't know, even in the summer time on the warmest part of Antarctica its still only 15 Celsius, and if two humans indoors in arctic gear froze to death why did these bat not die ?, not to mention that there wings would dried up, put hey they could have come in the summer but thanks to all that ice that reflects the sun Antarctica is pretty much the worst place for an nocturnal species ever to be in when there is sun light.",2015

1,"You know, they actors are great. The plot isn't. It presents science as something that is arbitrary. It presents scientific ideas as stupid. It presents things as true that demonstrably aren't. In the minds of some people this might be fun, but others don't know how to distinguish these stupidities as truth, which devalues science as a source of truth about how the world actually works. There are many films and books that use science as a background that don't need to present things we actually know about as stupid or wrong. The writers of this show apparently think we are all 12 years old in free play, in which anything can be anything, rather than living in a world where some things really are the way they are. This is a bad remake of the Birds, or Frogs, or Swamp Thing, or Shrews, or the Island of Doctor Moreax. These produced a vision of doing harm to our understanding of how this one works, without making light of the real one, without treating us as stupid. This makes no pretensions about knowing anything, or producing a vision of something possible. It does actual harm to our understanding of science by making it seem that science is whatever we want without evidence. All we have to do is have a strong feeling and it is true, as if we could nullify gravity by thinking. Shame on whoever produced this piece of trash. If I could give a negative rating I would. Phah. I don't even fart in your general direction. Idiotic drivel only for those who failed 4th grade. Worse than a c movie which we would only watch for the bodies of the actors. Filth.

I liked it so much I decided to get on and leave a review in hopes that it wouldn't get canceled by the anti sci fi overly critical critics. It is a major challenge to take on a show set in space with the ships, technology, characters, plot, and in this case they are on the right track. Just look at the ship set, it's awesome. After seeing the typical bad reviews I am convinced there is a plot to keep sci fi from staying on the air. The bad reviews sound like the people who originally hated firefly and look what happened there. It's nice having a new show without vampires, zombies, and high school drama that you can turn to when you want something in outer space with FTL.

It has a great potential to become a good show with good mystery around every corner. It wasn't the best pilot but after watching the 2nd episode I honestly can't wait for the 3rd one to come out...Backstory , the characters are OK, and it is weird to read bad things about the special effects . Even though I always want the best special effect in the shows I am watching , it was never really that important to me , if everything else was good... Take some of the older sci fi shows that didn't have thhe best special effects , but you liked them for everything else. The weird thing was that the special effects here are much better than what was said in some bad reviewa. In short - It is a good show for all",2015

There is no need to go over-the-top with the plot line as it stands.

9,"This review comes after the show is well into it's seventh episode. When I first started watching this show, I was put-off by how terrible the intro video looked. Yes, in terms of special effects and post- production quality, I felt this show was severely lacking, and even more so because it's a sci-fi. But as the episodes kept coming, the show subtly but compellingly tugged me to appreciate the intricacies of human interaction, of the many mysteries on that ship, and the good pace of character development. The seventh episode had a good dose of humor, some of it childish but mostly enough to elicit a good solid chuckle. Without getting into the plot and other details, I would suggest you guys start watching this show, it has quite a lot to offer.",2015
9,"How long it's been since we saw a spaceship based show which is not a spin off, sequel or reboot?

I can see Joseph Mallozzi learned a couple of lessons from SGU failure, so now the producers of the show try to balance action with a slow story development and hints on how far and global the story can go... It's great, the ending of episode 4 boosts imagination - jump clones, a killed emperor, potential intergalactic conflict... And the humor, it's not dumb... So if you like intelligent Space sci-fi with bits of mystery , you're welcome...",2015

8,"After the first episode, I'm personally rating it as an 8/10. The premise is quite promising with its formula, especially with veteran SG-1/SG-A writers at the helm of the show. The premise though reminds feels a little bit like Firefly and a little bit weirdly enough, a bit like Defiance(though subject to change after 1st episode). One of the MAJOR concerns is that this show is featured on SYFY and as many of us know, the network has been known to low ball budget shows and hinder some of the potential of otherwise great shows and writers. After episode 1, I am definitely intrigued to see what this show has to offer . The show is based on the Comic book of the same name and writer and has some praise to it.

It pops with a multi layer story with a cast that is awesome. From the Raza to the photography, from the concept of clones to travel to the Android, it all adds up smoothly and logically. I didn't even estranged the death of One, as it is an interesting twist to the plot line. I know some are keen on having a joint venture with Killjoys, but I don't think they are quite the same. Let's see where this plot takes us, and what will it unveil a little further before thinking in messing it up.",2016

Won't call it an outstanding all new Sci-fi-Show but it pretty much fills the gab that many other canceled Sci-Fi-Shows have left in the market. Dark matter has a little bit of Star trek, Firefly, Andromeda and eve Red Dwarf in it. That's nothing new, but I guess that Dark matter doesn't want to be something band new. Dark matter only wants to transmit basic, sample, straight-forward Sci-Fi to it's audience. And for this I love it. Hope it won't be canceled that soon. Got potentials for a few more seasons but the characters have to be developed a little deeper for that. So long and may the force live long and prosper, so say we all.",2015

I found B.L. hauntingly beautiful, and this story a tapestry of feelings unfolding; especially her surrender versus flight. Her encounter with H.F. from out of her past is powerful for both characters. And I thought the resolution of her immortality was quite a pleasant surprise that made me smile after being teary-eyed most of the movie. The last few minutes of the movie are especially beautiful if you are a romantic like me. This is a sweet movie that you will really enjoy.",2015

9,"I have been looking forward to this film because of the story line. There are so many things to like about it - the flashbacks are well done and so believable. The costumes are so fun to watch. I do not think I have seen Blake Lively act before and I was clearly entranced by her performance. She carries the film so well and is so quiet and well done. I liked the actors - Michaeil Haisman is gorgeous and believable. Harrison Ford - so happy to see him in a movie again - and he is also believable as the father of Ellis. Elen Burnstyn is delightful. This story could have been presented in such a different manner - director Lee Toland Kreiger got it, and it is beautiful story-telling. I love the last scene.",2015

8,"The acting in this I cannot fault, though Adeline has a very low range of emotions given the material, her demure persona is a sign of the times in which she was raised.

7,"Ever wonder what its like not to age? I know I have, but I never can grasp all the factors that come about with immortality, especially in terms of love and relationships. Well my friends, we have the good fortune to get movies to give us a glimpse, and this weekend it is in the form of the Age of Adaline. This romantic drama has some potential to be an interesting romance story, but one must heed caution when watching trailers. So let's get started on this review shall we. ",2015
5,"At the beginning the movie seemed quite interesting, but then the plot happened. It's not that i expected the most beautiful love story of all time, but at least something decent. The ""scientific explanation"" was silly and unnecessary. I mean lightning- how original, nobody ever explained super powers with lightning. A magical potion or door would have been more believable. Then- the police officer who calls the FBI immediately, just because a 45 year old women looks like 30-35?! I mean come on.. It's not like she was 70 at the time. Even without plastic surgery, there are people who look younger. And even then, nobody thought, that it could be a typo or something? Then, the love story with the long- hair- guy. It's just stupid. I can't even say it's clishee, because clishee would have been better. They tried to make the characters seem interesting and their dates so original, but the lack of chemistry, emotions and a normal human conversation made those scenes look completely implausible. I would rather see them go to a date to a fast food restaurant and talk about politics and the weather than this. What do we know about the guy? He's a stalker, he likes unusual girls, because- omg, she's reading braille and isn't blind, that's so cool! And he's rich, of course. His lines to hit on her were like he found them by googling ""interesting facts to say on a date"". It seemed like they didn't talk about anything personal, anyone's life, world views, likes and dislikes, but about random knowledge you find at the end of the newspaper. And she..after living for such a long time, it would be nice to see, not just how much random stuff she learned, but to see her wisdom or the typical old people's grumpiness, but no. She acts like she's 20 and just started her life and didn't figure out how to live with someone- not because she will loose him, but because the FBI scared her with their unsuccessful one time visit. And after a week or a month she loves the stalker guy?! The love story with her father was way better and had some real potential. I mean the guy named a comet after her! If that's not romantic..no. I would have rather seen her run away with him. But the young looking pretty girl can't ditch the young pretty guy for an old guy. And then, the electricity undoing her super power just because electricity is magical- what to say?! The last scene was hilarious- the narrator really had to explain to us, that a grey hair means she's getting old :D Just in case stupid people won't get how brilliant the movie really is. As far as the lines and chemistry goes, the narrator could have talked through the whole movie and explain to us how they loved each other and how touching everything is.",2015
8,"The Age of Adaline isn't the first movie to tackle the subject of immortality, nor will it be the last, but what it does is offer something a bit different to your typical movie about immortals. For one thing, no vampires here. For another, while most of these types of films are seen through the eyes of a male character, it's a woman by the name of Adaline Bowman (her birth name, although she goes by many others) who is the focus this time around, which allows for a unique spin on things. Time and again we've heard from broody vampires and such how much of a ""curse"" immortality is, but here it's applied to what is essentially a real life scenario - albeit with one slight supernatural element. It poses the question that if you were just a regular human being, except you outlived everyone, what would your life be like? Here we see that it would be a life on the run, leaving everyone you know/may get to know behind for fear of them finding out your secret or becoming a specimen in experiments. You'd never be able to settle anywhere - which is exactly Adaline's dilemma. ",2015
9,My initial interest in the movie wasn't very high from the previews but the offer of a free screening lead me to study the preview a little more. I decided to order the free tickets if they were still available in my area. I was blessed to get 2 tickets. I was pleasantly surprised with the film throughout and my friend enjoyed it also. I liked it so well that I plan to buy the bluray when it comes out. I like to collect nice romances for future reviewing. I initially thought a few characters didn't look much like their parents but as the movie played out it was not a problem for me. Their acting was so good I could over look that. Blake Lively did an excellent acting job in the movie. I was impressed with Harrison Ford's acting in the movie. In summary I enjoyed the movie very much. I enjoyed the clean crisp time period photography. I would consider this a good date movie.,2015
7,"No wise man ever wished to be younger."" Jonathan Swift  Walking into the cinema... Intrigueing is the word that comes to mind  with The Age of Adaline. It is hard to categorise this film. Is it  fantasy, a romance, a philosophical exercise, or a combination of them  all?   Overall rating: 3.5 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Big Questions value:  4 stars  What would you do if you were to remain 29 years of age for the rest of  your life? Some might think that this would be ideal, while others  would consider this to be a horrifying experience. This is the life of  Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively). Through a series of fantastic phenomena,  she has remained as a 29 year old for eight decades. She has to  experience a life of solitude and separation, because she cannot age  with those that she is closest to in her life. Her life is veiled in  secrecy, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a  philanthropist who ignites her passion for life and unknowingly he is a  link to her past. What seems to be an innocent weekend away, becomes a  crossroads for the truth and a chance for her to decide what she will  do with the rest of her life.   I will admit it, a good romance is a joy to experience. Romances may  not be my favourite genre, but they have their place in cinematic  history. The Age of Adeline will not win awards for groundbreaking film  making, but it does fill a void in this year's celluloid offerings. It  is a good, straight forward, romantic journey. Even with the fantasy  element of eternal youth, this was a good film for the romantic at  heart. It can get a bit sappy, but it is a satisfying tale. Indie  director Lee Toland Krieger (Celeste and Jesse Forever) is able to  incorporate a level of geekiness to satisfy any male audience members  without sacrificing the primary storyline. His measured style develops  a believability of this inventive story. Kreiger hearkens back to the  beautiful romances of bygone eras, where subtlety and magnificent  cinematography aid in delivering a beautiful romance. With the same  level of measured performance, Blake Lively is excellent as the lead.  She portrays the melancholy of a woman who lives with the mind of an  elderly woman trapped in a perpetually young body. She allows herself  to fall for Ellis, who is an old soul in a young man's body. Huisman  brings a depth of character that makes this relationship right for both  of them. One of the challenges of decade jumping films is the ageing of  key characters, but Kreiger manages to make this element convincing.  From the excellent supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Ellen  Burstyn to the young actors that portrayed them in earlier decades,  these characters were convincing and do not cause any distraction.  Admittedly, the unfortunate component of watching this genre is the  anticipation of sappiness or the inevitable tragedy. The Age of Adaline  is a romance and contains some of these inevitable trappings, but due  to the melancholy of the lead character and the control she has to  shoulder for eight decades, this tale contains the bitter sweetness  needed to move beyond the syrupy elements of many good hearted  romances. Which leaves the verdict that Kreiger delivers an appealing  and enjoyable romance.   Before the opening sequence, this romantic adventure provides some of  the best discussion points in recent cinema. In our era of desired  eternal youth or the desire to merely appearing young, The Age of  Adaline allows the audience to see the curse that this gift can be on  anyone's life. It helps that Blake Lively is an attractive woman and  manages to not experience any disfiguring accidents in her one-hundred  and seven years. Which could cause a level of disbelief in the story,  but does not become a consideration. Her pain seems to come from being  attractive to most men, but she cannot allow herself to respond to  their advances and she is only is allowed to be close with her dog,  Reggie. Thoughts move from eternal youth to eternal life. Her  melancholic spirit is shown in her awareness of this life that she  remains trapped in. There has to be more as death occurs all around  her, but she seems to be eternally trapped. She maintains a mental  strength to not seek death as the answer to her pain, but death does  add to the shadow that envelops her life. If that is not enough,  Adaline has to lie and say farewell to all who come into her life. Her  life is a moral conundrum and explains why she seems to be a shell of a  woman throughout much of the film, until she is eventually allowed to  tell the truth and live the life she never thought she could live. The  Age of Adaline proves to be more than a romance. It is a philosophical  journey packaged as this year's romance.   Leaving the cinema: Is it ironic that a film of ageless beauty would be  packaged in the film making style of yesteryear? This felt like a  romance from the past, but will meet modern audiences with a fresh view  on romance. This is a film that can bring out the romantic in anyone.  It may have a sappy element, but it is satisfying and may make the date  night dinner conversation deeper and more meaningful.  Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this  film? 1. Would you want to be forever young? (Ecclesiastes 12:1, 2  Timothy 2:22) 2. Is an eternal soul better off being in heaven than on  earth? (John 14:2, Philippians 3:20)  Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system",2015
8,"First of all I wasn't really intrigued with the outline of the story so it was not my first choice to watch. The unrealistic plot of a woman not aging didn't appeal to me. So I was pleasantly surprised at how the movie started, the beautiful narrators voice in the beginning and especially Blake Lively mastering classic American silhouette when knocking on the door of a young man who has new papers for her. Beautiful! I do not know who coached Lively in her very stylish performance, but it was such a joy to watch. The New Years lunch with her daughter Flemming was done absolutely awesome. Although the age of mother and daughter was reversed, it was absolutely stunning to watch Lively rocking a classic, perfectly groomed look that wouldn't have been so out of place in the 1930s, mothering over her daughter, almost admonishing her how to hold her cutlery properly ... amazing, stunning and absolute perfection. The love story however lacked some intensity and left some questions open in the end. Heartbreaking was the anniversary speech of Ellis father. Truth or etiquette?",2015

6,"(First of all, let me add that there is a minor plot-spoiler in this review, which I have left 'til the penultimate paragraph: I point that out since I normally try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but this was a significant (but personal) contributor to the overall enjoyment of the film).",2015
8,"My wife and I saw The Age of Adaline on our 32nd anniversary. We both enjoyed and appreciated the acting talents of Blake Lively, Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford. The love story still lives on and this movie underscored the fulfillment of a life worth living and the thrill of rekindling love, a powerful human desire.",2015
1,The story sounds interesting — but bear in mind it is not. It's a sh*t but the beauty of the protagonist made it a good sh*t. ,2015
9,*minor spoiler regarding the introduction of the movie*,2015
1,"So I went to this movie with no expectations. The first two minutes seems interesting. Adaline seems like she is going to use her years of living to provide some wisdom to the young man making her IDs. Then it takes a nose dive from there. For someone that has lived 107 years, she never truly experienced loss. Of course she loses her first husband but you see that in a brief flashback that had an unnecessary narration added to it. Then you meet the creepy stalker type Ellis. Not only can the actor not give a believable performance, but there was absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters. Another flashback happens to the 1960s and we find out that Adaline loved someone else and I thought well maybe that's what they are building too that she is still holding on to that love. Spoiler, No that's not the case. I was really disappointed with Harrison Ford's performance also. The whole movie reminded me of bad SyFy flick that is aired on a Saturday afternoon. Save yourself some money because you won't lose yourself in any performance of this movie.",2015
1,"This is quite possibly the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time, if not ever. It is also among the most tediously boring I have seen. I was attracted to it for two reasons: the plot premise - a woman who never ages - was rife with possibilities, and it had Harrison Ford, one of my favorites. As far as the possibilities of the plot premise, fuggedaboutit. We might have had some considerations of the meaning of mortality, but no. What we wind up with is a warmed over soap opera plot centering on mundane romantic issues. Vast stretches of the movie are taken up with vacuous and empty dialogue. I have never seen Blake Lively before and I certainly in future will avoid any movie starring her; her acting, as Dorothy Parker said, ""runs the emotional gamut from A to B."" Then we have the portentous voice-over explaining the Deus ex machina events that bookmark the story. As someone once said, if you need a voice-over, your script is inadequate. As far as those two ""miraculous"" events, we might have accepted the first one if there had been some serious content in the movie. As it is, with all the vapidity we have seen, the second ""miraculous event"" seems simply ridiculous. This is a pretentious and boring movie on which you should not waste your time. For a far superior - and riotously comedic - take on the issue of mortality, watch ""Death Becomes Her."" At least you'll have a few laughs, unlike this dog, which leaves you with nothing,",2015
7,The movie The Age of Adaline is a good film overall. It is about A woman Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) who becomes fundamentally ageless around the end of the 19th century due to a horrific incident. ,2015
8,The 'Age of Adaline' movie is as sweet romantic story of Adaline Bowman who stops aging after a life threatening accident making her immortal to the ravages of time but not invincible.,2015
8,its what one call perfect love story not one of those cliché we get to see these days with cheesy script and aaww! moments drawing strength from the same melodrama draped in a different clothes. its hard these days to see a good idea turned into a fantabulous movie.it does not matter whether u are romantic movie lover or not it will surely touch you.like other master pieces it has flaws it rushed a bit it could have focused on initial parts elaborating the a little bit but still its good to watch u'll surely enjoy it ,2015
7,"The Age of Adaline if not great, is a good movie that skims romance gorgeously. The concept though a mere fantasy is brought to life with a scientific outlook and a background narration that doesn't properly explore the how. The theme of the movie is romance and it tries to stay on it with Lee Toland Krieger's beautiful direction. The drama is great to watch owing to exceptional performances packed in by Harrison Ford and Blake Lively.",2015
8,"I am not fond of fantasies--which seem to be all the rage in film these days, but this one is different, because aside from the eternal-life premise, the rest is very believable. Two romances are intertwined artistically and the acting is very good.",2015
3,"A lot of reviewers seem to have found some meaning, purpose, and message in the story. To me it flat lined right after the first auto accident and read like a low end novel. The characters never seem solid or fully developed, Adaline's background is just suggested in flashbacks, and the majority of the story takes place in the here and now. And then every major turn in her life is so predictable you want to just laugh when it happens.",2015
10,"Gaah! I can't wait for the next episode! It is building tension ju-u-u-st right: Creepy, heart rending, asking the big questions about life and love and what constitutes consciousness, in other words it just couldn't be better. It also feels like perhaps it actually is building towards a specific future point, rather than just bumbling along and making stuff up as it goes. I am very excited to see where they're taking us, and how current loyalties may shift..? (I hope so!) Very well made, very well acted, just well-crafted in every way. Who said the art of good Science Fiction is dead? It seems to be experiencing a renaissance right now in response to all the boring 'miserealism' of recent times - huzzah!",2015
9,My wife and I operate a three episode policy when deciding to watch a new show. With all the great TV out there it can be hard to choose what to watch and not every show has a great start but develops into something memorable. As a result we always wait until we have DVR'd at least three episodes before watching the first. The other reason we record three is if the show is good we will want more immediately. Humans however left us wanting more after the third episode.,2015
9,"I expected this series to be an ""I Robot"" lite, but in fact I am impressed with the first episode both from its acting and the completeness of this initial 'view' into an alternative world. Keeping my fingers crossed it will maintain this standard. Although I know this was adapted from a Swedish series I'm deliberately staying away from it for now. The opening episode certainly seems to have captured the sense of atmosphere and something impending that Scandinavians do so well. With a cast which is more than able to add some heft to the 'human' side of the story - it was equally gratifying to see the 'synthetics' pull off the difficult balancing act between machine behavior and enough 'emotional' content to set the series up for some dramatic juxtapositions. Although there is a small level of ""adult"" content I think its use, given the use of technology in our own world, was both relevant and all too believable.",2015
10,"This is meant to be an extremely positive review, however it might not sound that way. This first episode was so disturbing I had to take a break. When I came back and finished it I had tears I'm my eyes from the disturbing feeling it invoked. This is not normally something I seek out in entertainment. But this is so well done, I simply can't avoid it. If I described the premise created in the first episode, it would sound tired and old; all the questions about artificial intelligence and it's rise equaling the fall of mankind. But somehow the writing, and story, and especially the actors create something new and exceptional. What happens here is inevitable someday. The questions are will we survive?",2015
10,"The first episode of AMC's new series ""Humans"" is ambitious, covering a lot of ground in a broad subject--artificial intelligence (and the nature of humanity).",2015
8,"First, this is the kind of series the Brits have shown a knack for, riffing off normal life situations into something creepy and unexpected. (See for example UTOPIA, the original UK version, also reviewed by this scribe.) So even though this is a clone of a European show, it is a natural for English audiences.",2015
10,"Wow! I watched the first episode and at the beginning I was a little skeptical. By the end of the episode not only was I thoroughly impressed, I was totally hooked to the show. I knew I had to have more episodes and I couldn't wait for episode two.",2015
9,As someone who has raved about the original 'Äkta Människor' for some time now I was keen to see the remake. Set in a parallel time line synthetic humans have become commonplace in both the workplace and the home. The programme explores how regular people react with them and how a group of them with modified sentience develop in their own unique ways under the loose leadership of a human. If it follows the original which looks likely then expect some really weird stuff. It also follows the 'life' of an unmodified outdated and somewhat faulty model called 'Odie' who's elderly owner cannot bare to part with him as he has a shared relationship with his dead wife and reminds him of her. Having seen 'Being Human' recently which was dreadful I was prepared for the worst but was surprised to see that the latest version may even be superior to the original. I look forward to the next episode.,2015
9,"Normally I wouldn't recommend a show after only the first episode, I'd wait until it was over. But this new series has the makings of another well-done morality play. Not many of those these days. It's ""Frankenstein"" meets ""Fahrenheit 451"" meets ""The Boys from Brazil."" Lesson–just because we can do something, doesn't mean it's a wise thing to do. The perils can be legion and often unpredictable. The story begins with an overwrought dad buying a synth, which is a synthetic human, to be their housekeeper. His wife is none too pleased when she comes back from her business trip. He is played by Tom Goodman-Hill (Mr Grove on ""Mr Selfridge""). His wife is played by Katherine Parkinson (Pauline on ""Doc Martin""). William Hurt plays an older man who can't come to grips with the fact that his synth, whom he treats like a son, is wearing out. You'll want to watch it in order. It's a tele-novel. Catch up with On Demand or online. I find that with AMC shows, if you watch the airing prior to 10pm, it is cleaned up as far as language, nudity, etc, if there is any.",2015
8,Humans is an unexpectedly great show. The reason for this is that it's understated in the technology an emphasizes the humanity. The cast are all from UK and mostly unknown and it allows us to get to know the characters more. Gemma Chan who plays Anita/Mya led me to this series via her Twitter. I first saw her in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.,2015
9,Well these synthetics cost no more than a car - can cook - garden - iron and engage in pretty lifeless 'conversations'. Quite frankly it might be better to splash your money on the new Mazda MX5 this Summer and have some real fun.,2015
8,"In terms of production values, this show is more an eight (by British TV standards, I guess) than a nine. But I give nine because of its timeliness -- its prescience as well as its social and cultural value. Because like it or not, thinking machines are here already. AI and artificial sentience are real. It's just beginning and it won't be long before ""synths"" are an every day fact of life, not just as a disembodied Suri or Suki in a cell phone, but as lifelike robotic machines with human-like intelligence. We won't know if they're sentient or not at first. But they will surprise, then shock, then scare the s**t out of us, just like the synths do on this show. Mark my words -- perhap only a vox clamanti...",2016
5,"I really enjoyed the first two or three episodes of Humans on CH4 but it then seemed to grind to a halt and very little of interest happened in the second half of the series. I overlooked the fact that no other technology had advanced with these futuristic 'Synths' and I thought that most of the actors did a pretty good job given the story they had to work with but I really don't know where this show can go from here and I'm surprised that it got a second cycle. It all unravelled when we discovered that DI Voss was in fact a Synth, despite behaving completely human until that point and then sporadically going into 'robot mode' afterwards. I'm still puzzled as to why there was a Synth detective - she didn't seem to have a special role or any relationship with anybody higher up in the police/government. Maybe I got confused or perhaps I was just losing interest but the final two episodes were a real struggle to get through and I will not be coming back for more. I really would have liked to had watch the original Swedish version before this.",2015
4,"Spoilers. Maybe it's because I've read science fiction extensively and watched many sci-fi TV shows and movies, but Humans is nothing new. They made robots, tried to control them and lo and behold some of them are sentient and don't appreciate being treated as slaves. Dull.Very shallow treatment of what it means to be human. Of course, they had to have the real humans beating up the synths for fun and profit, wow, never thought of that before. The dialog was tedious and things don't make sense. Why can't the old man keep his malfunctioning synth and have the mean nurse synth? What's up with giving over control to a mean nurse synth anyway? No one would think that's a good idea. If they're going to make a nurse, make a nice one, why make it mean? I was so looking forward to seeing Colin Morgan and even he was disappointing.

This series should have (shoulda) got off it's ar** and got moving instead of slow pedaling. This series would have (woulda) developed far better entertainment value IF the main domestic characters weren't so unlikeable (and why are teenage family members always portrayed as intelligent brats?) and IF the 'synthetic' characters weren't so ridiculously predictable, one-dimensional and unbelievable. Without some character to root for and a villain to despise most stories don't work well, and frankly the characters in this show are just too flat and boring to care about. Another promising 'sci-fi' TV show down the drain due to poor scriptwriting and limited director skills. I would suspect that it has a very limited budget. I give it three for trying.",2015
9,"As a science fiction TV show, it strongly evokes this theme by how well the story is portrayed as seen in one episode. I hope it continues such interesting development. It showed many interesting A.I. questions, particularly showing a broad emotionality.Anita and her interest in having a child is so deep i am more than amused. It was shown exactly at the time the interview people were talking about synths not being able to reproduce. intriguing so far. The One synth Fred who is back in the factory,does he wake up? Like Anita getting back at the sour/vindictive/bitter/resentful laura. I wonder what her ill feeling is based on? did her mother run away with a synth? why is she hiding her photo album? Also like the acting behind Mathilda's angsty rebellion,feeling outsmarted and direction-less by the very nature of synths and taking it out on Anita. wowser. At least three synths experienced unnecessary human cruelty,it begs the question can humans ever be ungainfully nice.... It also does a brilliant task of questioning our own humanity and understanding consciousness. cray of the backboard.",2015

2,"... well, it certainly FELT LIKE 400. I take my hat off to Channel 4 for taking such a potentially interesting — and, like it or not, important — subject and making 336 minutes of painfully dull television from it. The plot was dull: basically a bunch of dull and not-very-likable humans bickering endlessly, intercut with a bunch of dull and not-very-likable synths running around and hiding. The script was dull, hackneyed and cliché-ridden, as well as being full of colossal holes and WTFs. The acting was lacklustre (even William Hurt phoned his performance in), flat, dull, and at times pretty amateurish. The supposedly sentient synths were as dull as the non-sentient ones, who were as dull as the humans. The last 2-3 episodes, by which time I was really only watching it out of habit, made precious little sense. All in all: dull. (I believe I may have mentioned that once or twice already ...)",2015

9,"If you enjoyed Parks and Rec, the Office, and 500 Days of Summer, watch this show. ",2015
10,"If you've seen Aziz's latest comedy special this show will not surprise you. In his latest special Aziz was both funny and clever while at other times vulnerable and thoughtful. I would say his humanity, warmth, and huge talent for being funny come out in this show in spades. And as it should since I'm guessing it's only a slightly different version than real events he's gone through on his own. There have been many comparisons to Louie and I would agree that the style of the show is similar but what makes it different is the completely different perspectives that Aziz and Louie have. Even in his stand up there's this boyish charm and innocence that Aziz has and that comes out in this show. Many of the funniest moments are Aziz being boyish and charming. He's not convince all is evil, he still sees the the best in things but is sometimes nagged by pessimism and doubt whereas Louie tends to think everything is crap and is pleasantly surprised when there is humanity left in people. All and all this show is well worth watching if you want something that is mostly funny but also has some poignant and touching moments. I agree that the last 3 or so episodes take a less funny and more drama tone but I don't think that's a bad thing. I felt like this show almost felt like an Aziz diary. He wanted to portray the things he has obviously thought about and bring to light certain social issues that have given him pause. Lastly the supporting cast is awesome. It's nice to see Eric Wareheim actually be funny as the Tim and Eric Awesome Show is pretty awful in my opinion. You got to see him be much more of a human here and be really funny while at times poignant as well. The rest of the supporting cast was great too. Although Claire Danes being in a couple episodes felt a bit odd. Regardless a show worth watching and perfectly worth binging on!",2015
9,"Master of None is the story of 30-something Dev, played by Aziz. It's a bit like 'Louie' for a generation that is not yet convinced that the world is a shitty and sad place. A generation that is being told it can do an be anything but has no idea what or who that is. It's a show that tries to leave out most of the usual banalities and predictable entanglements but to tell stories that feel real, unscripted almost. ",2015
10,"While a huge fan of Aziz, the first episode left me unsure of what to think of the show. I perceived from the trailers and marketing that it was a hilarious comedy, which it is, but at the same time explores deep subject matter, while never getting too serious. I absolutely loved this series and watched it within almost 48 hours. Every single character is absolutely hilarious and perfect for this show. The blend of comedy and drama that makes you question your own thoughts and path in life is definitely inspiring and left me with a pain in my side from the laughter. This show will stick with me for a long time and I will revisit many more times.",2015

Thats all you need to know.",2017

1,"So I thought I'd enjoy this show. I expected it to be a little less poisoned by the typical American fake scenery, casting and unrealistic all-over experience that is in almost every movie or series these days. I guess they kinda accomplished that here - people and actors are not all supermodels, the writing doesn't seem to be too much about somebody doing something super irrational and then realizing it in the end - what every comedy seems to be about these days. Well, in MoN still the answers that are given seem very much extreme and are very in your face. But that is not the worst part - it's the acting - aziz is OK, I guess - his parents always wait half a seconds too long for their turn and then say their text with a kinda fitting face - but they often overpronounce and -act. In general it doesn't seem like I am watching real people talk - it seems very obvious, that everybody is waiting his turn to talk and then says his part. Too often in a very unbelievable manner - they never fall into each others words, or just say something casually - it's always like they were auditioning for a role. I guess everybody these days is used too the unrealism in movies and television. I am not - and in MoN it is just too obvious too me, that a LOT of characters (in the second episode basically everybody except Aziz Ansari) have a hard time acting. And I guess together with the effort to make this series very relatable it just miserably fails in my eyes. I had to stop watching after episode 2 - so sorry, if it gets wayyyyyyy better after that - I am just not in for it. fail. Can't believe this is getting such good reviews - generally i am really frightened by the standards people have these days - are 80% of people using their phone while they watch anything and thus not really noticing the s*** that is going on on the ""main"" screen??? WTF.",2015
1,"I like Aziz Ansari and enjoyed his stand up specials. This show, however, is just terrible. The jokes are forced so hard and the acting is dreadful. I get the niche of dopey comedy shows where the point is less about production value and acting and it's about the comedians more ""hanging out"" and getting into funny situations. There are hilarious ideas for jokes in this show but they are almost never executed well. Many just make me cringe. It appears many others love it, and that's great, but I just cannot get past the poor acting and contrived situations and poor execution. As a side note, it's very cute how he got his actual parents to do this but his mom is just SO BAD!! His dad has some natural ability and knows how to deliver a joke but it's odd to me that Aziz is one of the worst actors on this show...just didn't expect that. Anyway maybe they can get that figured out in later seasons or perhaps that's the charm of the show and it's just over my head. Either way, cannot imagine I'll be watching it.",2015
1,"I do not know anything about Aziz Ansari. I watched this show on the recommendation of my co-writer. I was looking forward to seeing a contemporary TV comedy. I suppose it was contemporary, but comedy is the last word that comes to mind. Garbage, however, does. ",2015
1,"Master of None is a Master of Race-Baiting and a Slave of Political Correctness, not funny in the least. Focusing so heavily on race does not a funny show make.",2016
10,"Season one was quite alright and definitely above average but season two is what really made me give it the full ten stars. Master of None does not seize the easy way out which lies ahead when it comes to comic relief, cliché plot twists or predictable character development. No, it truly touched me with its ability to pay intense attention to detail. The fact that we get to follow Dev on an entire taxi trip with no further plot developments contributes to the extremely high level of intimacy that this series offers. We get to follow the characters at a very real level instead of the usual ""love story on the top shallow level""-type of stuff that comedy shows usually offer. The semi-open ending just adds to the awe. Do they get each other? As far as we know, yes. Now they have to figure out what is next.",2017
9,"The first season started of really awkward and after first episode, I thought about stop watching. I still gave it a try and it kept on impressing me. The second season is one of the most creative pieces I have seen for a long time. The smooth conversational style and the imaginative expressions relating to daily lives makes it easy to watch. Had a lot of fun watching the first two seasons. Hope to see next season.",2017
4,"I quite liked season 1, but season 2 is such a drag. The first episodes are set in Italy and seem like an excuse for the production team and actors to go on a free trip. And an opportunity for Aziz to show off his Italian with an over-the-top accent. The whole style of filming in a so called Italian style is pretentious for this show and it adds to all the Italy clichés that are already in this show. ",2017
6,"So perhaps this series should be commended for capturing millennial zeitgeist but Aziz Ansari's acting is abysmal - flat affect, no physicality, etc. How he was Emmy nominated for his acting is inexplicable. Most scenes feel like a beginning actor's workshop. I am a big fan of Louie and he knows the power of bringing in characters (for multiple episodes or cameos) played by great, established actors who are both deeply affecting and funny - Ellen Burstyn, Jeremy Renner, Charles Grodin, Parker Posey, etc. - as well as accomplished, less well-known actors who portray Louie's family (including the brilliant young actresses who play his 2 daughters). ",2016
6,"Well it's not the hilarious comedy that I expected, but one of those laid-back slice-of-life things. The sentimental mood of it reminds me of movies like ""Jesse and Celeste"" or ""Boyhood""; you know, the kind where it's all about *Life* and there's no exact plot, just events happening and people talking. The story just floats along from one situation to another. Conflicts are just bridges to cross: they come up and resolve without fanfare. It's watchable and entertaining at times, but it's not something I would want to see more than once. ",2016
3,"Seriously. Such a shame. Season one is nearly brilliant. The first episode of season 2 was great; on another level of television, like something you would expect to see on AMC. But darn, the rest of season two is running on flat tires. After episode five, I didn't even want to finish watching the series but I was in to deep by then and just wanted to finish it off, much to my chagrin. So what's the problem you ask? The dialogue. It is like the nearly every character, regardless of race, age or gender have to same dialogue. It is like what's his name is living on another planet. Dialogue between characters is so smooth and artificial, and I wouldn't mind as much if it was funny but it isn't; so I have no choice but to pay attention to the paper thin plot and hipsterific character exchanges. Nothing smart, just 100% artificial fluff and filler. What a disappointment.",2017
6,"You can pretty much sign me up for anything Aziz Ansari has ever been in. I remember when my friend first showed me his first stand up act. I nearly wept with laughter when he told stories about his goofy cousins. I watched all of NBC's Parks and Recreation (2007) basically for his character. I say these things only because I want to convey that, normally, I would be the last person on Earth to criticize Aziz's work; however, I found his new Netflix original series Master of None (2015) to be incredibly disappointing. ",2015
5,"I wanted to like this, and expected to based on the positive reception its had. Unfortunately, whilst it's sweet and cheerful, it's also entirely unfunny. ",2016
3,"I suffered through five episodes before deciding I'd rather spend my time watching grass grow than another episode of this. Note, I did blow air through my nose repeatedly a few times and even almost lol'd once. I personally would enjoy the series if it was like be forced fed liberal broccoli. The incessant, gratuitous liberal overtones became unbearable after a few episodes. Oh, that and the lack of being funny. That with some of the awkward, under-performing miscasts added to my increasing boredom per episode. I did not even pay to watch these and still felt like I was owed money for suffering through it. It was like eating seven-layer dip of liberal with stale Cheetos. I'd rather watch Pluto Nash.",2015
7,"After skimming through some of these reviews, I'm not sure what people were expecting from Knock Knock. It plays out like a cross between No Good Deed and The Loved Ones. The story isn't original of course but this is Eli Roth's take on a home invasion thriller and it's refreshingly sadistic. Two strangers knock on Keanu Reeves' door, he invites them in, their sociopathic tendencies start to peek through, and things escalate from there. The acting is largely impressive. Keanu comes across as silly at times but, for the most part, he fits the part of the innocent dad and he bounces off the chemistry of the two female leads very well.",2015
1,"I'm a rare poster here at IMDb. Good movies? They get enough praise without me joining in the chorus. Average films? There's usually enough people on each side to adequately debate the pros and cons.

7,"I loved Eli Roth immediately after Hostel 1. I knew this man can deal with human nature. I follow his work since then. This feature shows a man taken at his soft spot when he was not expecting any trouble. Sometimes people give in to temptations of much lesser magnitude. He made a wrong decision, he got what was coming. But the ending! Imagine he is an idiot and cannot explain his wife that he was attacked and framed. Imagine his wife is an idiot, did not believe him, took the kids and divorced him. That would be the suggested ending, won't it. What seems to be a moral story leaves an unfinished business. I want to see the architect taking cold revenge. Track down the ladies, think a little, and turn their lives into a living hell. They'd played their game and had had their fun on account of the architect and other people; now they have it coming. Give us the revenge sequel!",2015

1,Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu Reeves and am so disappointed with the story line and there is nothing thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie. Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and two hours of precious time.,2015
1,"Holy sh*t do I hate Eli Roth movies. Ever since Hostel and Cabin Fever I've found his films to border on the unwatchable, and yet I watched this one (and fully plan to watch Green Inferno), knowing that I wasn't likely to enjoy them. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe I just like spreading the Eli Roth is not very good gospel to anyone who will listen. So, what about this one?",2015
1,"After spending a Saturday night watching a film I've been looking forward to see since I first saw the trailer, honestly I feel robbed of an hour and a half I'll never get back.

1,"This is the first review of a movie I've ever written and I wouldn't usually do this, but felt the need to advise people to steer clear of this movie. It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie. I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so that I eventually lost interest completely. The ending was one of the biggest disappointments and left me with feelings of relief that it was finally over and feeling like I'd just wasted the last 90 minutes of my life. Avoid this movie at all costs!!",2015
1,"I first watched this film by renting it from a Redbox. The rental is only $1.50 and honestly the amount is so little I usually do not care if I rent a bad movie but, I really feel like I actually wasted my money on this film. At first this film seemed good from the trailers, it seemed like a good twist on a thriller and it really piqued my interest. So when I saw it on Redbox I was excited because I haven't seen a good thriller in a long time. So when I got home and popped it in my player after the first ten minutes I knew this film was going to go downhill and had no end in sight. Keanu Reeves usually plays as a strong, smart, and capable character in his movies; not a wimpy, stupid, and really a down right moron. This fact alone disappoints me because I am a Reeve fan and a little part of that admiration just went away. The film started well, with him sidestepping their advances and being seeing the girls as young and stupid, but in the bathroom scene apparently all of that goes out the window just because they're naked. Wow. As the film progresses it seems to become a slight against men, by portraying them to be these idiotic, misogynistic, and sex on the brain oafs that will do anything as long as there is a piece of ""meat"" hanging in front of them. This becomes overly clear when the character, ""Genesis"" has the line, ""You all are the same"" and ""They never say no."" I understand that this is a film but to create something so bigoted and dogmatic and think that it is acceptable; it really begins to bring to light the morals and philosophies of the writers and producers. I know that this will probably make some folks mad or angry but flip the situation around. If it had been a woman on the bed getting raped by a man, I'd put money on the fact that this movie wouldn't have made it beyond the notepad of the first writer. We as a society tend to have double standards that usually benefit one party or another, and I completely understand why this happens and why it is bad. But to campaign against this problem and to become a more accepting society, movies like this are not helping whatsoever. I am not trying to suggest censoring literature and media, but to have a film that is so one-sided is very detrimental to furthering our society to become rational and fair. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film. It will only make the viewer angry and frustrated. I feel this film will only please one particular group of people, the more radical feminist groups. More liberal feminists will probably be angered by the movie because it really puts a bad name on the movement, by making it seem that this is what feminism hopes to prove. The intention of my review is not one of contention and hostility but to give my opinion and hopefully shine some light on the reasoning behind it. I just ask that before you go and fire away a comment or a reply to this review, to try and see it from a different my perspective, a 22 year old man that is still trying to understand how the world works. Thank you. P.S. I use the word ""feminism"" and ""feminist,"" not as a derogatory remark or slight, but just as a descriptor of a noble movement or person.",2015

I could have stopped it after 10 minutes only but I had read the review where it was said that a ""good"" twist is in the store at the end. OMG!...nothing... this movie is nothings and I pity Keanu for producing it. How can he be so dumb to produce a movie where he did the worst acting of his career or for that matter worst of the worst actor's. Both the female characters were so dumbly irritating that you want to kill them while watching the movie.

I used to love Keanu but u can tell him and the movie are very poorly directed, the script is the worst thing, nothing of what happens is justified, nothing makes sense and stereotypes of the lovely family are always used. I'm a filmmaking student and although I love Keanu reeves and I think of the stuff Eli Roth has done isn't that bad, I highly recommend you not to see this movie, instead watch something worth your time. The girls aren't bad but their acting is not as good, some of the stuff they do seems premeditated and poorly executed, the camera movements are simple, they didn't give that much thought into them. The traveling that marks the beginning keeps coming back many times, couldn't think of a more original way to introduce the perfect family eh? The last line is the worst thing, the kids could use more coaching but the thing is, the entire story is poorly written and executed, so if you ask me, the problem doesn't start with the cast, it's the started since the preproduction, the script like I've mentioned, is poorly written so whoever authorized the money for this movie is the one to blame, they clearly haven't seen actual good movies before. My advise is, don't see this film, don't waste your time,go watch something worth your time.",2015

The plot was promising but that was just all. I lost in facebook, on my phone... while trying to keep attantion to film. There were really messed up scenes without a point, if Eli Roth tried to tell some story and wanted to make a point I can easily say he failed hard this time.

4,"Despite the warnings from negative reviews and low IMDb rating i watched it anyway... I've always liked Eli Roth mainly for his near show stealing appearance as 'The Bear Jew' in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and his movies, though never groundbreaking for me, offered playful b-movie fun. His efforts here seemed to diminish after the initial creation of suspense. Once we move to the second act the script loses any credibility and little is left for creation of further suspense. It's almost as if the idea was to get Keanu to behave somewhat like Nicholas Cage in OMG mode. That idea i couldn't shake and ironically it became what kept me entertained, imagining cage instead of reeves, which wasn't too hard as Keanu seemed to channel the spirit of the rage cage as if he were possessed by him. Don't let my mention of cage fool you, the acting in this movie is sub par, if Keanu isn't The Wicker Man he's the wooden man and the girls act like female villains in a made for TV batman movie. In summary; I found a few things Keanu said in a serious monologue quite laugh out loud funny and the use of a popular pixies track at the end credits reminded me of a student movie using cool music to be cool. All it did was remind me of it's already iconic use in one of my favorite movies. The movie was just bad enough to enjoy it's shitness or i'd have not sat through it. Avoid this if you get offended by crap movies but I'm almost recommending you to watch this for the points I mentioned for your own curiosity. The movie stuck in my mind enough for m to waste time writing this review, i wonder if that was Roth's intention for the audience or he actually took this movie seriously.",2015

It preserved a great play but it wasn't much of a film, whereas John Crowley's screen version of Toibin's novel is as close to perfect as we are likely to get.

She breaks free from her shell and shines in this radiant, unfamiliar realm. Returning to Ireland for what she hopes is a brief stay, Eilis both sees through and is seen in a luminous and different light. Both worlds, New York and her Irish home, now pull the new and improved Eilis in different directions.",2015
3,"One of the marks of a bad movie is unmotivated or out of character behavior. That pretty much sums up this whole movie. The main character is set up to be sweet, loving, quiet, and innocent. She is forced to emigrate in order to have any kind of future. Then she goes to a dance with a new girl at the boarding house and treats her horribly for absolutely no reason. She remarks, based on nothing, that the girl is ""awful."" I guess the awfulness must have been edited out. ",2016

3,"Every year when the best movie nominations are revealed, I watch all of them to decide if they are worthy. I was surprised that Brooklyn is nominated because I have no idea why. The acting is good from every one involved. Saoirse Ronan as usual shows her limitless talent. However I have trouble caring about the events in her life or the characters. These events are meant to be extraordinary - migrating to a foreign land, overcoming homesickness to thrive in the new environment, falling in love and marrying someone from another culture as well as losing a beloved family member back home. It seems like they are just glossed over lightly and at a rather slow pace. There were some inspiring words narrated over but it still feels like a TV movie rather than one for the big screen hoping to win big awards.",2016
3,"Colm Toibin is a great writer. Nick Hornby is not. I have enjoyed some of C.T.'s novels a great deal (In fact ""The Heather Blazing"" is a favorite of mine.) I like his genteel style in such work. The performances here are fine, or better than fine; it looks lovely: the color palette, the costumes, the scenes and scenery all make for a fine backdrop. Where it fails, and it is a major failing, is that it says nothing of any real worth about the migrant experience. Eilis (Saoirise Ronan) is shipped off to NYC through the assistance of her thoughtful sister and a kindly priest. (In a good performance by Jim Broadbent as Father Flood.) Up until an easily predicted plot development the difficulties faced by our heroine are a bout of seasickness, the need for 30 seconds training in her new job as a shop assistant, and a touch of homesickness. While I'm happy to see women succeed, there would have been far more dirt under the fingernails of all of these women. Apart from the minor matter of losing her virginity, Eilis could indeed be the sainted mother of God. It all suffers from Nick Hornby blandness. Everything he touches turns to bland. My advice: stay away from his cooking and, more importantly, his ""creative"" projects. This is not meant to be an art house atmospheric enigma, nor is it, but it fails to involve solely because of a threadbare plot that avoids detailing the threadbare aspects of lives led by women who were, in reality, the working poor.",2015
4,"The movie doesn't look like 50s, both cars and Brooklyn, Ireland, dancing, poverty, motivation, costumes, atmosphere itself. Sometimes it looks like 30s, sometimes 60s. Poor Ireland turns into blooming country for a few months. The plot is very nice, wide space for creativity, but... It looks like authors never felt need nor duty nor passion. Life of wax people with synthetic problems and feelings. The movie pretends to be a human story, but it is far away from real life, real people. False feeling. It looks like authors read no book only comics, never fell in love, they can make love only. Ultimately, poor realization strangled nice plot. As for me, of course. You eager in anticipation with plot for all the movie but the small mistakes and disappointments then and again spoil your impression, but you calm yourself down, OK, it's just a small lapse, let's enjoy it... I'm surprised the movie was nominated, it is not Cinema, it's just a piece of pop-culture, cliché, comics.",2016

It's about family, respect, hard work, the things we love, ambition and most of all romantic love. It is a treasure trove of a movie about the the things we value most in life. It's perfect for a Sunday afternoon and brings enchantment. If only there were more movies like this one.",2016

Unlike his fellow actors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent.

Ronald of course, unlike his brother, is not the suave charmer and rascal type, but has more of a polish wrestler look and demeanor. This makes for some light comedy when Ronald is shown to be one of the few men that can't look smart and elegant wearing a suit, which incidentally only make him look more silly and distinctly out of place. Ronald also has to rely on fools luck more than skill and intelligence to save his ill conceived ways of handling things. At the start of the movie for instance, he manages to raze two entire blocks of houses whilst trying to perform the simple task of taking out a bad guy with a snipers rifle.

It's a total fake, an unoriginal, a fraud. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at, but it's empty. Absolutely empty. Where it tries to be clever, it comes up empty. Basically, they slapped the name Bond on it, said that everything was somehow conveniently connected to one another (how brilliant! sigh :/ ) and dress it up with beautiful cinematography. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Predictable and whenever they tried to make something significant, it ended up being oh so silly.",2016

7,"Whether you like Daniel Craig as Bond or not, you can't deny he has been an integral part of the series' highest points. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you'd expect. An attention-grabbing, tense opening fight scene, a lovely title sequence (whether the song is good is debatable), and an elaborate sinister plot surrounding James Bond that puts him up against his inner demons more than ever. Does it surpass Casino Royale or Skyfall? Definitely not, but as far as reintroducing the villainous organization SPECTRE into Bond canon after 40+ years, the film does more than a serviceable job, giving us a stylish action-adventure to boot.",2015
1,"James Bond or Agent 007 has been since it beginning in books and specially in movies the standard male fantasy. He can seduce any women, practice every sport and win, drink as much as he wished and never get drunk, live all the fashion. drive the best cars (preferable Aston Martin) or any other vehicle (like jets, Helicopters, boats) and fight and kill any enemy without regret. The Regan era; and sadly most of his followers; consider the emblematic British spy as a piece of crap and decided to moralize it; both Timothy Dalton movies kisses required an AIDS test. Luckily Pierce Brosnan's Bond was somewhat a back to the origins. He smiled and made jokes;, seduced women, drink and kill when necessary; but some Hollywood asshole and a few absurd critics; decided it was becoming a parody and wanted for Jason Bourne style. A killer without personality looking for vengeance. ",2015
3,"I was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even the action scenes were quite lacklustre. I think it had nothing to do with the big budget special effects but more to do with the emotionless performance of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Whenever anything exciting happened he acted like he didn't even care. He may do this every day but I can't believe it would ever get old or boring. In between the action scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not surprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a mindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's no passion.",2016

Entertainment, as we all know, comes in different shapes and sizes; it can be smart, profound, intellectually stimulating and so forth – or it can just be escapist fun. Now what kind of entertainment you expect from a James Bond film is up to you; as for me, I go with fun. Regrettably, the last three 007 instalments fell a bit short in that department (at least for my taste), and since I expected this new film to be more of the same, I didn't exactly get my hopes up.

It's a terrific Bond film (more Bondish than Skyfall in a gloriously preposterous way)that has the equals in production values, score (Thomas Newman mixing Skyfall cues with new ones fits well), direction, performances and the brave narrative decisions taken in its script. But let me say this in advice: it may not exactly reach the same smart and complex, deeper and meaningful way achieved in the very personal Skyfall.",2015

But if your genre is the action or you are a Bond fan-boy (but a real fan-boy, the one who knows that Bond is a dark killer with a great sense f humor as well a troubled human being and not just a fantasy and silly spy in silly missions with a handful of gadgets) then SPECTRE will be a total feast for you.",2015
10,"As a die hard fan of James Bond, I found this film to be simply nothing more than a classic. For any original James Bond fan, you will simply enjoy how the producers and Sam Mendes re-emerged the roots of James Bond. The roots of Spectre, Blofield and just the pure elements of James Bond that we all miss even from the gun barrel introduction. This film deserves higher ratings in my view. I don't want to spoil the film , but I am finally glad the writers brought back the roots of James Bond. A true fan nothing more nothing less. I don't know what else to expect from a James bond film and Spectre does just what I originally expected in a James Bond film. It opens a whole new extension to have many more films to come. The cast does a superb in their roles and many salutes to Christopher Waltz in his enemy role.",2015
10,"Spectre may be receiving mixed reviews within the community, but I believe that this is simply credited to the fact that Spectre differs from the other Craig Bond films like Casino Royale and Skyfall. This latest installment, in my own opinion, tips the hat to the old Bond-style of action that we loved in most of the earlier films. Granted it is not as brash as say Goldfinger, with character names such as Pussy Galore. But it doesn't exactly fit into the box of Daniel Craig's films either. This movie tells a story. It isn't just nice suits, and cars with beautiful woman surrounded by flying bullets in front of the canvas of a massive explosion (even if this film does boast the record for the largest stunt explosion in movie history). No, this movie gives us some nice character development. With a nod to the many years of Bond that has preceded Craig. It was a nice feeling to think that as a Bond fan across the the entire Franchise, that I was privy to some knowledge and little Easter eggs that maybe some of the newly converted fans (those that have joined the agency only since Craig assumed the 00-status) may not have caught on too. The only downside I could see anyone pointing out with this film is maybe the length of the film. This film could be reviewed as a rather long one, especially to those who might lose interest trying to involve themselves in a story that started back in the days of Connery. But if you are a fan of the entire franchise spanning across all 24 films, maybe even some of Flemming's original novel, then Spectre is a must see.",2015
10,"Finally we get to have some fun in the Daniel Craig era. Skyfall was good but underwhelming. This brings back the punches of classic Bond and has outstanding performances from Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz. Not to mention Harris (who is becoming crucial and wonderful in her character development), Fiennes, Winshaw, and Kinnear. Also Bellucci and Bautista serve their roles very well. Waltz was the funnest to watch and I always pegged him for this role of Bond villain since I first saw Inglorious Basterds and boy, he did not disappoint. He eats up his scenes and eschews the sadistic egomaniac with charm, style, and class. The scenery and shooting were breathtaking especially the shots in the Austrian Alps and the Train sequence was a great nod to the ghosts of Bonds past (From Russia with Love and The Spy Who Loved Me). Let's hope for many more.",2015

1,"I own all the James Bond movies ever made, and would consider myself a die-hard fan of the franchise, but this is the sole movie of the franchise I will not be buying. Due to word limit, I will list the problems: 1. If I had paid $10 with the intent to watch an action movie and was only going for the explosions and the fight scenes, I would have been satisfied. The cinematography is gorgeous and even artistic in places, (especially the excellent beginning in the Dia de Los Muertos festivities). The fight scenes, car chases, and thrilling helicopter death rolls were very well done. If 2. I came to see a Bond film. Bond films are about James Bond (not about Bond's bosses, both dead and living) defeating villains NOT BY PUNCHING THEM INTO A PULP, but through superior skill, suave maneuvering, and of course, romancing the clothes off any woman remotely related to the story line. In short, Bond films have a plot! They don't just go ""hey, we can't write, so lets just throw in a lot of explosions from the start and maybe no one will notice!"". Oh, and along with a plot, they also had a Bond who was strong and confident. Please please stop with the mentally damaged emotionally strung out Bond all the time. Yes, Bond has always been hinted at as being haunted by the Bond girls who have died, (hence the martinis), but no one wants that to be the entirety of his character. Focus on the positive, not completely on the negative!",2015

Like the beloved fairytale, Cinderella (Lily James) is a servant girl to her two ugly step sisters (Sophie McShera and Holiday Granger) and her cruel and unspeakably vile step mother (Cate Blanchett). However, when the king (Derek Jacobi) hosts a royal ball in order to find a suitable wife for his son (Richard Madden), who should appear but that servant girl dressed in a dazzling gown and glass slippers that were given to her by her very own fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)? From the romance to the slightly altered plot, this movie was spectacular! The screenplay, although based off an old fairytale, still managed to be original and entertaining. The characters were wonderfully developed and the actors were able to play off of each other so well. As for Cinderella and Prince Charming, the romance could not be more believable. You could practically see sparks flying around the whole theater as they meet for the first time. The costumes were gorgeous and the music, beautiful. Everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job.

1,"I was disgusted by the disparaging portrayal of Cinderella in this film, and the weak role model she represents to children. Throughout the film there were frequent times when Cinderella could have stood up to her step-sisters and step-mother who bullied her. But instead she takes the rather dubious moral high-ground of ""I must be kind and courageous"". Since when did being 'kind' equate to being a dupe and a push over? Of course it all works out well for Cinderella who is rescued by her fairy god mother and prince - a great lesson to teach our children...not. With her continual chatting to animals and air-headed behaviour I was inclined to believe that her step-sisters were correct - Cinderella was a simpleton. At which point I lost all interest and rather hoped the prince would marry the wicked step- mother, who at least had a backbone. The film ended with the surmise that Cinderella was courageous (in case you had any doubts) as she faced the prince without makeup and a flouncy dress on - well done Cinderella. I too can't bear to face a man without looking my utmost prettiest and best. Oh, one last thing Cinderella - if you had really wanted to wear your dead mothers 'pink' dress to the ball, what were you thinking when you let the fairy godmother turn it into a blue meringue? Oh sorry I forgot...you have to be ""kind"".",2015

10,It's a sad truth today that complicated story lines result in low viewership for programs. 12 Monkeys arc and continuing build of that arc are the result of an overarching and very cleverly written intentionally time limited design.,2017
10,"This show continues to blow me away with how well written and acted it is. I am wondering if the title is part of the reason more people are not watching it. The movie was a strange little gem. and one that I did not enjoy much the first time I watched many years ago. It was too confusing and dark for my tastes. I re-watched it again out of curiosity after the first season of the TV show and it made more sense. The TV series starts out with the basic idea of time travel to stop a plague in the future, but it is so much more than that. Now in the 2nd season it has evolved way past that one idea. This is a very clever and smartly written show. As one who loves most movies and TV shows with time travel involved, since I was a kid and loved ""The Time Tunnel"". Over the years I have been a huge fan of Doctor Who, the reboot, Quantum Leap, Fringe, Sliders, Being Erica to name a few really good and entertaining time travel based themed shows. With so many truly bad shows on TV, don't miss this gem. I do not want to see people ""discover"" this show after it is canceled. Watch it now so we can keep getting new seasons. You will not regret it. I have not read comments from one person who actually watched the show and did not enjoy it. It is complicated yet understandable and intriguing.",2016
10,"The decision to show the complete season in one weekend was awesome. I just finished ""binge"" watching this season and loved the experience, instead of waiting week to week. With so much content to take in, it flowed better and made a complex show about time travel very understandable. GREAT JOB SYFY and the GREAT cast of 12 Monkeys. Can't wait til 2018!",2017
9,"SyFy has outdone themselves with this remake, I was expecting the typical SyFy lackluster writing and transparent acting. I am glad to say that they have hit this out of the park in my book. The story is close enough to the original that you kind of feel comfortable in the universe but changed enough to freshen it up. The actors and actresses all do a really good job. I am impressed and waiting for more! The story line feels very thought out and not just thrown together, I am enjoying the changes they made to the ""present"" time it feels more realistic(not sure of how to describe it) than the 1995 movie. The lead actor Aaron Stanford really nails the part of Cole, as does Amanda Schull as Cassie. I hope they get a series 2 and keep this going! Best show SyFy has done in a very long time.",2015

10,"Actually, It is good TV series. I love it. After second season I cant believe my eyes. and I am waiting for third season with eight eyes. I hope it will start soon because I cant wait. If you are think to start, don't think just start. Good show and there is nothing to say it is awesome. :)",2017

8,"People who have watched the movie by Terry Gilliam already know this story. The premise of a time traveler returning to an earlier period to alter future events is not a new one within the realm of Science Fiction by any stretch of the imagination. What made the movie special was a combination of directorial vision, superb writing, excellent acting, and mood enhancing cinematography - all the requisite elements for delivering an engaging piece of dramatic fiction. It was a story told well with effective pacing which reached a satisfying conclusion within the span of one sitting.",2015
8,"12 Monkeys, an amazing show. I would say it must be watched to be appreciated. I had seen the Terry Gilliam movie and was impressed and when they said they were going to come out with a TV version of it, to be frank, I was not impressed. Also, the initial trailer did no justice to the actual show (I felt that). Now coming to the show, as you know it is a show about a virus and time travel. But unlike many other time travel shows, which try to merge philosophy with the concept of time travel, 12 Monkeys makes no such pretenses. It is a straight up show with excellent performances by everyone involved. The whole concept of the movie has been captured and grown very nicely by the show's creators. I was genuinely impressed by the plot twists and turns and now I can't wait for Season 2!!!",2015
10,"One of the best sci-fi shows out there today. I have thoroughly enjoyed it from episode one. Great acting and an intriguing story arc. If you find the start a bit hard to follow just give it a few episodes and it will grab you. I loved the original movie although a little quirky at times I just love any thing about time travel but this show stands head and shoulders above the movie. I must say that we have been spoiled to have so many great shows over the last few years. 12 Monkeys will stand among some of the best. In short great show, love it and I just read that season three has been approved. I've just seen episode 13 of season 2. Blown away....",2016
9,"Sorry No spoilers, I will not deprive you. I just watched the first 4 episodes of season 3. I loved the limited commercial binge format that puts 4 45 min episodes into a 3 hour block. Basically binge watching the entire season in three nights, should be adopted for every detail oriented series. What did you think?",2017

10,"I just finished watching the Season 2 finale and I couldn't possibly get enough of this show. It doesn't matter that it's a remake of the movie, it's a completely different story. It gets better with every episode. They always keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. It's suspenseful, plenty of action, with just the right touch of drama/romance. Yes it's based on the movie, ""12 monkeys,"" but the movie is barely the beginning and, in my opinion, I'd pick this series over the movie every time. And I love the movie but there's so much more going on here!",2016

10,"It really picked up in season two, the writing, the acting and everything else, it's becoming very interesting to watch and I find myself waiting for it every week. I hope they don't go and cancel it on us, as they've been doing with all great shows lately. It's almost even better than the movie. Aaron Stafford is very sexy as James Cole and Emily Hampshire does an excellent role of being a nut case. I also like Kirk Acevedo as Josè Ramses and Barbara Sukowa as Katarina Jones, although I find Dr. Cassandra Railly played by Amanda Schull a little annoying as of season 2, although I liked her in season 1, somehow the tough act doesn't suite her. Overall great job and good entertainment.",2017
10,"Not since The Walking Dead & The Strain has a new Sci-Fi Thriller series intrigued me so much. The lead character, Cole, played by Aaron Stanford, is both a hardened hero & a sensitive being. Love the actress who plays the scientist too, Barbara Sukowa. The young doctor in the female lead role, Amanda Schull, is impressive as well & Walking Dead fans will recognize the best friend of our hero Cole as actor Kirk Acevedo. Then of course is the villain. Every good thriller needs one...and Todd Stashwick as Deacon fits the bill perfectly. The episodes are well written, directed masterfully and the pace is quick. I recommend that new viewers start watching from the pilot episode in order to acquaint themselves with the characters & the story lines. This is really a gem of a show. If you find yourself waiting impatiently for the next new episode, you know you've discovered a hit. Can't wait for tonight! Countdown....",2015

He could still wear a robe, but did it have to look like a potato sack? How can Batman really compete with Superman, seriously?",2015

Everyone is friend with each other, everyone betrays each other everyone is enemy with each other, so on and so forth. Writers block I guess. It had potential, but they screwed it up beyond repairs. Kill whoever they consider will manipulate viewers, resurrect whom they think will manipulate viewers, until there will be viewers no more. At the moment looks like they have no idea what to do with the show anymore. Now someone is powerful beyond imagination, next they fall due to some little illogic coincidental incident, action is stale, tables turn so often that I had no idea what am I watching.

In a way, the show resembles a sort of Game of Thrones / Vikings hybrid - but totally different! The acting is just spot on and the story is very intriguing. I cannot wait to see more! I've only watched 3 episodes and I really wish I could binge watch the rest. The 1st season only has 6 episodes which is a major bummer. The trailer for this show doesn't do it justice. The pace of the show is perfect and I never felt the need to skip scenes, which I often do with long, drawn out shows.",2015

AMC would be crazy not to renew this show, it has GREAT potential! This was an excellent substitute for The Walking Dead. I have to say Into the Badlands is tied with TWD as my favorite! ",2015
10,"This is a fantastic new series, and definitely binge-worthy!! Love the low-tech aspects-old weapons, swords, etc. Keep it coming! The detail on the costuming is amazing. Loved the leatherwork. The only thing missing is mail - that would work great with the period pieces and the swordplay. I found the characters to be well developed and relatable, with a good blend of traits that you both love and hate in each character. Keeps you wondering who's going to turn out to be good guys and bad guys. Great element to the plot! The location scenes were beautiful and appropriate, loved the mansions that looked like old Southern plantation settings. It worked great with Quinn's poppy plantation. It was refreshing to see the polyamorous aspects of the story, with Quinn's partners learning to deal with each other. Sad to see there was only one more episode this season. Hope it continues for another season (or twenty)!",2015

10,"This show has a great overall storyline, and the marital arts action makes for the most perfect icing on a cake. The show appeals to lovers of feudal, post-apocalyptic, story plots - while also drawing in those who love entertaining martial arts action. What is most to be liked, I believe, is that it is most unlike most other cookie cutter formula hospital and cop action dramas on TV. The only oddities in the plot line are: a) that 'the boy' needs to get cut before unleashing his hidden power; and that, after only a handful of episodes, b) one of the most interesting characters 'the baron (Quinn)' has been diagnosed with some terminal brain tumor. Other than that, I enjoy the series very much - as much - if not more than The Walking Dead. Can't wait to Watch future ITB episodes!",2015

But sadly the Samurai (Daniel Wu without personalty ,character or believable ruthlessness ) goes into God Mode and slaughters twenty to thirty bots every episode .With God Mode every episode plays out the same.

But they do have cars and bikes..!!! But eventually it gains attention with action scenes having swords, slow-motion fights and a few hidden twists. Season 1 was small (only 6 episodes), that's why it ended well. But the series need a great work in story to stay up in the chart. Currently it is like Game of Thrones with less politics, less violence, and less sexual scenes.",2016

Fast moving plot, a ton of action, great characters, and much mystery. This show is going to grow and be a ratings buster, guaranteed. If you want a real story, mixed in with action, this is your story. I am also female, one of my fears is that it would be useless, meaningless action... that is NOT the case. The action actually moves the story further and includes the story... it is not separated like TWD will do once in a while. This is great. Please try it! If AMC does not pick up a second season, please let some other channel pick it up. It will be a ratings giant, I promise.",2015

When it was on TV and I had nothing better to do I let it run and I must say after watching that first episode I was hooked ! And have been ever since this show is definitely a must watch ! If you love martial arts a good story and finally some strong female characters this is for you !,2017

4,"Let me just start by saying, the reason I was disappointed by this show is not because it wasn't realistic. I'm all for imaginative shows! However, this one just fell flat and ended up being silly. The commercials looked great and I was excited for a martial arts show with some good fight scenes! But when it comes down to it, the characters are unrelatable and flat. The main character, Sunny, is just too perfect. He always makes the right moral call and always beats the bad guys. His lack of flaws just makes him hard to connect to as a character and he's very robotic. The other characters feel very forgettable. I've been doing martial arts for years and years, so I was looking forward to some great fight scenes. I was disappointed. Sure, they look cool, but they are so recited that they lack that genuine feeling you get from old martial arts movies. It ends up being more of a dance than anything. They are also very predictable. Cronies wait their turn to attack, each one is better than the next. The hero beats all those guys, then has a harder time with the ""boss"". Just when it looks like the hero has met his match, he gets the upper hand and takes the bad guy out! Like I said, I wanted to like this show, but after 3 episodes I can't think of much reason to keep watching. The story isn't intriguing enough, I don't care about the characters enough, the fight scenes aren't what I hoped for, it just feels very contrived and silly... I like the exaggerated colors and cinematography, but the main premise that drew me originally to the show just wasn't executed as well as it could've been. An altogether disappointing show.",2015

7,"This is actually pretty funny. It's not the most sophisticated comedy, but you should know that even before watching this. Mark Wahlberg showing off his perks ... I mean comedic talents again. Also his muscles yes (for those who care). There are quite a few jokes that go below the belt (even literally), but it's all kept pretty light, if you don't mind that direction in general.",2016
3,"Daddy's Home is an awful movie with a very poorly developed storyline that is all a set up for poor jokes, and an impressive comedic cast that all just felt wasted. There are some funny parts in it, but sadly those parts were also in the trailer, so we are left with good bits that are no longer funny cause we've seen them all already, and a ton of lame, immature jokes such as watching Will Ferrell get electrocuted or a ridiculous dance off between Mark Wahlberg and Bill Burr. Ferrell and Wahlberg really weren't the stars of this movie because any chemistry that the two certainly have is thrown away with poor development, as well as the fact that both of their characters are unlikeable, it was hard to tell who we were suppose to root for, neither of them was really an antagonist or protagonist. The only two people who really seemed to enjoy being a part of this movie were Thomas Haden Church and Hannibal Buress, they did have me genuinely laughing in their scenes, and for the time they're on screen we can forget about how poor, unfunny, poorly edited and regretful this movie is. Lacking energy, heart and original comedy, Daddy's Home kills any potential it has, and you would be much better off avoiding it. ",2016
8,"I found this funnier than most critics did, but it's one of Will Ferrell's better recent comedic films, and adding Mark Wahlberg to the equation made this film a hit for me. Great laughs and simple fun. A well deserved 8/10 from me",2018
4,"Unfunny, forced and wrong in pretty much every place Daddy's Home is another stupid film starring god-awful actor Will Ferrell. I like Mark Wahlberg but my god he goes from good movies like Lone Survivor to this crap. This movie also takes logic out like that scene with the bike or the scenes with the Skateboard. The best scene from the movie was the ending where John Cena appears and Triple H Metallica song starts playing other than that the movie sucks. Go see a better comedy not this one. Final Rating 4/10 dumb and stupid in every possible way. Michael Bay's Transformers 4 had better acting and scenes than this film has in 1 hour. ",2016
2,"Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, even The Other Guys. This is the level of comedy I expect when I watch a Will Ferrell movie - insanely witty, funny dialogue, with some of the only truly funny slapstick scenes around thrown in to boot.",2016
7,"'Daddy's Home' is the second collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the first being 2010's 'The Other Guys'. There's no doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even though no one could deny he still does it very well. ",2015
5,"No, no, no. This is a movie about Mark Walberg being really really fit and about bad jokes and bad CGI. Nothing more, nothing less. Five is more than generous for this movie. It sucks seeing Will Ferell also, making these lousy movies all the time. Get someone to write a decent script and some nice jokes, for God's sake! ",2016
10,"I saw Daddy's Home in a packed theater at an afternoon screening and I personally think this movie's very funny in a lot of places. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire movie, and the rest of the audience agrees with me. There were times where the people in the theater were laughing so loudly and heartily that the next lines of dialogue were nearly inaudible! Everyone loved it so much, they clapped their hands at the end of the film, so critics, know what a great comedy is. The characters Griff and the boss played by Thomas Haden Church were particularly hysterical. The movie also has a few heartwarming moments to add to a really funny script. The trailers and TV ads didn't show all of the belly laughs for a change!! Great soundtrack to add to that. Daddy's Home is a hilarious gem and it's definitely worth going to watch in the theater!!!! Don't believe the critics that gave this a negative review who just select little nitpicks and enlarge them to an extent so that they can get a paycheck- go watch this!!",2015
1,"This movie is one of the worst movie i every watched, This movie is about a loving foster father who work hard to provide for his family, he gave them love, food and shelter. Until one day the biological father (Fun Dad) came out of nowhere, he took everything from him, the children, the house and even his work. This show isn't really a comedy as i don't even find this movie with a pinch of funny. So glad i didn't pay to watch this show, this is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The foster dad,i had never seen anyone so clueless, what's worst the end, the biological got another super hot wife. Moral of the story, don't bother about your children, let someone take care of it, than come back and take everything back, god isn't going to punish you. Sorry i watched only 40 minutes of the movie and i forwarded to the end, the front is horrible the ending is terrible. Its like the movie is not even funny and they are trying to squeeze out the funny.",2016
6,"Given how much I loved ""The Other Guys"",I was pretty excited to see Ferrel and Wahlberg back together again. But it turns out that ""Daddy's Home"" is for the most part just a normal family friendly comedy. It lacks the edge and twisted humor you'll normally find in Will Ferrel movies.",2016
10,"""Daddy's Home"" was a very enjoyable movie to watch! The mix of polar opposites Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg was almost perfect. Ferrell plays the wimpy, goody two-shoes husband who is desperately trying to keep his wife and step-kids together as a family. Wahlberg plays the charismatic and tough guy ex-husband/biological father looking to win back his family at almost any cost. The beautiful Linda Cardellini plays Sara the wife/ex-wife who is caught in the hilarious tug of war between her two suitors. While the plot is somewhat predictable, the humor is fresh and so very enjoyable! If you're looking for an hour and a half of laughs, look no further and go see this enjoyable movie. However, you might want to leave the younger kids at home for this one because of sexual innuendo and language.",2015
10,"Fun and very funny movie. One of,if not the best comedy of the year based on the amount of laugh out loud moments. No filler, Very well paced and never a dull moment. Laughs were frequent and often throughout the entire running time. If you like the premise of the trailer and found it funny then the film totally delivers on it. The audience around me were laughing throughout too and it was a packed screening. I can't understand why the critics have given it such poor reviews, worse than the majority of the other comedies reviewed this year or before. Maybe they want you to go and see that boring below average Star Wars movie that's dominating film news and screens at multiplexes right now. If you want to be entertained, have fun and leave the cinema totally satisfied then i would thoroughly recommend Daddy's Home over the blandbuster Star Wars The Force Awakens anyday.",2015
8,"""Modern Family"" has been showing it to us on our TV screens since 2009. On the big screen, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" talked about it back in 1993: ""Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together. They don't fight all the time, and they can become better people, and much better mummies and daddies for you. There are all sorts of different families."" The Best Picture Oscar winner ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" dramatized it back in 1979, along with numerous other TV shows and movies before and since. These entertainment products reflect today's society and help people deal with the stresses and heartbreak of divorce and the formation of new and even unconventional families. Often, TV shows and movies do these things with humor, as in the film ""Daddy's Home"" (PG-13, 1:36).",2015

Some people still find Adam Sandler funny (and relevant)while others find the rebooted canned laughter of early eighties slapstick comedy the right fit for their sense of humour. It is all about taste and what one actually finds amusing. I find Will Ferrell amusing and when he teams up with Marky Mark Wahlberg, then what you have are a couple of ""goofs"" that can actually make people laugh. They are opposite in every way and because of this extreme difference, their personalities just seem to gel.",2015

All the so called funny scenes are in the trailer but they look better in the trailer that when they happen in the movie. The first 'funny' scene starts at 50 minutes into the film. Then you have to wait another 10 minutes for another so called joke. There are perhaps 4 jokes like this in the entire movie. The dialogue has no humor. We wait hoping the dialogue will get funny or the film pace is going to kick in gear, but nothing happens. Not a family film either because of the language. ",2015
9,"I don't usually laugh out loud in a movie theater but I had at least 4 or 5 big ones here. I think Will Ferrell can be great in the right spot, but certainly not all of his movies have been entertaining, same for Wahlberg. They play off each other very well in a very intelligent comedy, Will is the touchy feely warm step dad and Wahlberg the macho irresponsible bio dad. The movie plays out very smartly and, unlike a lot of other recent movies, doesn't run too long. The other characters are well played, including Will's wife, and the final wrap is excellent. I have nothing more to say but the website requires 10 lines. An unashamed 9 of 10.",2016

Mark Wahlberg adds up to the support and behaves same as he did in 'The Other Guys' , which also had Ferrell. The kids are irritating . Actress doesnot have much to do apart from looking beautiful , which she definitely is. Mark and Will have a good chemistry. Ending is not upto the mark. Will's Boss also has a laughable role (not pun-intended) in the movie. Character for the black Guy is funny. The scene at Basketball stadium had me in splits due to Ferrell's outburst. :) Overall: A one time watch which if you need few Ferrell Laughs.",2016
5,"Will Ferrell's latest is a 2015 release that's less amusing than his boldest endeavors (The Campaign comes to mind). Let's just call Daddy's Home Ferrell lite shall we. At 96 minutes, ""Home"" as a comedy is stupid funny without being hilarious. It's like a mild hack job from director Sean Anders. Sean's leads (Willy Boy and Mark Wahlberg) are perfectly cast with a few laughs seeping through. However, the screenplay by ""Home's"" three writers is just meh. A creepy Thomas Haden Church (he plays a radio station owner) giving insensible advice is not amusing. A gag involving a dog who looks ragged while possessing silver-colored eyes is also not amusing. A scene where characters dance with each other instead of fight each other is kind of half-baked. And finally, what's with the adage of locales used in Daddy's Home. Twenty minutes in and I thought things took place in Los Angeles, California. Come to find out that New Orleans, LA was the primary setting. I guess a car license plate and Pelicans basketball gave it away. Natch.",2016
8,"This is a story set in the early colonial period of New England. It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.",2016

8,"This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle. I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow, just like the whole movie.",2016
7,"To start, just so you know who's actually writing the review. Young fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The Conjuring.",2016
10,"If people from the 17th Century could make a film about their deepest darkest horrors - it would look a lot like this movie! The Witch engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates. Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie for horror fans and a masterful period piece. I would recommend it highly to horror fans and fans of history and good cinema in general.",2016
9,"Oh my freaking god, this movie. I've seen it twice now and I'm sure there will be more views in the future. It's just so perfect — a masterpiece, really — and the fact that it is director Robert Eggers' feature film debut makes it even more impressive. The mood, the choice of actors, the historical accuracy, the sort of discordant and frantic music, the tension, the character development, the slow build of a more psychological horror, the setting they just nailed every aspect. ",2017
10,"THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.",2016
9,"The best part about The Witch, besides the acting, is the dichotomy between drama and what is actually a surprisingly fast paced and accessible horror movie (with few genre clichés.) The film could be looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did; they murdered those roles.",2016
7,Production and costume designer Robert Eggers directs his first feature length debut about a family settling down in New England in the 1630s who experience something of the supernatural. ,2017
7,"When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. ",2016
1,"After reading the reviews here and hearing about the surprising success of this film, I was eager to watch it. I love plots involving history pieces as well as the possible paranormal. But as I started watching this movie, I found myself praying that there was just a slow build. Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for that up until the very end. The characters were annoying at best. The various elements and ideas introduced to move the plot along seemed to be only minimally explored. The two worst characters in my opinion, were the twins who, from the beginning, gave off an air that they could be evil. Yet when it is confirmed that they had been talking to the devil via a farm animal, the directors/writers still somehow maintained their characters as innocent children. The sporadic intense sequences seemed more tragic than spooky. And the ending was completely insane. A girl watches her whole family get murdered and is scared half to death then instantly decides that she wants to join a coven of naked floating women? Really? I was extremely disappointed in this film and even more in the misleading reviews on this site. I even double checked to make sure that I had watched the same film as those reviewing. So now I am just wondering if I can have those 2 hours of my life back...?",2016
1,"Yep, this studio suckered us into believing this was a slow-burn horror movie that would sit alongside Rosemary's Baby in the horror canon. I assure you, this movie won't even be discussed a year from now. This was a no-burn drama with pretty visuals, good acting, no story, and dialogue that was 60% unintelligible. Pure style over substance. I see a lot of reviews babbling on about religious/feminist symbolism blah blah blah. Problem is none of this matters without story and character. So much great indie horror that never gets a wide theatrical release (Starry Eyes, Babadook, V/H/S, Excision I could of course go on and on) and Hollywood gives us this. I am boycotting all future Robert Eggers movies as he was complicit in this scam. But what do he and the studio care? By the time bad word of mouth sinks this movie and it leaves the theaters after week 2, they will be depositing their 20mil in the bank. Spoiler Alert: As to the plot, it is as follows. A sexy witch in the woods scares this family in a cabin and they go mad and mostly kill each other (maybe because of Calvinism and misogyny and stuff). Then a bunch of witches float in the final scene. Shortly thereafter the movie ended, and someone yelled ""refund"". I went home mad.",2016
1,"What shall I saith to thee!! First I barely understood what they were saying. The beginning had some potential, was the daughter a witch? Did the twins do something? Then somewhere in between all this nonsense, the black goat was the evil entity, for a lack of a better word. I don't know if the producer, director or writer took too much acid before finishing the movie. There is really no words to describe what I just watched. All I know is if I could bleach out my eyes, and my brain I would. ",2016

Thinking back now I'm pretty sure there was a misrepresentation of dialogue in the trailer. No big deal,right? Wrong! I do not understand their English tongue. I had to focus all the will power I have in my body to catch enough of it to make a comprehensible sentence. Even with all that concentration I may have caught about 50% out what was said. Meanwhile, my friend in the movie theater must of thought I was really into it because he kept looking over and asking what was going on. With a title of Witch I kind of expected to see a movie with a witch in it. Wait for it..... there's a bunny, there's a goat, there's even a hot chick in a cabin in the woods, but sadly there no Witch.",2016

Some terrible acting (save for perhaps the lead character daughter who in spite of her performance cannot save this film). Ridiculous dialog. Saving graces were the soundtrack and atmosphere (wherein a creepy film should have been quite was to bring forward).

10,K.C. Undercover is an amazing show for family and kids it's filled with fun and action! And the even more awesome thing is this is Zendaya second Disney show. she even had too DCOM Frenimies and Zapped. ,2015
10,"K.C Undercover is an amazing Disney channel show! It is always refreshing to watch another episode, and the new episodes are always better than the last episode, which is entertaining because we can always look forward to the next episode and the show supplies a constant supply of new and episodes that are always funny and engaging. Because K.C is a spy, this allows the show to explore and interact with a variety of unique and different locations and situations, different from other shows, which makes the series far more entertaining and engaging. I believe that K.C Undercover is suitable for children and always makes me laugh. The show's characters all have a unique character, and they all blend well with each other and allow the show to explore these new locations and interact in the funniest way possible, and the jokes always make me laugh. If you haven't already watched the show, I think you need to go right now and watch it, because you are missing out on one of the best entertaining shows!",2016
10,"It reminds me of Kim Possible and That's So Raven with its spy-centered plot and constant costumes that the main character, KC Cooper, wears. It brings back old Disney in a nice way and the humor is refreshing as well. The characters are interesting and dynamic, and the sibling teasing is playful and amusing. Hopefully, it stays on air for longer than two years, unlike I Didn't Do It, which I still don't understand why it was cut off air. It was probably one of the better Disney shows at the time, anyway. And it would have been better if they had wrapped up the series in a nice, finale episode, but no, instead it was just cancelled out of nowhere. That kind of annoyed me for a while. Hopefully, that's not the case with this show, though. Overall, KC Undercover is a fun family show that brings back nostalgic memories of old Disney, so I would definitely recommend it.",2016
10,Omg! This is the best Disney Show Ever. It's way better than the old Disney show Kim Possible! We have way more action! It's way more entertaining. If you don't like K.C. Undercover then your lost! Because this is so amazing!!!!,2015
8,"Zendaya said that she would bring old Disney back referencing the Disney TV hits that came out during the late 90's to mid 2000's. Before watching her show I was very skeptical. I mean, with new Disney instead of wise parents giving advice- the parents are stupid and seem more whimsical then their children. Dog with a Blog for crying out loud is a show! However, I started to watch KC Undercover and at first I was grudgingly thinking okay...that was kinda funny. To chuckling to snorting to actual laughter to rewinding because it was so funny. Her parents are cool and actually quite funny and smart. KC is mathematician nerd who can't talk yet is quite proud of being a girl AND defeating villains. Plus, the show's fight scenes are AWESOME. I adore KC and Clarisa's relationship as well as adorkable Ernie. My only problem is that I would like Ernie to have more shining moments. Nerd little brother is a little cliché, real character development would be cool. That goes for Clarisa too. She's fun and bubbly but I would like her to have more brains than beauty. Though the rest of the characters I quite adore. Craig and Kira are hilarious! Judy is sass queen and KC is just QUEEN. I was doubtful but I am digging her show.",2015

10,"Talk about a show being better than it should have been! When I saw commercial after commercial of this show, I thought I was going to HATE it. But Disney proved me wrong, because this is a fantastic show for some one like Zendaya. If you don't know Zendaya, #1, shame on you, and #2, she's an actress that is not unfamiliar to the Disney Channel crowd. She was in Shake It Up!, Frenemies, and Zapped. She is also a really great dancer, so it's not a big leap from dancing to kicks and punches. Zendaya plays K.C., a regular straight A student that wouldn't seem out of place on a TGIF sitcom. But, like in Hannah Montana, she also lives a double life as a SPY! So the show is mostly a Spy Kids version of Hannah Montana, but much funnier than Spy Kids and less musical than Hannah Montana. The show also has some other funny characters like K.C.'s parents, Ernie, Marisa, and J.U.D.Y., who all have great lines and mostly don't move into the stereotypical characters we've seen in other Disney Channel shows. They also have great guest stars, such as Bella Thorne, who played Zendaya's friend in Shake It Up!, and Raven from That's So Raven, one of my favorite shows from the early 2000s! Now this review is becoming too positive.I'm gonna have to nitpick. The only nitpick I have is that Marisa isn't a good enough character. She just seems like a useless character that could've been scraped. But even though I think that way, I don't HATE Marisa. In fact, I think that this show might be one of my top 5 favorite shows! So, anyways, K.C. Undercover was better than I could've expected, and I WANT MORE EPISODES!",2015
10,I absolutely love watching K.C. Undercover! I've seen every episode and am super excited for season 3! I love how it combines extremely zany silliness with plots that keep you glued to the TV hanging on every moment to see what's going to happen next. It's fantastic! It's a kids show but I think older teens might find it enjoyable too as well as some adults like myself. It's a pretty well rounded show.,2017
3,"Look, I'll give the show this: It's one of the less cringy Modern-Disney sitcoms on the air, but still not very good. I'm in the target audience for these shows, and I can honestly say, I don't like it. At all. The acting is bad, the characters are weak, the writing? Beyond lazy, and the action sequences are just poorly handled. But my BIGGEST problem with this show, is that it has the EXACT same plot line as one of Disney's greatest shows, Kim Possible. The only difference between this show and Kim is that it's live action with less suspense. Oh, yeah, and Kim Possible is actually GOOD. Bottom Line: I don't recommend it for any age, and I know others would agree. But hey, it's better than Bizzardvark and has a catchy theme...so...points there!",2016
7,"This is something different.And even though it's not exactly the old Disney you know and love,its actually something you would actually enjoy.I'm a 20 something year old who still watches kids shows.I absolutely love this show,and even though the jokes aren't the best or aren't executed in a funny way all the time,its still exciting to watch and see where the story goes.I was immediately drawn to it when I just saw the name,and I've been watching ever since.So It's not exactly the good old Disney,but it's better than the other garbage shows,like Liv and Maddie,Best Friends Whenever,Bizaardvark to name a few.",2017
9,"This show is very refreshing and features interesting ideas and motives for the characters. Only some characters have very bad acting, such as marissa and ernie. Still, because ernie can pull of being funny, he is tolerable and not bad. The main actress could have been better, even though her personality is supposed to be serious and uninterested, she could still be interesting. Being dull the entire time or pretending like you're misunderstood makes you annoying to watch. Other than that, the martial arts are very fun to watch, very real and interesting plots that involve the parents as well, not as irritating intervening people but as actual characters with important roles and personalities who enhance the show. It's amazing that this show is featuring a strong female character, very likable. What shows like this have to focus on is not demoting their own 'female empowerment' by making repulsive, sexist statements, like 'man up', or some female complaining about 'getting muscles', etc. Doing those type of things just makes the entire idea of the female lead being a strong fighter lame and fake, something for just entertainment and not achievable in the real world. This is another problem with my babysitter's a vampire, in which the female vampires are so powerful, yet sexist bullshi* is everywhere in the show, made by both the female and male characters. Other than that, k.c. undercover is really interesting to watch because the plots and acting, for the most part, are great. the scenes are too rushed, however, because they have to fit so much in a single episode. It should seem a bit more natural instead of just dialogues being forced everywhere. sometimes dialogues should stop and just show character expressions and emotions, instead of filling space with words for no reason. 9/10",2017
7,"K.C. Undercover is a refreshing, detective-based sitcom that introduces very different characters with many personalities. It's pretty funny and has diabolical schemes that hold one's attention; however, it can also be a bit boring at times. K.C.'s acting is very well done and her fighting is excellent. She is very energetic and realistic when she fights and her determination is very sharp. But, because her character outside of her spying is distant from people, the show can get a bit boring to watch. She doesn't participate in anything more than her spy work, which creates a monotony. The seriousness of K.C. is balanced well by her friend, Marissa, who does a good job of looking foolish. Every character acts very well, and there is no over the top screaming or obnoxiousness.",2017

We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication.

10,"'The Big Short' is a winner. Based on Michael Lewis book of the same title, it tells the sorry story of the fraud and deceit practiced on the American people, nay, on the world by Wall Streets finance capitalism. We know the culprits: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros., Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Wachovia, Crdit Suisse, UBS and on and on who invented financial instruments such as CDO, credit swaps and other fancy unintelligible names, based on mortgages, with the connivance of the credit agencies--Dow Jone, Standard and Poors and Fitch. 'The Big Short' with a light seriousness is a crash course on the duplicity of Wall Street investment bankers who earned large fees on junk bonds with triple A ratings; who bundled junk to palm off on an unsuspecting public looking for big gains by pandering to the snake oil exilir of getting rich quickly; and who feed on the niavety of the broad American have-nots with the dream of owning a home of their own. And so with some humor but much sadness are we lead through the byways of four different groups of bankers who saw the hoax for what it was and its impending implosion that would bring down the deck of cards of capitalism. And the took out bets on the market, by buying short. And they won big time! But the banks are still around, and the ratepayers footed the bailout, but at what cost! And we see this in the turmoil of the Republican party: for the discontent abroad in the US has thrown more than 25 percent of the population into poverty, loss of jobs, home, into heavy debt and no future for their children. And these banks have not reformed their ways...now they've come up with the same of gimmicks with a fancy name--something like beneficial financial tranche--as the play the same old mug's game. And like the Bourbons, t The cast is stellar--especially Christian Bale and Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling as well as the minor players. And like the Bourbons, in the words of Talleyrand, 'they learned nothing and forgot nothing', but the contempt they have for all of us.

6,"One would think that in the absolute least it would be extremely difficult to make an intriguing movie about the housing market and the US banking system and the greedy people who invest and gamble with our country's future... while keeping a cyber-age audience entertained, but The Big Short not only manages to accomplish that goal but does it excellently. The major drawback to this film is that the pace is too fast for an average viewer to sort out who's who from a host of actors, each of whom portrays a key player in a complex intertwined financial system. That being said, this film targets the painful nerve of every American, a nerve that careens through their job security, affecting their monetary value and terminates in the core of their family's welfare: the place they cherish and call their home, for every man's home is his ""castle"" and whoever messes with a man's castle, is messing with the man's family. The repressed anger of the American people over the 2008 crises and the memories of the financial loss they have endured will be inflated as they watch this film and then ""pricked"" by the irritating, aggravating and infuriating outcome.

Though most of the time these nay-sayers will not profit from your misfortune, such is not the case in The Big Short, Adam McKay's (""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"") hard-hitting comedy/drama about the collapse of the housing market in 2008. Based on the book ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"" (2010) by Michael Lewis with a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph (""Love and Other Drugs""), the film centers on a group of Wall Street functionaries who, despite the industry, government, and media telling them otherwise, discover that the market for bonds based on subprime mortgages is on shaky grounds and is doomed to collapse.",2016
1,"Not really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust. The movie makes it out like these few people were the only ones who knew there was a problem brewing. Uh, no, zillions of people knew as early as 2004, including me, and I'm no Einstein. What set these guys apart is that they figured out a good way to profit from the coming collapse, although it was never made exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they made.",2016
9,"Adam McKay's ""The Big Short"" is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review.",2017
5,Okay. So why is 'The Big Short' an average film?,2016
9,"This film is tough to watch having lived through the housing crisis and unemployment meltdown of 2007 to present. It inspires righteous indignation and they are a lot of unlikable people that you encounter throughout the film. Don't get the wrong impression, this film is an absolute necessity on raw economics majors and even the fringe behavioral economists.",2016
1,Some good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like having actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain complex financial deals.,2016
1,"Absolutely same story of the protagonists (Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Steve Carrell). They could have rather avoided making each scene from all three guys' perspective. It is like same scene repeated twice. The movie which pretends to be informative, is full of errors. Christian bale in one scene says loan to value is 5. This makes no sense, he probably meant loan to equity. The Jenga tower was made wrong. It was showing AAA to be most risky. Most of the speeches were cynical with little meat. The key climatic speech by Steve had no logic and only rhetoric like ""I have no issues in telling you that you are wrong"". But do you also have any reasons why the said person is wrong. Avoid, if you possible. Much more interesting documentaries are available on the housing crisis.",2016
9,"As a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected personally) - this is a well told story. The acting is great - the inserts of a chef explaining things, and a pop star - very interesting tactic. The individual characters are all well acted and developed. Many people do not get that the banks play games with the average person - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different words for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money - not help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a place to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of the questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off and passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic money maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is right the mortgage holder owns the home. This is a movie that more people should see - the acting is great - the story is told well and all need to watch what happens in the future.",2016
9,"While not as funny, binge worthy, or all together accessible as her first sitcom, 30 Rock, Tina Fey's second outing as head writer proves to have its own charms. The series may be slow at first, but give it three to four episodes and you'll be hooked. With a cast that gets better with age, writing that goes from zany and out of this world to surprisingly profound and sweet, and a stellar sense of humor, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is the kind of series that improves over time, much like Ms. Fey's first sitcom. The cast includes a zesty Carol Kane, the funny as always Jane Krakowski, 30 Rock Guest alum Tituss Burgess, and our lead Ellie Kemper; these four hilariously colorful players take the normal NBC formula for comedy and make it into something far smarter and much sharper. The writing also manages to succeed beyond my expectations. As a HUGE fan of 30 Rock, I know Ms. Fey can write up a storm. However, I thought it was the comedian perception of Television that made it so fresh. No it's her perception of diversity and identity and all their wonderfulness that makes this show work so well. As I mentioned earlier, the show is funny yes, but also much deeper than the common person will perceive. I'm glad to know that Netflix went for the full two seasons, for this show demands at least that many to get into its full rhythm. Remember, 30 Rock wasn't a masterpiece till season 3 I can't wait to see where the shows is when it hits its third season and trust me there will be a 3rd season.",2015
9,"What a brilliant, brilliant show. I'm surprised that I'm the first reviewer on here! Seriously though, I began streaming this show just about an hour ago, with netflix's system of 'single-day-season-releases' I've just kept streaming. I'm now up to the third episode and I'm blown away with how funny this show is. Tina fey has always been hilarious to me, and same with Ellie Kemper, so i've been intrigued by this show since it's announcement. This show is, at it's roots, a very funny show, chances are you will laugh a lot during this show. But it's not all about that, this show has several layers, it's got lots of heart and fantastic characters. As I mentioned before, I'm only up to the 3rd episode but this show is showing fantastic promise, I haven't been this invested in a show's pilot in a while. Hilarious story, fantastic acting, great writing, great direction. This looks like a good one, stream it when you get the chance! 9/10 (so far)",2015
4,"I was a loyal fan of Tina Fey's 30 Rock, which was the reason that drew me to watch this show. I watched a few episodes, and was profoundly disappointed. Compared to the sharp wit and even emotional attachment Tina Fey was able to build in 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt feels like a stale pizza from a fast food restaurant.",2015
10,"Newest show from Netflix is a hit. A very enjoyable light series that keeps the comedy rolling while exploring a much deeper drama. This is your new ""go to"" show when you just need a reason to smile. As for smiles, Ellie Kemper's is as genuine and heartwarming as they come.",2015
1,"This is a waste of time. From the beginning sequence of the ""token black man"" talk about how it's a miracle to a reporter, to the actual content of the show, I was dumbstruck by just how moronic this is. I am even more flabbergasted by the 8/10 scoring. It's outrageous in the worst of ways. With a token gay best friend, illegal Chinese immigrants, dumb-ass people from the Midwest; there is a stereotype for everyone! The humour is lackluster and stupid. It seems to cater to people who either are die hard Tina Fey and would follow her like she's a cult leader (some irony there), they're a masochist, or somehow hope it will get better. It doesn't, I promise.",2015
9,"This show is so fun! You can tell it's written by Tina Fey because it's got a (perkier) 30 Rock vibe. UKS utilizes many aspects of New York (Today show, times square, pick pockets).",2015
8,Firstly a heads up: I like Tina Fey. I like her way of seeing the world and her ability to make fun of very subtle things in a very blunt way. And I love 30 Rock. If you do too you'll appreciate Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. If you don't you'll fall in love with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and watch all 7 seasons of 30 Rock in one sitting.,2015
10,"It started slow. I honestly only watched it because it was advertised on Netflix and I thought it was an interesting plot. The pilot had me cracking a smile but it wasn't great. But because I was lazy, I let the next episodes play. I have to say I was glad that I did!",2015
5,"I really wanted to like this show, but the writing is all over the map and the situations are goofy and simple-minded. I was expecting something as good as The Office but unfortunately it's on the same level as Scrubs. If they slowed down and took the time to build the characters and the situations, they might create a relatable scenario, but the bi-polar 1930s-style slapstick, jarring transitions, and cookie-cutter character archetypes come together to form an unsatisfying whole; it's like eating a Twinkie for dinner. There's a laugh here and there, but it comes off as accidental rather than intentional. Well, I watched three episodes and I'll stop there.",2015
10,"There's a lot to what seems to be a simple story of an Indiana Mole Woman moving to New York to finally experience life how she wants it. Tina Fey and her writing team already proved themselves with 30 Rock which had some of the best written comedy of all time with what is in my opinion one of the best television characters of all time, Jack Donaghy, and while Kimmy Schmidt is a different approach to her formula it still very much feels like something from the minds of the creators of 30 Rock. The Jokes are still fantastic and smart, with Pop Culture references to an extreme and quirky humor that goes along very well to the silly tone of the show itself.",2015
2,I want to start by saying that I have only watched about half of the first season.,2017
5,"First of all - I am big fan of 30 rock but this just seemed a bit lost. To be completely honest, I felt that 30 rock kept losing its wit towards the end and I didn't complete watching the whole series. But Tina took some time off and then this show came along, with very promising plot and all... But for me the writing is a bit stiff and many times very ""sitcomy"" and I don't find the jokes and the characters original, to be honest. I have really tried. I have watched it all but it just didn't click with me and I really do believe that it is mediocre at best. There are far more funnier shows to watch, trust me...",2015
1,"This show takes a very serious thing such as kidnapping and turns it into a ""comedy"". It is filled with cliché characters and a predictable and boring plot. Not to mention the irrationally annoying intro that is trying to be a meme so hard. From the minute I saw what the show was about I imagine what some who was abducted for a long period would think of it and I don't think that they would find it very funny. Along with all of the characters being so unfunny and blatantly unoriginal, this show is not worth watching. I honestly do not understand all of the amazing reviews given to this show. Especially with the *spoilers* the outrageous part in the show when the abductor is on trial. The whole court system is made to look fake and to make him look good for ""comedic sake "" but in actuality it just proves all of the statements listed above.",2016
1,"I'm 4 episodes in and I decided I can't waste half-hour increments of my life anymore. I feel like I am waiting for a payoff that will never come. 4 episodes is way too far into a series to still feel as if it isn't going anywhere at all. For all the other reviews that are saying ""just wait it out"" HOW LONG AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT?! In the total of 2 hours that I've watched this show I've probably chuckled very slightly about 3 times. Another review said it correctly, any laugh you get feels accidental. The events are nonsensical. The whole show is nonsensical. There are monumental plot holes right from the start that literally have no real-life logic whatsoever. I expected so much because this is by Tina Fey and because of internet hype and I got nothing. It's so bad that this is my first ever IMDb review. I specifically made an account because I was so appalled by the reviews and high ratings already posted. I can't even believe a network threw money at this TV show. Don't waste your time.",2015
3,"Only because so many critics and boards gave high marks to this show did I watch it. What a waste of time, it's no surprise NBC choose not to air it, it is very doubtful it would have made it past a few episodes.",2015
1,"OK, so at the time of writing this post this show is/was at 8.2 out of 10. I am now convinced between this shows 8.2 rating and many other flops out there being rated up on IMDb and RT, that there is no other explanation then anonymous and personally financially motivated trolled uprated/overrated reviews. Reading a good review of this show is like hearing someone trying to tell you that blue is actually red. When in fact blue is blue and red is red... as we should all know. With this type of abuse that im sure is well over shadowing legitimate reviews, I cant help feel lost in finding a site I can now trust. For this particular show, NETFLIX should just remove it and any residual trace of it from their servers and leave it in the deep bowels of the darknet to be illegally downloaded ironically... leaving this disgrace of a show behind and below them.",2015
4,Like one reviewer already noticed - this show uses every stereotype imaginable. Using an Asian guy's name as a verbal pun (a sophomoric one at that) is something I'd expect to see in a sitcom from the sixties and seventies.,2015
1,"AND YET I NEED 10 lines to explain why. Oh boy. Okay. So one, the lack of depth ... with each and every character. Although, I still enjoyed seeing Jane K muscle it out with her debonaire cheese and arrogance; I can stomach it because she's still Jane K. But back to the rest of how this series was awful: The writing. Overly contrived and flippant over the tragedy of being kidnapped while trying to be corny and funny. Oh the corny was there, but that was it. The main character: Kemper plays KS as way too hyperactive and way way to perky that it's just not funny or credible. And then there's the rest of the cast including Titus and T Fey who did their bestest to be very funny, but instead ended up being cheesy, sophomoric and stupid without the funny. Don't get me wrong; I love funny stupid stuff in comedy ... but this didn't cut it even if I was waaay more stupid at a time when I was like 23 or so. But then, honestly, I don't like T Fey anyway, never have ... yet I'm pretty sure I can keep an open mind if there is at least something funny and inspiring ... I can even savor it. Anyway, the other characters were just as vapid and corny (haha haha??? no) again without the funny which got on my daggon nerves even more. I actually think Jon Hamm delivered more for an actor who is STILL trying to be funny and who usually isn't. Unfortunately there isn't much of J Hamm to enjoy and most of his stints aren't that funny but again funnier than anyone else. And that, my friends is pretty much it. And that is all. Dig in or don't bother. Even if a bunch of marketeers for the production pretend to be a bunch of consumers pretending to lOVE THIS SHOW, try not to be fooled by the hype. But if you must check it out and you think I'm just a disgruntled baffoon, try Netflix for one month for FREE and if and when you hate it, don't blame me, just turn it off and then UNSUBSCRIBE TO NETFLIX AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Because they will charge your butt within a month. You've been warned.",2015
3,"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is certainly among the top shows in the annoying genre. It will make you regret the invention of moving pictures in just one episode. It does this through characters that are detestable, despite their wholesome appearances, and stories that are forgettable and clichéd. Elle Kemper absolutely nails the over-hyped, fish-out-of-water role that will make you grimace more than dragging nails on a chalkboard with your teeth. Kemper's facial expressions defy the very rules to which the human body was designed to conform. Her roommate ticks all the boxes in the diversity field and almost manages to upstage her in annoyance. Both break into song at unpredictable times so you never know when you body will lurch into a spasm. Its premise is both illogical and irrelevant, only used when convenient to something resembling a plot. Perhaps the series would work better with a few jokes. Until then, the show should be placed in a fallout shelter and sealed from the world.",2015
7,"I'm a little late to the party as I've only watched Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt this year, but I figured it was time to watch it since I'm a fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock. I like all of the characters, with my favorite being Titus since he has some of the most memorable and hilarious lines of the show. I quickly binge watched seasons 1 and 2 in the matter of days, but it took me a few weeks to get through season 3. I wanted to like it and I was very excited to watch it, but it was honestly a big let down compared to the previous two seasons. The jokes felt forced and I was very unhappy with some of the plot decisions. It felt like major story lines were built up only to be torn apart and it was disappointing to see that happen after spending so much time invested in them. The season 3 finale was a little better and I was relatively happy with how they set up the plot for season 4, but I'm worried they'll just repeat the same mistakes as this time around. Overall, this show is an amusing, feel good comedy and it does bring a smile to my face, I just hope that the writers will have some more focus and direction in the coming seasons.",2017
5,"I never watched 30 Rock but it is clear there are similarities. Lead Role starring the Secretary of The Office. Towards the end there are some helping guest appearances from John Hamm, Hank from BB and Nick Kroll. The regular characters aren't sympathetic to me, which is an important aspect about a series.  The black gay guy couldn't be more generic. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is overall too loud and too over the top but every episode has a handful scenes of comedy gold in it.  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is never going to be a good comedy series but a watchable TV show. This is a typical filler comedy, something I watch while I'm eating or doing other things.",2015
1,"The show revolves around Kimmy - a woman who was rescued from an underground bunker where she spent 15 years as part of a doomsday cult, all the while unbeknownst the apocalypse was fake. She moves to New York City to get a fresh start on life. The show revolves around Kimmy, Titus - her apartment mate, Lillian - their landlord, and Jacqueline - Kimmy's first employer.",2017
10,"Having now watched the complete series in an utterly unstoppable binge I can say without a shadow of a doubt that, for me, this is up there with the greats like True Detective, Breaking Bad and Rectify (to name but a few). Never so much has a show swayed my feelings towards the characters; I had several about faces with regards to my sympathies but it left me feeling that nothing is ever black or white. This is not for those who want a fast pace and constant excitement. The characters are developed slowly and cleverly as is the storyline which keeps you guessing. The cinematography is phenomenal and I bet you will all be wanting to move to The Keys after watching this I do hope they make a follow up series, however if they want to leave us wanting more but very satisfied at the same time stopping here would do just that. The cast, without exception were stellar in their performances.",2015
9,"Bloodline is a quality Netflix series, that totally validates their strategy of delivering a season in complete, binge-worthy form, rather than an episode at a time. I watched it over two days. It's hard to imagine a movie with a better cast; the performances from top to bottom were sensational. I also appreciated the salty, adult, realistic language of the characters. One of the earlier reviewers spoke of all the characters as being ""terrible people."" Couldn't disagree more; virtually all the the characters from Kyle Chandler to Sissy Spacek to Cloe Sevigny are likable, compelling individuals who find themselves in a difficult situations. It's about good people making fateful decisions. Bloodline is a beautifully produced, deeply human drama, that, once it gathers speed, will grab ahold of you. Kudos, Netflix.",2015
1,What a disappointment! Two great seasons then......this? There were too many dead ends to count: what happened to the Sheriff race? Nolan watches John and Kevin stash the drugs at Danny's place but never mentions it. The great mystery between Roy and Sally that is teased on episode after episode is blurted out by John in last episode with no indication of how he found out. Not that it mattered. Biggest mystery: where on earth was Netflix quality control? Don't they ask for a story line before approving a season?,2017
10,A wonderful tale and a spellbinding story. Great slow pace that was perfect for the setting of the Keys. I loved every episode. Masterful writing and top notch acting. Very good cast with several new actors that did a phenomenal job. Cant wait for season 2! ,2015
1,"Bloodline started off great. Season one and two were excellent. But it just fell apart on season 3. The first episode was horrible making no sense at all. The show semi recovered throughout season 3 but the last 2 episodes were a joke. You can hardly understand any of Sissy's lines. She is either whispering or sobbing. The last 2 episodes are so fragmented they make practically no sense and the ending is little more than a joke. Very much like Dexter, great show then it just falls apart. It almost seems the same writers are involved. Good story but incapable of coming up with an ending. I was so disappointed with the last 2 episodes I felt like it was just a total waste of time. Really a shame for a show that had so much potential.",2017
10,"Watched all episodes in 4 days, found it to be compelling and interest escalated with each episode. Which is what I believe a series should do. After each episode we had questions which spawned much conversation, then on to the next episode. Questions answered , more questions created. It became fun and compelling at the same time. Characters developed and relationships became important. Typical family hierarchy and troubles . Flash forwards were awkward at first but then it all started to fall in place. Last episode provided a lot of answers but also created more questions and tantalizing interest for more. Some critics panned it as being slow, some as being cliché or predictable, maybe so, but it was excellent and left most with wanting more. Looking forward to a possible season 2. All in All worth watching completely and form your own opinion! Also Love opening theme song.",2015
7,"I loved the first 2 seasons of Bloodline. Great story and acting. But WOW!!! season 3 was terrible. I assume the writers did not know what to do to conclude this show. My wife and were so eager for this release but man what a let down. This is my first time to submit a review to IMDb as I tend to just read other reviews. However, I felt compelled to express this opinion. If you have not watched Bloodline yet, my advice is to watch and enjoy seasons 1 & 2 but stay away from this 3rd season.",2017
10,"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet.. After binge watching House of Cards - I was searching the streets... literally billboards and MTA Bus Stop Posters.. for my next Binge IV Drip ""fix"" and I saw Bloodline.. the tag line intrigued me because in real life, Good People sometimes do Bad Things.. so I tapped a vein and went for it... and this is where I stop to say.. Trust me!!! Bloodline is extremely top of the line true Blue.. 99.999% pure; you know.. like the stuff Walter White used to make before his season was over.. I couldn't stop watching.. I did all 13 in 24. I highly recommend it and I am looking forward to Season Two because the Cliff Hanger almost sent me to the ER... but my insurance is for poo and my co-pay is too high.. so I'm currently going cold turkey off the 13's. Gonna take up hiking and juicing for a spell. xo",2015
8,"This seemed in its first two seasons to be a most promising show. Leading with Sam Shepard and Sissy Spacek as Robert and Sally Rayburn, it has a great cast, Ben Mendelsohn, Kyle Chandler, and Norbert Leo Butz particularly stand out, but there are no weak acting performances. The setting is the Florida Keys, and the story line taps into Southern Gothic elements and into the prime time soaps of the 80s such as Dallas and Flamingo Road to draw inspiration. Lots of long-buried but not forgotten family secrets and lies swirl around, creating intrigue, mystery, things that happened long ago, but still loom large.",2017
5,"We loved this series until it got to the last two episodes! Yes, a couple of scenes with flashbacks is OK but a whole episode! It got tediously boring and it was so obvious that Mendelson was wearing a really nasty wig. Did they run out of money? A great series with a really poor ending! Pity!",2017
10,"Wonderful, amazing plots and people--Kyle Chandler is total eye candy:)Netflix is doing a wonderful job in the original series department...Just say no to cable TV:) Netflix Keep up the great work....I loved this series--because its real~real people, real family problems,no veneers, fake boobs, lips or face jobs or other distractions to take away from the great story line...very refreshing~ I hope that you bring more indie type series as well, cannot stomach sitcoms or the totally fake reality TV- thank you for carrying the new artists and new talent in the production services as well-It is going to be a great summer:)",2015
3,"I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I've SEEN IN YEARS !!Season 1 and 2 are excellent ...Season 3 is an absolute mess , not one bit interesting exciting ,it seems it was made by a totally different production company its just horrible ..every episode is slow meaningless drawn out , its simply lazy writing to wrap up a once good story ! Kyle chandler is the only good thing in the show he is a great actor . but man season 3 is miss able even if a fan of 1 and 2 .",2017
6,"The acting and production are solid. The location and sets are superb. However the storytelling and pace are maddeningly slow. In all honesty, I am probably not the ""TV Series"" type. I just don't have the patience for long drawn out dramas. In this case, the character developments could have been fully accomplished in 'half the time', leaving the other half for something interesting to actually happen. I get it: ""black sheep addict/dysfunctional family/dark secret"". Do we really need 50 minutes of tedium to compose this hackneyed image??? The production is actually quite skillful at building suspense. And again the piece is 'professional and polished'. However in each case of heightened suspense the piece falls flat. It just doesn't deliver 'grist for the mill'. I will concede there is an audience for this one given the many positive reviews. C++",2015
1,You going to get hooked with season one and two but you are going to be completely disappointed with the third season. Is so bad that you gonna wish never have started watching it. May be producers wanted to end it so bad that they did not care about the script anymore. You gonna feel you wasted so many hours of your life for nothing when you get to season 3 .,2017
9,Just watched this on Netflix and wasn't expecting much. It was fantastic and I highly recommend it. The Aussie actor Ben Mendelsohn needs more recognition and plays the Danny character brilliantly. The other actors are great but he is exceptional. He sucks you right in and you truly don't know whether to feel sorry for him or think of him as the bad guy. This is really well written and keep you wanting more after each episode. Right up to the last 2 minutes. I binged watched this and was hooked line and sinker. ,2015
3,"The first season of Bloodline was entertaining and suspenseful. The Rayburn family have a secret, they seem like royalty with a skeleton in the closet. Danny (Ben Mendelsohn) comes home and you immediately sense there is some serious trouble coming.",2017
5,"After finishing this series, I walk away feeling angry and duped. I gave this show a chance because of its cast and the beautiful setting. But another series done by Kessler, Kessler and Zelman I will not endure and I recommend you do the same. As with Damages, they start off with a twist and so much hype, but with both shows they invariably box themselves into a corner. Why? Why do this? These three men have some great ideas but their plot lines are paper thin. (What was the reasoning behind the penultimate episode by the way? If you were going for a dreamy scene a la Sopranos...you failed.) Furthermore (again, like Damages) this show's main protagonists are so flat. There is no character development happening. You keep waiting, hoping you'll connect with the characters but it never happens. So, if you want to watch a show with characters you could care less about and a plot that goes nowhere, then watch Bloodline. I think Sally Rayburn's (Sissy Spacek) revelation at the end about her inn was a perfect summation of the show itself: should have never been created, and in ten years it'll be under water, worthless and forgotten.",2017

10,"If you ask your friends what they think of Bloodline, they won't be able to answer because they've probably never heard of it. However, Bloodline is easily on par with Breaking Bad and The Wire. ",2016
1,"This is quite possibly the most boring show I've ever watched. I really tried to give it a shot and watched 8 episodes of it. I had to force myself through this. Literally not one interesting thing happens in the span of 8 episodes. We have the inclination that Danny is a bad guy, but we don't know why. The family is a family of extremely ordinary superficial white people that are totally impossible to relate to or care about unless you are the same type of rich white person who lives in a beach house and owns a yacht. ",2015
5,Bloodline has a great cast and had a great first season. The wife and I burned through that first season in a weekend. You cared about the characters and you so wanted to know what had happened in the past.,2017
1,Thanks to another reviewer I saved 2 hours of my life and skipped the last two episodes.,2017
7,"This rating is based on 10 for the first two seasons and a 2 for the last season. I don't think there has ever been a more captivating story that fizzled into meaningless garbage in the end. The last two episodes can only leave me to believe that the writers either quit before then, or they decided that since the show was being canceled that they would deliver crap to fill out the rest of the season. What a disappoint.",2017
8,"The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",2015
8,The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships. ,2015
9,"There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.",2015
9,"""The Lobster"" takes the tropes and expectations of modern-day relationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical ""Hotel"" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1 characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, often resulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order to garner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coin is the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where even flirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanical delivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity of the situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not since Richard Ayoade's ""The Double"" has cripplingly awkward humour been so effective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature of relationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. The cinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes to the emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the characters inhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense for such an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, rough string melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-film which pervades ""The Lobster"": definitely a film which requires full attention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, ""The Lobster"" is a remarkable oddity.",2015
1,"As credits were running and Lobster viewers were exiting the theater, an attendant was standing by the door. He asked the exiting audience how the movie was.

Filippou on the other hand, strongly disagreed with his friend.",2016
1,"This movie was in my opinion pure and simple pointless. Why make it? There is no point. It only makes you feel seek and confused on why in a near future everyone should be a couple. Even the main idea has no sense. Some say dark comedy. Comedy? No way, just a deeply disturbing on all levels and violent senseless movie. And sorry but Collin Farrell is not an actor that should be use in a movie where the character is trying to show any kind of emotion but only in movies where he can play the pretty boy. Here he walks with the same expression on his face no matter what happens in the scene. No real emotion from his stone face. The end of the movie was unnecessarily disturbing like the rest.He was not believable as the man who can make such a sacrifice for the women he's in love with. I couldn't feel any kind of love between the main characters. Sorry, but I deeply disliked this movie.",2016
1,"I am one of the minority here who disliked the movie. Saw it yesterday and I am still horrified whenever I remember it. Yes, the performances were great and it was refreshing to see well known stars playing characters that are against their usual type. But I don't understand why the cruelty was necessary and what message could bring the audience the violence against animals. Although this film is presented as romantic, I didn't find any emotions apart from indifference and hatred in the characters, or actually in the whole world and story. All in all it's boring, too long, one does not understand why the people in the story act the way they do or how does the world where coupling is obligatory work. It's one of the movies I won't never EVER want to see again.",2016

Instead, we were treated to an overlong, pretentious art project that felt more like an undergraduate student film created by an emotionally stunted sophomore. All the actor's lines are delivered deadpan, with no emotion, regardless of the situation. There is are a few (very minor) chuckles to be sure, but they hardly compensate for the overall deadly serious tone. It's dreary, poorly edited, and contains some revolting scenes involving violent death and extreme animal cruelty. Truly terrible and a waste of a great cast.",2016
1,"No consistent theme to follow = no story at all. Btw this is my first review and the only reason I'm doing this is because the move was seriously that bad! Is it motivated by animal rights activism? Do they become animals as a way of making us humans more caring for other non-humans? (i.e. place a 'personal' or 'species' bias into the mix to create empathy) ... No ... Well, maybe for a minute ... Is it motivated by psychopathy ... well, maybe for a few more minutes ... does make you wonder whether the writer has some serious relationship issues! ... Smiles are extremely rare ... All characters have serious issues resulting from relationship problems it would seem - i.e. none are emotionally open in relating to one another (only emotions that characters express in the whole movie are negative: jealousy, anger, insecurity ... Nothing adds up - which is not an insecure need of the modern age as opposed to the post-modern one ... but a purely healthy way to make any sense of experience at all!!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing about this movie made sense for more than a short while ... Totally unpredictable, i.e. it has NO STORY to FOLLOW but is a random scene of stuff that never adds up and leaves you wondering whether the maker seriously thinks they can actually justify its existence on the basis of some lame postmodern perspective that warrants anything and everything as equally cool!!! TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!!",2015
1,"A kitchen sink of arbitrary ideas. The director is just throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. The story is based on a feeble and unconvincing premise. Anyone who fails to stay in committed relationships is turned into an animal. What?? When did the society care so much for everyone to be with a partner? The motivations of individual characters are just as uncompelling as the obstacles they are ""forced"" to overcome. Depictions of cruelty come from a desperate desire to move the story that is dead in the water and does not self-propel. I watched quite a bit of self-centered, pseudo-profound European movies in my youth; I never thought something like that would fly here. Miraculously it does. If this is a trend, we are in for some ugly, sad cinematic dystopia.",2016

There are and there were great directors in Greece(Nikos Panagiotopoulos, Vasilis Vafeas and, most of all, Stavros Tornes, to name a few) but Lanthimos is not one of them ;he is a fake and I was angry I had to watch this trash of a movie.

6,"The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental, or hotels in movies are places to be avoided).

1,"The high praise for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and also on IMDb made me make an account here. I have never disagreed more and quite frankly do not understand at all why the critics do not see how pretentious and awful this movie is. The actors are OK, but the film is a disaster. It starts out looking very art-house, with very slow story line and everybody looking artsy, but as it goes along the story becomes so utterly ridiculous and sickening without any purpose other than to be ridiculous and sickening that the movie really just turns into an empty shell, a pretentious 'how weird and shocking can we be' sort of thing. It wants to be art-house so bad it screams it at you. Overkill. The entire movie I wondered who had managed to convince the actors this was a good job to take on. Maybe I am looking at this from a European perspective? Maybe American cinema is lost in between Hollywood and a place they don't know where it is anymore. Art for art's sake can be good, but you can really fail if you overdo it. Maybe we can invent a new term for it: desperate cinema. Desperate to be special.",2016
2,"The Lobster is a load of pretentious BS, to put it simply. It's core message is an incredibly simple one, and one that the director seems to think is much more profound than it actually is. As an allegory, it's incredibly confusing - both sides are clearly meant to be villainous, but in terms of what they represent, it's black-and-white - being in a relationship or not. The audience becomes so confused that they just stop listening to what it represents, and As a story, it just doesn't work. Nobody has even a slight reason for doing anything. Society's reason for the relationship thing is never explained. The lady kills the dog for no reason. The singles are pointlessly mean and petty, and the protagonist is stupid for even trying to be with them. It's a flimsy narrative that falls apart under the slightest observation.",2016

I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece.

Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW...",2015

These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet.

""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions.

In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet.

6,"""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out.",2016
7,"I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season.",2016

That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that.

The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the ""Spotlight"" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time.

7,"This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.",2015

It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this.",2016

For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise.

The training scene was boring the build up was bad the plot was un realistic. not to mention they tarnished the legacy of a great movie character in apollo creed by having an affair with his wife, although it is necessary for the plot of the movie I don't agree with putting the great apollo creed in that light, especially since the rest of the movie everyone talks about him as this amazing man, how are non die hard rocky fans supposed to buy that? a few other issues, why did they turn Mickey's gym into the ""bad guy"" gym? shouldn't he have started in a new retro gym and came to rocky to train and he took him to Mickey's gym? That would have given all rocky fans a goose bump moment instead they were left with nothing. the only real shocker about this movie and (spoiler alert) is giving rocky cancer, that was probably the most intriguing part of the whole story. Also the build up of the leading couple was bad, i felt no connection to the two outside of the girl having that hearing problem there was nothing interesting about them. Finally the training scene was so stupid having all those guys do wheele's around him as he ran was so weird and ruined the entire scene. The fighting scenes were much more realistic and well choreographed compared to all the other rocky's which was this movies only really well done part, the ending of the fight is to a rocky fan, too predictable, it was great in rocky 1 and it was a fitting end to rocky 6, but makes no sense here and ended with the viewers questioning what next? instead of riding off into the sunset. the acting was solid by everyone involved but the writing was too corny to over come for the most part. a C-level movie at best",2015
8,"Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson. It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.",2016
9,"Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so he gets some new blood with a familiar name.",2015
9,"Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. ",2016
10,"First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B. Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Again, highly recommended.",2015
8,As a boxing movie Creed packs a heavyweight punch.,2016
5,"The 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be considered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe the hype cause it's merely disappointing. The movie on the surface tries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground stereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky has retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs of Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last name, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay includes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with an absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character suffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe for him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a supporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is trolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in IMDb, 94% in rotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely predictable and completely lacks emotion.",2016
2,"This HAS to be the year of nostalgia with the Original Star Wars trilogy remake, the Return to Jurassic Park Reboot and the memory of 1960's Bond in Spectre. But, the one I never asked for, nor anyone really needed, was to see Rocky XXXVIII.",2015
6,"CREED is a spin-off from the ROCKY franchise, bringing in fresh blood and taking it in a new direction. It feels a little like a remake of the first ROCKY movie, with Sylvester Stallone now playing the role of the aged trainer who helps a newcomer in the form of Michael B. Jordan to train for a title fight against a Liverpudlian boxer (!). The twist is that Jordan's playing Adonis Johnson, the son of the much-missed Apollo Creed who met his maker in ROCKY III.",2017
3,what a shame this could have been such a good film not bad acting by Stallone but its the story line that lets this film down how it has got a 8/10 is beyond belief only has 4 fights and is the world champion no big build up the one guy who knocks him out does not reappear to fight him so no revenge the make up on the eye of the last fight was terrible the original make up was bad but i thought 2016 but no not even a little bit believable its was not bad acting that spoiled the film just a bad story line the fact that Stallone has cancer should have been a bigger storyline in ie just living long enough to see him win or his deaf girlfriend signing him to get up after being knocked down but none of this they could have had the ghost of apollo shadow boxing with him in the ring anything but this such a waste of a film that could have been so much better,2016
4,"First of all, I like to start out that the acting was pretty good, especially Sylvester Stallone, who is of course: ""Rocky"". The big problem with this movie is that it was written and directed by some one other than Sylvester Stallone. In all the Rocky movies Stallone was the writer, and besides the first Rocky and The fifth Rocky, Stallone was also the director. What my point is, is that this random dude, that both Wrote and directed this movie, made the movie ""Creed"", with his own style and junk that has never been in any of the 'Rocky"" movies, and the story was very poorly written, as well as the whole flow to it. I really hated the sensuality in it, as well as the reasons why Adonis Creed became a full time boxer. The movie ""Rocky"" had so much more innocents and class and just the story all in all , just made so much more sense. Most importantly I felt no ""Motivation"" to ""Creed"" as a pose to ""Rocky"", because the story of ""Rocky"" just felt so real and innocent and full of purpose, which is complete opposite in the movie ""Creed"". In the movie ""Rocky"" you felt the motivation. Overall, to basically summarize everything, this movie had no class nor respect, for the previews movies, and the writing was so lame and so empty. Pretty much ""Creed"" was made for only one purpose... Money, cause the most of the stuff in this movie was a complete fail. The Creator of this movie knew that people would come to watch it,because of how great the ""Rocky"" series were, but like i said before, this movie was a complete bust, with only one intention, to put Rocky's name in this terrible film just to make money.",2015
2,"Why is this movie getting such good reviews? There is nothing here. The plot is just like all the rest of the Rocky movies, they even bring back the poor chickens. Lots of jump rope too. Oh, sorry not exactly like the other Rocky movies, nobody died in this one, but he did visit the cemetery. ",2015
9,"Just like it's counterpart, even this 7th installment to the franchise has proved the fact that the true story of the universe has just begun. Creed just like the original movie of the series has a strict focus on the characters, their struggles and eventual triumph, with only a role switch with the son of ""The Apollo Creed "" . This is one of the only few movies I loved watching this year, and I am pretty much thankful I did. In this review I shall justify the reason as to why this movie has received a rating as high as a 9/10.",2015
1,Crud may refer to:,2016
1,"Movie sucked!!! Makes me appreciate old school fight movies instead of this crap! Michael b.Jordan acting was mediocre at best. Sylvester Stallone could of gone a better angle bringing his son to follow the legacy,script was poor, and the scenes were poor, Story line was beyond cheesy, and predictable To me this movie tarnished the rocky legacy along with rocky 6, Stallone retired already, or at least try something different perhaps love story, I'm kidding, last few movies with Stallone have been a let down, Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this movie, director seemed very amateur Pop corn and movie rates this 5/10 People need to know how to give better reviews because the 8 they gave this movie is ridiculous.",2015
9,"There are movies like ""Rush"" or maybe ""Moneyball"" - one of those well-made movies about antiheroic but somehow very likable sportsmen that usually don't get a serious critical acclaim and don't get much out of Globes or Guilds or Oscars, but are widely recognized and praised by broad audiences. ""Creed"" is also one of those movies.",2015
3,"Before I begin I must say that Rocky is my favourite movie of all time. What made Rocky so gripping is the fact that the protagonist was a classic underdog striving to reach his potential and stand up to his critics and those who set out to humiliate him. It's a film about determination, passion and persistence and we get to follow him on this tough journey.",2015
5,"I still have a gamut of emotions watching Rocky 1,2,3 and 4 but this one left me wondering why it was so highly rated. I was not moved emotionally at all. The dialogue felt awkward and misplaced at times and forced at others. The first four movies were so well done that it seems like those things really happened. It is forever printed on my memory. I still sing songs from those Rocky movies all these years later. I am already forgetting much of this movie and I saw it last week. I can't even remember a single song from it. It really is that bad. I never thought it would be possible to make a ""Rocky"" movie worse than Rocky 5 but this one was worse. ",2015
1,"I decided to go see this movie because it got such high ratings. I wasn't far into the movie when I realized I'd probably wasted my time and money. I began to feel like walking out, which I haven't done in a long time, but I stayed just to see how much worse it could get. Everything seemed to play out just about as I expected, with a cliché here, and a bit of formula there. I saw nothing original or memorable about the movie, except for how painful it was to sit through the whole thing. I won't even risk saying anything that even resembles a spoiler, except to say to go ahead and use a bit of intuition after watching for 10-15 minutes to guess how it'll play out. If you're a thinking person's movie viewer you'll probably be mostly correct, bored out of your mind, and you'll also wonder why this movie got such high praise. I'm tempted to think it's a conspiracy... are there that many dullards out there?",2016
8,"By my own admission, I've never been a huge fan of the Rocky franchise. It took me years to watch Rocky and though I recognise it as a well crafted film, I was unable to fall in love with it like so many others have. Regardless of this, I found myself looking forward to Creed and hoping that, despite my disconnection from the Rocky franchise, it would stand on it's own as an entertaining film, and I'm pleased to say that not only was it able to do that, it also made me want to watch the previous entries which I originally had very little interest in.",2016
9,"This film will divide audiences and critics (as it already has; especially American and British ones), so it will be interesting to see whether it finds a market here in Australia. 'The Dressmaker' is the long awaited directorial return of Jocelyn Moorhouse. After 'Proof' was a major critical success in 1991, American features followed, but this is the first for Ms Moorhouse in nearly 2 decades. There is an audacious feel to this movie from start to finish and for me, an unexpected one. From the movie poster, this would seem like a period costume drama; well it is certainly set in a bygone era, and there is a panoply of amazing costumes, but this film is impossible to squeeze into a genre; making it a challenge to describe nor summarize.",2015
8,"Over the years there have been many quirky, eccentric characters featured in Australian films such as Muriel's Wedding, The Castle and Priscilla Queen of the Desert. The stories have been uniquely Australian to be appreciated by Australian audiences but occasionally they become worldwide hits like Crocodile Dundee. It's the laid-back Aussie humour that international audiences sometimes just don't understand which prevents the majority of Australian films from crossing the cultural barrier. The Dressmaker has been successful at the Australian box office for it features a story where the underdog or misunderstood succeeds along with a story that promotes the Aussie dry wit with dialogue that appeals to the everyday Australian.",2015
10,"Brilliant movie. Kate Winslet as the star lives the role so perfectly you forget she is not a native born Australian - her accent is flawless, her acting is raw and beautiful. The movie is heart wrenching, darkly funny, shocking and confronting all in a delightful way. Judy Davis is brilliant - irascible as Mad Molly, you gradually discover her depth and beauty. Again flawlessly played. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as always - several laugh out loud moments with him. He is the consummate actor and where someone else playing this role would have just been a plain unlikeable weirdo, Hugo makes you love him and his quirky nature. Liam Hemsworth is sweet and very watchable. The townsfolk played by many notable Australian actors are well played also. All in all a wonderful movie that will touch your heart in many ways. Liked it so much, I will definitely go and see it again. It's THAT good.",2015
9,"This is hands down the best film in the English language I've seen for at least two years. Not only does it do its source absolute justice, it adds a genuine, highly original Oz visual atmosphere to its themes. The cast is nothing short of amazing, with every single character bringing the utmost of their craft to the roles. Judy Davis delivers one of the best performances of her illustrious career, but Kate Winslet, Kerry Fox and Sarah Snook are also fantastic. Liam Hemsworth isn't just hotter than Chris, he's also the far more nuanced thespian. Hugo Weaving, one of the best actors of his generation, sinks his teeth into his beefy part of an exceedingly well-mannered cop in the 1950's Oz outback.",2016
8,"This movie is like a patchwork, little by little you get the whole picture, a really fine piece of work, Kate Winslet is great, Judy Davis simply brilliant, not to mention Hugo Weaving's performance, outstanding, I enjoyed every minute, never underestimate a woman, revenge is a dish best served cold, well in this particular case, sewed, you don't get it at the beginning, why is she dressed like this and what is she doing in such a forsaken place, not wanted at all, starting by her mother, than the battle begins, with a sewing machine (a Singer), determination and a lot of talent, a few golf club's, and the whole place is headlong, word for word, fasten your seat belt, this is going to be one kind of a ride",2016
8,"'The Dressmaker' is not the type of film that instantly attracts me to the cinema. It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.",2015

10,"Today I had the absolute pleasure of seeing a film I've been waiting about a decade for. 'The Dressmaker' is adapted from Rosalie Ham's bestselling Australian book which first came out in 2000, and I studied in high school about that long ago too. Ms Ham actually came and spoke at my school, and I can still remember her telling us that she was currently writing a screenplay of the book – but that she wasn't sure if the American production company would want the movie to be set in Australia or adapted to the bible-belt/deep south of America.",2015
7,"Well, that has to be the most conflicting movie experience I've ever known. I was invited to the premiere of The Dressmaker last night and I'm unsure whether I can say I loved it, hated it, thought it was hilarious, found it terribly sad, was frustrated because it was so weird or enjoyed it because some of the characters were so endearing - this movie caused all of these emotions and more. It's certainly entertaining - just so many roller-coaster sensations within the space of only a few minutes. A viewer will fluctuate continually between laughing raucously one minute only to find themselves experiencing deep sadness, anger, confusion or just plain asking yourself 'Why did they include this?' with the next breath. And they're a mix of the most quirky / weird / unlikeable / endearing / heartwarming characters I've ever seen / met. There was one character I didn't like at all, even though at some stages I still found myself laughing at some of their antics. I'm sure many readers will either disagree with me or think I'm referring to someone else - but that's okay, that's what makes us all different. The Dressmaker is definitely worth a look but not something I'd pay to see again - mainly because of the inclusion of that one character already referred to. This movie is very very dark in places and the ending is definitely not what you expect! The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded. A very big hats off to Kate for a wonderful portrayal of an Aussie accent - you would swear she is a true blue Aussie. I have never heard anyone who wasn't born here to pull off an Aussie accent with such authenticity as she showed in this. Proves her calibre as an actress and the exceptional talent of Victoria Mielewska, her dialogue coach. Added to all of this, the budget must have been huge as every single person involved was easily recognisable from another movie or TV series - and most of them big Aussie names. So don't bother asking me whether you should go and see it - you'll just have to go along and see for yourself - but I can almost guarantee it's definitely not at all what you'll be expecting. And interestingly, other ladies in two book clubs I am connected to said they felt exactly the same with both the book and the film.",2015
6,Kate Winslet and Judy Davis steal the whole movie. Liam Hemsworth is very nice on the eye. Everyone else is a caricature.,2015
7,"Based on the best-selling novel by Rosalie Ham, this comedy-drama is set in early 1950's Australia. It's a vibrant tale of revenge, mother- daughter bonds, small-town secrets and the great power of clothes, in a movie that is both bittersweet and funny and is dominated by a stunning, multi-layered performance from Kate Winslet. Jocelyn Moorhouse's latest feature is enjoyable enough and so unexpected, and let's be honest she also has a great team to help her achieve that. In few words, ""The Dressmaker"" is a dark comedy in Australian style, that will catch many by surprise, especially if you love clothes and fashion in general. nikisreviews.com",2016
9,"Ordinarily, I'd never consider seeing a movie titled ""The Dressmaker."" However, that was today's mystery movie for the monthly Camera Cinema Club in San Jose. If you'd told me that Kate Winslet could play the Clint Eastwood role in ""High Plains Drifter"" and that the movie would be reset to nowhere, Australia in 1951, I'd have said that would be an unlikely formula for a hit movie. I'm here to tell you that this is an exceptional and unusual movie with links to many outstanding films of the past, yet unique unto itself. Winslet has never been better in my opinion in this strong role and she's supported by a great cast with knockout performances especially by Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. This movie is filled with quirky characters sure to tickle your interest and funny bone. Yet it's not an all-out comedy. There's a serious amount of serious and a fair amount of tragedy. If you like your movies cut from a different cloth, ""The Dressmaker"" belongs on your must-see list.",2016
3,When this film started my early impressions of it were good; we have Kate Winslet arriving back in Australia very much playing against type as a 'bad-ass' women seeking revenge. Upon hearing her mutter the line 'I have a score to settle here' I thought Yes this is going to be a really good revenge film. I really couldn't have been more wrong....,2016
10,"THIS FILM IS INTENDED TO SHRED APART YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS!!! Do not go into watching this film with the idea that you are watching a tragedy. You may not connect with the majority of the characters. They may not feel entirely three dimensional. You may not empathise with them and you are not intended to. It is extraordinarily true that you do not get what you expected from the trailer of this film. However, what you will get will most definitely blow your mind whether you appreciate the artistry of such postmodern blurring of genres or not. It is important to note that many of the critics (but by all means all) whom have given bad reviews to this film, do not entirely understand the essence of genre itself. Whilst the Aristotelian theory of genre concludes that genre is a fixed ridged entity, whereby texts must possess specific content, form or features in order to belong to a selected genre, modern theorists understand that genre cannot be a fixed entity as these conventions are too narrow to classify all texts under. Genre is an extremely dynamic concept and changes or evolves along with it's context. Therefore, genre now - as a taxonomy of works - classifies texts according to their intended purpose, recurring priori actions as well as it's relationship with it's audience. Whilst The Dressmaker may initially present itself as a western film or even a Gothic film, this does not mean that the film is in that genre! The Dressmaker is a COMEDY. Indeed it possesses many MODES of other genres, however, the film intends to SATIRISE the attitudes modeled by many in 1950's Australia. And this - my dear friends ... and foe - is EXTREMELY CLEVERLY DONE!!!!! ",2016
8,"This movie was a great surprise. I figured it would be just a feel good ""cute"" romcom. Boy was I wrong. Yes it had the RomCom moments, but it had a very deep dark underlying river of a very good story. The ever Stunning Kate Winslet was top of her game in this film. She was stunning, beautiful, witty, charming, and just plain Bad ass. She worked it like no ones business. Her character was coming back for not only revenge but for peace in her own skin. Perfectly casted and perfectly executed. Liam Helmsworth....just plain delicious. Best of all was the ever FAB-U-LOUS Hugo Weaving back in the skirt again. He is just perfect in this film. With a taste of Priscilla Queen of the Desert it just doesn't get any better than Hugo. I see how this movie received standing ovations at film awards. It's worthy of it and more. Brilliant.",2016

1,"This was a disappointing film in virtually all respects. Strained acting, combined with a ridiculously unbelievable plot which was heavily overacted throughout. Don't get sucked in by flowery reviews if you are looking for an enjoyable, meaningful experience. This film lacks substance, struggles to be funny, and isn't consistent with the time frame that its set in. Rather it awkwardly tries to meld modern themes into a time and place where they don't belong and likely didn't exist! I'm 60 and grew up in Victoria so I have a pretty good idea. I Strongly recommend you look elsewhere for some worthwhile viewing. Maybe the late night movie?",2015

9,"Before deciding to write a review for The Dressmaker, I read a scathing review of the movie that called it a choppy dark comedy that was all over the place. I agree the movie is ""all over the place"", but it is for a very good reason. ""The Dressmaker"" is about facing one's past, and the Pandora's box of secrets and emotions that usually opens. It can also trigger new events, some great and some bad. It's how well one navigates through all of that determines how much said person heals when all of the dust settles, so that they can move on to their next chapter in life as whole a person as possible. And Winslet's character navigates well. I felt a surprising sense of healing after watching this movie. This movie gave me happy tears, and has helped me decide to finally go back and face my past.

It was every characters personal decisions that seamed the events and characters of this film in a jarring and exposed narrative of our human condition.",2016
9,"Towards the end of the movie, Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo asks, ""How's THAT for entertainment?"" (when teaching the movie's villain a lesson about monologuing), and my answer regarding this movie would have to echo Waverly's ""very good"", as this film manages to out-Bond the last two actual Bond films. While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in fact enjoyed Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to give this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this movie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing that sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in the 60s time period and not being ""modernised"". From the opening ""spy jazz"" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie's unique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and he proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending humor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly amusing torture sequence I've seen since Bond's in Casino Royale). Whilst there are ""talky"" moments and occasions where the camera lingers on a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow restless during, there's also action (but not such that it's overkill) mixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment. It all combines extremely well.",2015
8,"Never watched the show, so can't compare the two, or whether or not this is a faithful adaptation of it or not, but I loved this film. It perfectly rides the fine line between straight 1960s spy movie throwback, and satire of one.",2016
10,"As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the pre-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD.

All I could go on were the words from my wise mother who stated, ""I used to watch that show when I was a kid back in the 60's. It starred.....oh what's his name.....Robert Vaughan.""

It was a witty, and smart movie where each actor didn't outshine one another. I personally do not trust critics since they tend to like boring movies like 'The Lincoln Lawyer' that put me to sleep. It's almost as if the movie was too witty for them & the quips and snarky comments went over their daft heads and left a sour taste in their mouths.",2015
1,Wow! Did not expect this.,2015
1,"Sucked. Nearly walked out half way through. Dull. Lead male and female miscast. Poorly written. I went based on this is a ""Guy Ritchie"" film. Unfortunately it falls flat with weak dialogue and a innocuous, cliché premise. Yes, there are a few good action scenes, but they are distractingly pasted to the first and third act in a way that really begs for a more sophisticated plot. I feel sorry for the talent... thinking they were in a ""Guy Ritchie"" movie. In a way, Hugh Grant nearly steals the movie because he's the only one with a bit of character. The rest are too shallow to care whether they return for another scene in the simple-minded, hardly funny, plot (?)",2015

3,"SPOILERS! Just saw this movie. Like Avengers 2, if you love bad jokes and don't have a brain you'd probably enjoy it. This movie was PACKED with bad scenes, story, small-talk and ""hot- angles"" of hunks and a petite girl. This movie is truly for small minded people. ",2015
8,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - Not Bourne, not Bond, but a new code name. Rather a good one - 3.75 stars ",2015
3,"was one of the movies i was looking forward too, enjoyed the likes of helicopter spies etc. Started to watch, what hit me was how poor the acting was - so wooden. the storyline was terrible, one not to watch again.",2015
4,Style over substance is how I would describe The Man From U.N.C.L.E. as that often used expression is the first thing that comes to my mind as I dwell on the character of Napoleon Solo as played by Henry Cavill. Though he is supposed to be the main character he never goes beyond a superficial caricature of James Bond. On the other hand the characters of Ilya and Gaby become more human as the movie goes on. Napoleon Solo on the other hand remains glib. He could practically not be in the movie at all as the story revolves around the romance of Ilya and Gaby and I now struggle to remember what Napoleon Solo was doing in the movie at all.,2015
6,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has been a big box office bomb, which it didn't deserve to be. Guy Ritchie's flashy and pleasingly retro spy thriller is a fun ride but it lacks any kind of genuine punch. It's a very generic spy plot which is given lift by being set during the Cold War and involving the CIA's best agent (Henry Cavill) and the KGB's best agent (Armie Hammer) working together. Overall TMFU is a moderate success. Guy Ritchie's direction is visually excellent and unlike the 2 Sherlock Holmes films (Which were good but not exactly Sherlock Holmes) his style fits the movie perfectly. The acting is good all around, with Armie Hammer improving on his fairly generic performance in The Lone Ranger although Henry Cavill occasionally comes across as a bit smug. Despite being set in a different time period the film manages not to feel anachronistic and serves up plenty of sleek entertainment. Ultimately this is basically just lots of style with little substance although the Cold War setting makes it more interesting.",2015
4,"The film opens with a delightful throw back to the days of the iron curtain. The opening chase sequence is brilliant through out.Guy Ritchie has brilliantly used his narrative style to get Solo (Henry Cavill, American Spy) & Illya (Armie Hammer, Russian) to show off their skills in the trade craft. It was refreshing to watch the two super spies in action.",2015
1,"I started to look at my watch after about half an hour in to this awful film. I call it the watch test, if I am straining to see the dial on my watch to see how much longer it goes on for, it is going to be a bad movie. Will I be able to endure the torture or will I spring out of my seat and walk out. I never look at my watch in a good movie, because time goes quickly. The film has no proper story, is badly directed, badly acted and just about as exciting as watching paint dry.",2015
4,Very dull and boring movie. with a lot of forced jokes.,2015
3,"37 minutes was all I lasted. Apart from the opening action scene which, as is usual for this type of film, has little to do with the rest of the story, nothing else happened to the point I lost the will to carry on. Given Guy Richie's previous films have generally been excellent and is the only director to have ever made Jason Statham look like an actor I am both surprised and disappointed that I got to the point of quitting. Style seems to have been the only consideration rather than telling a story.",2015
3,"If you are a fan of Guy Richie, Henry Cavill or Hugh Grant, do not go and see this movie.",2015
9,"The show got an amazing story .. the plot is so original and catchy , upping the level of Thrill and Drama as this could be one of the best Summer/Fall shows this year.",2015
10,I'll make this short.,2017
10,"If they don't choose to make this into a show I'm going to boycott Amazon.. Simply Amazing. It felt so real, so raw, you could truly feel the stress and excitement the entire way thru this pilot episode.",2016
9,"Somehow in the end Sneaky Pete achieves pretty much everything it says on the box, and everything it hints at in the pilot. It's a con movie, and a brilliant one at that, while being a dysfunctional family drama at the same time, and also being brilliant at that. It's simply an extremely well written and acted show that somehow manages to spin about five B-plots, three C-plots and a main arc into a riveting story that never seems forced one bit, and always feels as if the writers let the characters be true to themselves rather than deus-ex-machina them into a better story. And yet the story is pretty much perfect in the end. ",2017
9,"This is an excellent mystery, crime drama, con game series. I think folks are learning that the 1 hour, 2 story crime drama format used in the US for the last 20 years might not always be the best. This story is told over numerous episodes with numerous plot twists. Unraveling as they go. The characters appear cold and unattached but you get attached and they get attached over the series. The show works on a few different levels. You, I end up cheering for the bad guys.....or are they good guys? I found the plot twists and their ability to twist my view very entertaining! The first 2 episodes are the slowest and the last 4 or so are the fastest, you can't stop watching! Truly, those last ones are cliff hangers, each one.",2017
8,the pilot was close to brilliant and it makes you wonder what the delay was with the decision to give it a whole season. Unfortunately the new episodes feel different compared to the pilot and not in the best way. ,2017
10,"Great storyline concept. Clever writing. Brilliantly acted. Knowing little about the series, I tuned in for Margo Martindale. I love her ability to be gentle and nurturing, then turn into a no nonsense truth sayer. This series offers so much more than that! Sneaky Pete keeps you guessing and pulls you in. A fine tale that weaves together family, desperation and criminal thinking when it comes to protecting your loved ones. I love a show that doesn't show it's full hand right away. There were times when my husband and I audibly gasped at a turn of events in a scene. It is totally binge worthy. We finished up the series today, instead of watching football (a first for us).",2017
10,I just finished watching season one and was just blown away from episode one thru to episode ten. What's even better is that I just found out that there will be a second season. This series really has everything which is why I easily gave it a 10.,2017
6,"The aesthetics, direction, acting, and cinematography are on point. Very well done all around. However, the show makes shoe-horned in ""a-thousand-ways-for-Pete-to-be- 'sneaky"" in each episode. It's is tiresome and contrived. What started off with true promise has been over-saturated with melodrama that never reconciles what the pilot promised. They should have made the stakes bigger, and slowly built upon them-like Pete ingratiating himself into the family could have been more complex than just showing up at the door. It's hard to say where the showrunners went wrong in one post. But they are clearly Astro-turfing this with high ratings. They force- feed tangential story-lines down the audiences throats in every episode like it's CSI (whatever city). I got 7 episodes in and I am done. Pass.",2017
3,"Boring characters, who are impossible to care about.",2017
10,"This show is Abso-friggin-lutely hands down one of THE Best shows to come out recently! Why Amazon only purchased 1 season is beyond me, but I am confident they will follow suit with a couple more at the very minimum!",2017
5,"Sneaky Pete was originally offered to CBS, who turned it down before Amazon gave it a home. This much is apparent from the show's storytelling, as it pads out what could have been a two hour film into a 10 hour series with diverting subplots and busy work to keep supporting characters spinning. There are times when you sense that it would be too quick for characters to move from A to B, so they have them tread water with narrative contrivances (eg the parole officer who has a decent amount of time committed to his presence and then abruptly disappears midway through the show). ",2017
10,"A show that stays interesting from beginning to end. There's no lengthy character setup; within 10 minutes you're into it. I love these impostor type shows. Orphan Black is another similar show. Unlike that show however, this one doesn't have an incredibly unlikable brother. The villain owns every scene he's in. When you see who plays him you'll see why.",2017
6,"This show has something of the beauty of Justified and even Breaking Bad, and while the tension build up is quite interesting and final plot it's just absurd... First 9 episodes were somewhat believable, even if after a while you got tired that everything gets solved in the very last minute",2017
7,"Some film buffs seem to think this series is extraordinary. I'd agree if the criteria of quality was good acting and clever structure. The series expertly develops the obstacle/solution flow-through style necessary for those movies that follow the Holy Grail of Hollywood writing. It also does an excellent job of pacing and interweaving various subplots. However, I thought some episodes got bogged down in cleverness for cleverness sake, and did little to maintain interest. Although the major trope of the movie was the art of the con, I thought some characters acted way to naive considering their level of sophistication and their professions. Was this series riveting because it was interesting or because audience members wanted to find out what happened next so they could just finish watching so they could move onto something else? That would be a good question to ask yourself whether you've already seen the series or plan to see it.",2017
1,"I feel let down by the whole show. The plot is preposterous. There are bigger holes than the Grand Canyon (I'm not exaggerating) We are made to believe that a young woman in between running a household full of kids grandparents and siblings is a bounty hunter for her grannies bail bond agency.(Yes. Her Grannies)Pete turns up at the front door and says "" Hi. I'm Pete, your grandson that you haven't seen in twenty years"", to which they say. "" Come in Pete and have a glass of lemonade"", without querying it as he looks totally different from the real Pete. Giovanni Ribisi is miscast as the hero and Cranston is terrible The biggest fault with the show is you just don't care for any of the characters. Definitely not going to sneak a look at any more episodes",2017
6,"This show finally premiered a couple of weeks ago on Amazon and I have just finished season one of Sneaky Pete and I did enjoy it to a certain extent but there is definitely some poor things in this show. The premise of the show sees a con man getting out of prison taking his cell mates name in an attempt to get $100,000 dollars for his old mob boss. Giovanni Ribisi plays Pete in this show and he does a really good job in this show. You care about his character as you see him attempt to make the best out of this situation in many different creative ways. He has good humour to him and does a good job in the dramatic scenes he has to do. Peter Gerety and Margo Martindale play his grandparents on this show and at first I didn't really care about them but as the show progresses they become allot more interesting and you end up caring about their situation. Bryan Cranston plays the mob boss Vince and I thought he delivered a good performance even though his character is incredibly cliché. He is easily the best actor on this show I just kind of wish he had more to do. When it comes to the rest of Pete's family I just did not like them at all, whether it is the cousin who is a police officer or the stuck up uptight cousin or the young stoner niece. None of them are interesting and they each get their own story arcs which I really didn't care about at all. The story has allot of cogs moving in it, the stuff involving Pete's big con with Vince is pretty interesting and like any show as more things are revealed you get more invested in the story. But as mentioned before some of the supporting story arcs are just incredibly dull and even a little confusing at times. I just wish there had been more interesting sub plots in this show. The script has some well done humour and drama but really nothing stands out as very memorable which does hurt it. The style of the film has some pretty cool con scenes that seem pretty plausible and it is fun to see. However, I don't really feel it was used enough and we could have had a few less story arcs and a few more cons. Overall this is an alright show that means I might give season 2 a shot but I won't be too excited for it.",2017
7,"I had mixed feelings about this show. For sure it contains some genius, very good ideas are spread all around the plot. But, I don't know why, very often I found myself checking for how long the episode was going to last, and that is not a good thing at all. But the last episodes do not suffer from this flaw and the ending is good. This is just a start (even though it has a complete story line) the characters are very well portrayed, the acting is high level, it is a good foundation for the future series (that for sure are ready for production, considering the last minutes of the last episode). My final evaluation is 7½, downgraded to 7 here on IMDb because in Italy, without any reason that I can understand, there is no Prime Video app for Playstation 4, so I was forced to use the app from my 2012 TV, that perform just decently, nothing compared to the Netflix app of the console.",2017
7,"Until the final episode I rated this an eight. Clever story, good acting and well produced. On the negative side, I doubt if Pete could have ever attracted the good looking women that he did: he's not exactly George Clooney, is he?!",2017
7,"Though maybe not the best, absolutely not bad either. I'd sit on a 7.5. I think reviews here are often based on a Pilot, perhaps 2 episodes, and I feel people are too friendly in their opinions.",2017
9,"Great storyline with some great unpredictable twists along the way. Binge watched it because it really hooked me in. Watched the pilot a few weeks ago, then was just waiting for the rest of the episodes to come out.",2017
3,"This began so promisingly; it was full of potential and had some great people in the cast. Unfortunately that was squandered and thinking back I'm not sure if it was steady decline, a sudden change or if I'd just overlooked the faults for a while following the strong pilot. Regardless at some point it all suddenly felt like the show had been taken away from talented people who cared and handed over to a crew whose only prior experience was producing dreadful, glossy and shallow soap operas.",2017
8,Sneaky Pete if the show keep everyone on it specially Bryan.breaking bad as the evil one ..that show maybe one of the most entertainment series for the family .it has good story great lines so we want more..first episode ,2016
2,"This did not do it for me. Predictable and over-used subject. I'm also over the acting of Giovanni, he has zero range, always acting in his same style. Watch one of his acts and you've seen them all. Maybe that has something to do with Scientology? See the same traits in Cruse, Alley, etc. Travolta may be the exception. If it wasn't for Bryan Cranston's involvement in this series I probably would not have gone past the first episode. Marin Ireland has a nice future in movie, she's real good. Margo Martindale is always a pleasure to watch. She has some reality in her acting and you can relate to her roles they way she portrays them. Peter Gerety has had a long and steady acting career and he does his role justice in this otherwise sleepy series.",2017
10,This show is so incredible from start to finish! I watched season 1 completely in one day. I couldn't stop. The acting is incredible. The writing of the story and plot is insane! I literally don't know how people can come up with it. Must watch!,2018
10,"I find it refreshing to watch a show where the main cast is not overly made up, naked and dramatic, chasing men and talking about fantasy love from fairy tales. It is just a really well made story with a nice cast and plot where women can reflect on our new stance in society and the realities we tend to deny. I love how each role has a normal type and depicts the average life and human desires without going over the top with drama and grotesque scenes. I like how fresh, amusing, casually, and simple the story and its characters just show us a good time and the ironies of being a woman in today's world. The young and older woman with its perks and difficulties,goods and bads. Thumbs up!",2015
9,"I'm not sure if this is true for others, but the first review that comes up for me describes the show as unrealistic and promoting sleeping around, lying, and other debauchery- the main complaints I've seen about this show seem to be that it promotes sex, lying, sleeping around etc. or is ageist and sexist. What these reviewers seem to believe is that the show is either a guide to life that must teach morals directly, or that it is apparently not a tongue-in- cheek comedy using stereotypes to make social commentary in a humorous way. It is not a how-to guide on being a woman in today's world, and since it isn't a children's show, I don't see why anyone would be concerned that the characters are not all traditionally moral, conservative individuals. I, personally, prefer characters that make mistakes, grow, learn, and change, and have diverse viewpoints. This show has that, and for what it's worth, the main protagonist is neither 'slutty' nor wildly amoral and evil, but is instead rather 'normal' and sympathetic.",2015
9,"Generally, the previews interested me. Contemporary, fun, includes the older and younger generation? Very cool! Being a woman, I can see how this would appeal to my gender, but anyone can enjoy it really. I couldn't stop watching after the first episode. It's a bit liberal for my taste, I haven't seen other shows besides Hot in Cleveland on TV Land, but even with the ""adult-situations"" it's easy to watch, and there's a charm to it that sets it apart from new shows these days. Great actors and actresses for the main roles, Hilary Duff was what drew me in in the first place, but a good show wouldn't be good without who's in it! Just watch, be free, and enjoy it!",2015
9,"This show is fun and touches on the challenges of getting older while reminding us to stay young at heart. The main character is a women going through a mid life crisis who is forced to reinvent herself after going thru a divorce to a world that sees her as being washed up, out of touch, and unattractive to the job market and dating scene. Instead of accepting peoples'stereotypes she does a makeover of her life and re brands herself as a energetic highly skilled 26 year old. Too many people as they get older become plagued with responsibility and this show reminds people to get out and live life. We all have a lot of life left to live. We are only as old as we let ourselves be. This show reminds us to live life to the fullest. We cannot let stereotypes tell us what we can and cannot do. Love this show as it is well written and gives people the confidence to make changes and take chances. Highly recommended feel good show.",2015
7,"So, I have heard this show being compared to Sex and the City numerous times. I wouldn't necessarily go there. Sure, it's created by Darren Star and the actors are beautifully dressed by the great Patricia Fields. And sure, they live in New York, but those are the only things they have in common with SATC. Is that a bad thing? Not in this case. Younger is fun and addicting. The cast is relatable and interesting to watch. Sutton Foster is perfect. Her acting is superb. The rest of the main cast does a great job at supporting her. The chemistry between ""Liza"" and ""Josh"" is wonderful to watch. These days I find myself catching a new show and they get to the point too quickly. I like how this show doesn't do that. And not in the sense that it is dragging on, but that there are so many possibilities and you cannot help but get excited to see what happens next. On another review, I saw someone say it was refreshing. That is the perfect word for this show! My only two gripes are that I feel a couple of characters don't belong and they lack chemistry with the rest of the cast. I also wish the series was a full hour. 30 minutes is just a tease for my emotions. So, there you have it. Forget the book club ladies. Grab your wine and gather with your girls to watch this. You will not be disappointed. Especially with all of the hotness on the show.",2016
7,People are getting way into these shows and start analyzing them way too deep.,2015
2,"I've always thought that a show about washed-up, useless, outdated, tired, worthless, unappealing, out-of-touch, unattractive, invisible, over-the-hill, moronic women over thirty would be hysterical. Especially when they try to regain some sense of self-worth by pretending to be 26, instead of demonstrating competence, confidence and intelligence. I can hardly contain myself. After all, who wants some old hag working for them. And, twenty-somethings already know everything, so what's to gain by hanging out with, or god forbid, respecting anyone over 30. But, if they are stupid enough to think the much older looking Sutton Foster is 26, then maybe they aren't as smart as they think they are. And bully for her for wanting an inked-up, pierced loser over an age-appropriate man for a sex partner, because why shouldn't she perpetuate the very thing that she and her also over 40 best friend are complaining about. My stomach hurts from laughing so hard. The real comedy would be if anyone over 26 was responsible for getting this garbage on the air, because according to them, they are decades past relevant.",2015
10,"I'm so glad I found Younger. I had seen Sutton Foster on an episode of ""Say Yes To The Dress"", and was glad to see she's starring in her own show. The cast is perfect and of course NYC is the best. I like the premise and especially Liza (Sutton) who at times seems a wise 20 something, and then a few minutes later every bit a mature 40 year old woman. The story line and characters are excellent and I've even grown to feel comfortable with her relationship with Josh (Nico). Now that he knows her true age, it brings a whole new dimension into things. All the supporting actors are perfectly cast. I hadn't really seen Hillary Duff in anything before but I really like her in this. The new season can't come soon enough! Great show TVLAND.",2015
1,"I am a huge fan of Sutton Foster and I think the premise of the show is fun and interesting. However, it's pretty crude as most things are nowadays. But, I've been willing to look past that because I thoroughly enjoy Ms. Foster. The most recent episode had Matthew Morrisom as a guest star. Having also been a fan of his, I looked forward to this week's episode. The whole episode was the best I'd seen in regard to sexual content and his character was just adorable. Until the end, when he was having sex with a sheep. Beastiality is disgusting, animal abuse and just wrong. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor after that moment. I couldn't believe Younger would include this. It wasn't funny. And now I don't think I can watch Matthew Morrison again. As a result, I will not be watching again. Just gross. I hope the show gets cancelled and soon. Sutton Foster- you're better than this drivel and disgusting show.",2016
9,"Oh come on get a life nay sayers! Show is adorable and shot for 25-60 year old male or females. Very cute premise and spot on casting. If you don't like chick flicks or rom-coms this is not for you!! Sutton Foster is truly a 40 year old who looks 26 & is smoking hot! She pulls off the part perfectly and kicks in enough spice to definitely heat this up a remind you just how sexy a 40 year old can be. Debi Mazar is the perfect sidekick & Hillary Duff kicks in just the right amount of naiveté to her role. I think this show will really start to gel as everyone grows into their rolls. It should have been written as an hour show. Just as the episode starts to hit stride, poof, see ya next week.",2015
8,I will admit that I was skeptical at first about this show but after the first episode I was totally hooked. It's about a middle aged woman in her 40s (well a 40 year old) that lies about being 26 to get a job that she wants. The interesting concept is how long can she keep living a lie to the people she grew close to personally and professionally. I think it's a very lighthearted and funny series that people can relate to. I also love the whole NYC (living life freely in the city) vibes I'm getting (I'm a NY girl lol) plus I love the fact that some of the scenes show some NY landmarks as well. I definitely can't wait for season 2.,2016
3,"When I was 40 I looked and felt younger than Sutton Foster and never for one minute felt technologically and culturally challenged next to my 20 something friends. Is that what it's coming down to today that even 40 year old women feel like dinosaurs? Or maybe the message here is that we should. To me, Sex and the City felt empowering. This show is depressing. I am 56 and even at my age I don't want to be told I am out of it for being older. In my own mind I am much younger. It's what you feel, anyway. This character acts and feels older than I do. It's unrealistic. I can't imagine how 40 year old women would feel about someone their age who doesn't know how to set up a Twitter account. Isn't that insulting? Even I know how to do that! This is just a show that confirms age-ist stereotypes. I suppose we're supposed to think it's cute but I just find it depressing.",2015
2,"For starters, I couldn't even watch the entire pilot episode. I turned it off after only 15 minutes (including commercials.) This show is about as funny as a TV ad for ""Vagisil."" And at least as tacky. I tuned in because the premise of a 40-something woman passing herself off as 26 to get a job is new and sounds like it could have really good comic potential. After all, the ""Fish Out of Water"" story is a staple of comedy on TV and in movies. Plus, the technology changes over the past 14 years provide a lot of ""techno-clash"" material to work with, not to mention the inherent ""culture clash"" in the premise. And with Hillary Duff as a principle character, how could it possibly go wrong? Well, it did go wrong. Very wrong. This show is tasteless and classless. Perhaps with a little re-thinking of its concept, this show could be funny. I like the basic idea. But I won't be tuning in to find out what happens next.",2015
1,"Leave it to TV Land to come up with such an empowering show for women. Especially if you are 40 and over. To think, if you are the typical out-of-touch Neanderthal over 40, all you have to do is look like, talk like, and act like a whore and everyone will think you're 26 and thankfully relevant again. Who knew empowerment was so easy. To pass for young, promiscuity, irresponsibility, and narcissism are the tickets. Think of all those years we wasted educating ourselves and working hard. We should have just been drinking jello shots and spreading our legs. Thanks TV Land for giving us hope and showing us the way. I have my eye on a managers job here, so I just purchased a whole bunch of bananas to practice on. CEO here I come!",2015
10,"When a TV series is a smash hit you have the options of eagerly waiting for every episode but always the second option of understanding why. Brilliant, timely and enticing are three words coming to mind. Considering the recent trends of former suburbanites moving back to hot New York neighborhoods such as one in Brooklyn the focus of the show's setting and others finding it difficult to get work in fields in which hiring of twenty somethings now takes preference. Almost every episode has something I can hang on to as one performer told to say the line ""The secret of aging gracefully is not trying everything new but knowing when to give up the familiar. Some TV land produced series tried this format but failed due to uninteresting character interaction scripted, single camera format to save money making the half hour episode visually uninteresting and using the cogent topic as a springboard to give characters a spin less interesting than following it up. This one is any time as close to television situation comedy perfection as was the long running hit series it replaced,HOT IN CLEVELAND.",2016
3,"I give the show a 3 for the premise and that's about it. The show is more out of touch than the main character. 40 year old's in this day and age, even 50 year old's have been using social media and technology almost their whole adult life. To paint them as being this out of touch is ridiculous, and degrading to a woman, parent and human being. Especially since she has a daughter her age in the series; having a child that age keeps a person that age, keeps an adult even more connected to the youth pulse in society.",2016
2,"The premise and cast have so much promise but unfortunately, the show falls flat by very, very bad writing. The lead character is a 40 year old, posing as a 26 year old who is completely baffled by technology, the internet and iPhones. Such an absurd premise considering that all of the above were invented by men in their 50s and 60s. The younger characters are all cliché. Every woman under 30 is a bar hopping slut with no real self- control or ambition. Every woman over 40 is a desperate, mentally ill husband hunter. If they fired the show runner and hired a new team of writers, this show could be a hit. It's such a shame that is is destined for failure since the lead character is adorable and such a talent. I can only imagine what she could do with great material. The directing is above average and production is functional.",2015
1,"This show is awful. 40 year old has to pretend to be 26 to get a job. Seriously?! 40 year-old is so over the hill and out of touch she understands absolutely nothing techie because, of course, she's still trying to come to terms with what smartphones and tablets are. They might as well have had her dressed like Grandma Moses knitting a sweater with her teeth falling out. It is not funny. I did not laugh once during the first show. It is constantly promoting sex. No qualms about lying or sleeping around. When Hillary Duff is the smartest and classiest lady in the show you know something is wrong. Sutton Foster is annoying and comes off as the over the hill idiot. She DOES NOT LOOK 26 AT ALL. The millenials on the show act like a bunch of self absorbed brats. OMG hanging out with a mature 40 year old woman... Like TOTES PATHETIC!! Topless Tuesday??? Really??!! God what is this world coming too if this is a real thing?? This show stinks big time. How about a show on how to be a smart classy woman at whatever age? Sutton Foster should be ashamed of herself.",2015
1,"Everything Blacklister said is spot on. Hillary Duff is not a great actress, but, even she sounds bored doing this no class show. It's one half step above ""reality"" TV...maybe. The only thing funny is the concept that anyone could be fooled by Sutton Foster pretending to be 26...or attractive...or funny. TVLAND's constant barrage of commercials trying to subliminally make viewers watch this junk is the biggest joke. It doesn't belong on TVLAND, nor does that even dumber show, Teachers. Maybe some obscure ""Sex and the City"" rerun channel, like E! Jesus, I need 10 lines to describe this show? How many ways can I say, ""It's awful."" without being redundant. TVLAND's new direction is sad and slightly disturbing. At least that other stupid ""new direction"" channel, ABC Family, had the decency to FINALLY change their name.",2016
1,"TVLand wants to be taken seriously as a cable network and not just be the home of reruns of classic shows. But why give the audience a fake Sex and the City when the real show was one hundred times better? Younger is about a fortyish single mom going back to the workforce. But there's a catch: she changes her appearance to look twenty-six. Seriously? This is the storyline? This sounds like a plot that the Disney channel cooked up: stupid but hopefully the audience can suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Well, as a fortysomething, I found the show more offensive than funny. We were the first generation to embrace computers and portable phones, so to see Sutton Foster (who deserves better than this) struggle with creating a Twitter page or a smartphone is just plain insulting. And I know I'll offend some Lizzie McGuire fans, but Hollywood, PLEASE stop trying to make Hilary Duff happen. She can't act. Period. TVLand, just bring back Hot in Cleveland already. It's cheesy, but watchable compared to this garbage.",2016

I laughed the whole time as well as related to the characters and the concept and I'm in my 30's! I really thought this show was clever, smart and funny! My only complaint is that her shiny blue/silver/ pink makeup does not make her look younger but older, and not because she looks older, she is beautiful! However joshes tats look great! ( I'm a makeup artist based out of Nola so I notice such things) but really look forward to seeing a lot more of this show!!!!",2015

8,This film is a fictionalized story of a woman caught up in the suffrage movement in Britain in the early 20th century. Carry Mulligan plays Maud Watts...a woman who slowly comes into the movement and the sacrifices she personally made as a result.,2016
7,"It can be risky critiquing a film homage to heroines of feminism, especially one with a star cast that includes Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Ben Whishaw and a Meryl Streep cameo. Respect for the cause, however, does not guarantee respect for the film, and this one chooses a very limited lens with which to view this episode of history. It does have high production values, narrative authenticity and sensitivity for the feminist struggle in early 20th century Britain. But it gets lost in balancing the broader sweep of history that shapes gender relations and the impact of particular individuals.",2016
7,"Whilst most men would agree that giving women the vote was a dreadful mistake (put that stone down ladies. it's just a joke), the astonishing story behind the UK social upheaval that was the Suffragette movement is well overdue a serious cinematic treatment. And a serious treatment Sarah Gavron's new film most certainly is: you exit the cinema feeling about as wrung out as the linen in the heroine Maud's workhouse-style laundry.",2015
5,"After watching Suffragette for the second time I had hoped to have formed a different opinion, initially I left the cinema feeling bored and underwhelmed. The problem I'd say I have with it is that I find it strangely vacuous, on no level can I connect with it, or any of its characters. That is not to say that I find the acting bad, indeed far from it, there are some cracking performances, Carey Mulligan, Anne Marie Duff and for the amount she's actually in it, Helena Bonham Carter. Mulligan delivers frustration and despair well, she loses her family, her job, dignity and lashes out on her pig of a boss.",2016
5,"Solid performances, great period design, and a historical event worth telling. Unfortunately, the script is clichéd, giving us two stock characters -- the Radicalized Innocent and the Worldly Wise Secret Policeman -- who go through their expected paces. You could probably tell the same story today with a European Muslim in the Carey Mulligan role.",2015

5,"For those who are unfamiliar with the history of the women's suffrage movement in Britain, director Sarah Gavron and screenwriter Abi Morgan have reminded us that the more radical participants did not follow the non-violent civil disobedience program as promoted by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s Civil Rights movement here in America. Quite the contrary, the suffrage movement leader in Britain, Emmeline Parnkhurst (played by Meryl Streep in a brief cameo), called for violent protest. And as the film makes clear, the violent nature of the protests escalated from broken shop windows to bombs thrown into mailboxes, clashes with police and even the arson torching of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George's summer home.",2015
1,"As expected from the famous, wealthy, and successful white female actresses in the movie, the acting was quite good. For those familiar with the infamous Patricia Arquette Oscar speech, you will notice that several of these exceedingly wealthy, famous, privileged, white women were the ones giving a standing ovation after that speech.",2015
5,"Not as expected. A bit of a waste of great resources and actors who sadly didn't make me feel much. Despite their best efforts with good performances, there's something lacking in this film, the emotion is just not there. Something doesn't work, maybe the script but I had high hopes and I couldn't wait to see this film and now I feel like I haven't missed out on anything special.The story also is a bit sketchy.It's a shame this was a great opportunity to show and probably educate many people about how hard it has been to make progress in certain aspects of history. Unfortunately it falls short of history background.A missed opportunity on the director's part.",2015
1,"Another user here put it best when saying it is ""a fundamentalist feminist glossing over of a nuanced historical series of events, which fails to show the real work for equal voting rights (which most people, men included, did not have at this point in history) was done by the suffragISTS (not the suffragettes), composed of men & women, who lobbied for 1 person = 1 vote...rather than the openly racist suffragettes who only wanted white, upper class women to have the vote. At this point in history, usually only white, upper class men holding large property holdings could vote (although some women holding equivalent property, for example widows running a business, with a number of employees could and DID vote.)""",2015

Most of the major events I've read about historically on the movement's road to enfranchisement are covered in the film, like the letterbox campaign, attack on Lloyd George's house, their hunger strike and resultant force-feeding in prison and most famously the shocking martyrdom of Emily Davidson who ran onto Epsom racecourse on Derby Day in front of the King's horse, are all depicted, the latter very realistically.

8,"Scripted by Abi Morgan, who gave us THE IRON LADY four years ago, this is a finely judged snapshot of a key year (1912-13) in the decades-long battle for women to get the vote in England. Meryl Streep has brief but commanding appearances as cranky old Mrs Pankhurst, imperiously redirecting her campaign from the ruling class to the working class. The key character here is the fictitious Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), a young laundrywoman and mother who is drawn into the new campaign of 'civil disobedience', which will soon include blowing up post boxes and cutting telegraph wires.

6,"""Suffragette"" is a British 105-minute movie that was initially considered one of the big players during awards season, but came surprisingly short in pretty much all areas. And that includes Carey Mulligan playing the lead character, a young woman who gets sucked in by England's women's movement in the early 20th century. It is all about getting the right to vote. Helena Bonham Carter plays one of the major supporting players and Meryl Streep appears in one scene during which she gives a speech to the women listening to her. The director is Sarah Gavron and maybe she is not yet good enough to deal with such a star-studded cast as the outcome was a bit underwhelming given the material she had in terms of the cast.",2016
3,"""Suffragette"" is the kind of film that races past many other probable Oscar contenders to get in theaters, giving you the impression of its esteemed quality, until you sit down and watch it to realize it's a mediocre representation of an important part of history in an already crowded sea of adult drama. Overlong, underwritten, and messily shot throughout, this is a film more concerned with tugging the heartstrings of the viewers than attempting to detail the scope and impact of a significant movement in the long, arduous pursuit of gender equality.",2015

Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a young mother working in a laundry for most of her life. She suffered under her lascivious boss Mr. Taylor. Co-worker Violet Miller recruits her into the movement. After testifying to Minister Lloyd George, the government still refuses to give the vote. Maud is beaten and arrested along with MP wife Alice Haughton (Romola Garai), Violet and Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter). Police inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson) leads the effort to suppress the rebels. Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) urges the women to fight.

I had the same feeling when I was watching Suffragette.

10,"As we struggle and grapple with contemporary inequality issues – race, the economic divide, gay rights, etc – it is well to see this film, reminding us that it has been less than a century since women's rights were recognized and women made equal to men in voting, parental rights (if not economic equality.) and presence in politics and entertainment. Abi Morgan's script is excellent as is Sarah Gavron's direction, and with the superlative support of a cast of gifted actors this film breathes reality, memory, and reminders of a status struggle of the fairly recent past.",2016
6,"At the end of the movie, the claim was made that in 1920 women gained the right to vote in the United States. This is inaccurate. Only White women gained this right. Black women didn't get the right to vote until the 1960s. This fact should have been clarified. ",2017

The film is classified within the film biography, historical drama and assumed everyone cares should watching it, especially if he is interested in civil rights and freedoms, and of course all women must thank suffragette at least by reading the history and know these women who faced tradition and law and order and the king for the rights of all women. Vote For Women. The film, of course, the task is not an abstract in the tale underline the organization, but an inspiration to defenders of freedoms and rights that the road is still long and that they were only the first step.

From the stunning Cornwall scenery, to the careful attention to detail in the interior sets and locations, to costumes that range from the ragged to the rich, to the glorious music, and their wonderful choices for casting, especially the brilliant and charismatic Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark, this production has proved to be satisfying for people who have never seen the 70s version or read the novels it is based on, as well as those who have done either or both.

I was a bit skeptical that they could remake such a classic but I am pleasantly surprised and how much I am loving this show so far. Aidan portrays Ross Poldark so well and is hot hot hot to say the least. The girl who plays Demelza (sorry her name escapes me at present) is great. I remember her from The White Queen mini-series and was impressed with her then. I was totally enthralled from beginning to end. The chemistry between Ross & Demelza is amazing, just how it should be. This series is well casted and well written. I am hooked! Hope it is around for a long long time. I am definitely a fan.",2015

10,"I watched a little of the adaptation made in the 1970's but found the lead actor rather lame, though Anghared Rees was splendid. This time, its simply superb. Well cast and directed, with sumptuous Cornish scenery, the first episode introduces the main characters with a great deal of skill. We are not shown everything and not all is obvious, so there is an element of guesswork for the viewer, which always adds to the enjoyment. I can't wait for episode 2 and the others. Its fabulous, and shows how very skillful the team who put this together are. The narrative has strong sub texts which add richness to the feel of this and the acting is very fine. The whole experience was rich, costume and storyline, suspense and symbolism of the man who will not take hand-outs but instead, chooses to make his own way despite the fists of fortune punching his nose...",2015

It's got romance, drama, it's exciting, a man for the women to swoon over, beautiful English countryside, galloping horses; great costumes. It was just good and never, never boring or slow. It's got crazy English folks with bad teeth and it's just wild. I hope that it continues several years as I know I will be watching it. I've been so down and out since Downton went off in late Feb. I believe this show will definitely take the place of Downton, since it will be going off after the 6th season. Go Poldark!!",2015
8,"I prefer watching police procedural, crime TV series who could be a comedy, a romance or a thriller at times, in general. But this one works like a charm for me too. Because this is like ""Les Miserables"", my favorite novel telling the story of close historical period. Also, I should admit I like watching TV shows having good looking cast members just like Poldark. But actors performances are also deserve standing ovation. Although this is a remake of Poldark, it is the first version I have ever watched and I really like this one. I won't write a spoiler here. So, if you like watching TV series with intrigue, romance, endeavor, drama, hope and despair my advice is just watch for yourself. After watching then come here and write your review about the series too. Good entertainment!",2015
10,"Have watched the first 3 episodes. Great scenery, cinematography, acting and costumes. I love the setting in late 1700s/early 1800s England. But the best part is that the central character is thoroughly likable, even if not thoroughly plausible. Oh....and yes, he is handsome and does have an awesome, cut torso, which is besides the point. What attracts me more and more to a series is whether or not there are likable characters portrayed by great actors conveying realistic dialogue. I much prefer to watch someone likable than to watch someone unlikeable. No...I do NOT love to hate a villainous character. I would love to love a virtuous character. I am at an age, 55, where focusing on the positive in life is so much more important than focusing on the negative. I just wish Hollywood and the movie industry would catch up with me.",2015

9,"Rarely do I find a tale that so draws me in and that is because the story is elegant and gritty, actors outstanding, and scenery simply stunning! The word, ""noble"" means something and not all noblemen demonstrate it. The relationships are not predictable, nor the storyline which shows the desperation of those who scrape by--mostly with honor--and some not troubled by honor but wealth. From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life. I rate it higher than even Downton Abbey, which I have followed with dedication, as I will with Poldark. I hope it is around for a decade at least!",2015
9,"Starting off smouldering as a redcoat in the American War of Independence where he ""volunteered"" to avoid being hanged back home in Cornwall,Ross Poldark (Mr A.Turner) continues much in the same vein on his return to find his inheritance gone and his fiancée appropriated by his rather wet cousin. He is man apart from his Cornish pals due to him having gone to a posh school and everything and feels like a square peg in a round hole living in a run - down bothy with two recalcitrant servants. On a visit to town to sell his watch he saves a young girl from a beating and takes her to a tavern where she exhibits shockingly bad manners;despite this he offers her a place at his pigsty,where,in short order she turns out to be a damned attractive young lady. She is called Demelza and is played with relish by Miss E.Tomlinson. Her Pa and her brothers come to take her back but are beaten off by Ross and his homies,this gives Mr Turner further opportunities to smoulder with a bloody nose to boot. His former fiancée realises she has made a terrible mistake,but she's obviously mistaken him for someone who gives a toss and he rides off with Demelza into episode two. I really enjoyed this new ""Poldark"" because it does post - modern irony which of course hadn't been invented forty years ago when it had it's first incarnation. It is a deliberate exercise in myth - building with Poldark himself set to be the next Mr Darcy. There are dog - fights,cock - fights and bloke - fights enough for anybody and Mr Turner cuts a suitable dash to ensure the next few Sunday nights will be accompanied by a couple of cans of lager and some Pringles. So it's off the blocks and running,then,for the Beeb's next Big One. Forget the politically - motivated ""Banished"" and watch this for the sheer fun of it.",2015
9,"I created an IMDb account specifically to review this show. Having never seen the original I cannot speak to how it compares but I will say that if you are hearing (and viewing) this story for the first time, it is quite good. The acting is superb, the casting of Aiden Turner is perfect. I especially like the character Prudie. The scenery is gorgeous and the story line captivating. A definitely must see for anyone who enjoys period pieces. Not much of a history buff so I don't know how historically accurate the props are, but if you are looking for a new Sunday night regular, this is a good one. Great entertainment, I can't wait for more. Usually I do not individual TV episodes more than once but have already watched both Poldark episodes three times each. I find myself foregoing my regular programs in order to re-watch the Poldark episodes. I would like to see a bit more action in this particular series. I feel like a good throw down between Ross and Francis is not only inevitable, but I would find it welcome. I almost found myself wanting Captain Blamey to kill Francis during the duel in the middle of episodes two. I was disappointed that he didn't die but I guess it leaves it open for the future.",2015
6,"It started off so promising. Lovely camera work, nice acting, but then .... The writing and directing started falling apart rapidly. Scenes started to look very over the top, the story telling very predictable, sometimes boring and sometimes even hilarious and very inconsistent. Some scenes look as if they were part of a rather bad commercial with actors looking bewildered (or like a deer in the head lights)with agonizing violins playing in the background. It's like watching a soap, but without any sense of humour. The characters are depicted so over the top, that it resembles a Disney production for kids. The bad guy is Scrooge or Cruella all over again, almost laughable. The good guy seems to have come from Homeland and plays a bi-polar role. One scene he is a social, loving and caring husband, the next scene he is a egotistical self indulging hypocrite galloping through the series on his horse. It's not the acting. Actually it is in a weird way kind of fun how the actors play these almost ridiculous and often impossible roles. Quite good in fact. A bit like a soap or a satire. So I feel a bit cheated. I wanted it to be more a historical time piece, more subtle, more realistic, less over the top. Then again, this is probably how modern entertainment is brought to us nowadays.",2016
7,"I was a fan of the 1975+ series & of the books. I like this series well enough to look forward to each week's episode. However, compared to the Robin Ellis version I find Aiden Turner's Ross a bit heavy & morose. He doesn't laugh enough. This Ross takes himself far more seriously than Robin Ellis' Ross or the Ross of the books. That Ross was a ""good guy"" but not someone ready for the French Revolution. Demelza was a little spit fire. This Demelza is quiet & subdued. In the 1975 version one saw that Ross' humor had to fall in love with Demelza's puckish spirit & vice versa. I'm not sure why this Ross fell for this Demelza. My main issue with this version & why I gave it a 7 is that the story telling feels rushed. I almost feel like we are getting the Cliff's Notes version rather than the novels. The 1975 version was well paced and gave us time to understand who was who + what & why was things were happening. I'm still not quite sure who is who beyond Ross, Demelza, Elizabeth, Francis & Verity. I'm a costumer & the history stickler in me has to point out that this story should have started in 1782 at the latest. The costumes are erratic.... some are fine, but others belong more in the 1790s. Had I been the costume designer, I'd have gone more for costumes that were a bit old-fashioned looking for the period... ca 1760s-1770s, rather than fashion forward, because Cornwall was remote & not an extremely wealthy part of the UK (too much boom & bust). Even the gentry of the area would only have had access to the latest fashions when they went to London, which would have probably only been once a year. Women's gowns & men's coats & waistcoats would have been a little behind the times & often remade to try to make them look more currently fashionable.",2015
5,"Having loved the original, I was keen to see what forty odd years and a decent budget could do for this belting story. The scenery certainly doesn't disappoint! What does is the jerky editing as the pace needlessly speeds up, slows down, fast again... why? Do we need a slow motion for two seconds of a horse galloping? One of the major problems of the first episode is that it's overproduced, for want of a better word. The direction is obvious, obtrusive and we've seen it ten times before (and ten times better).",2015
10,"I heard many people saying that Victorian novels like ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"" are lovely and romantic. I don't agree. It's all about money and, for a change, a rich guy dating a less rich girl, both of course, from society. It's all about love letters, kisses under trees and everyone that who really works is invisible and disposable. ""Poldark"" shows a guy in love who lost almost everything. When he's about to run away, he realises that people depend on him to have food on their tables. He, then, rolls up his sleeves, go to work - ACTUAL manual work - and makes the difference. Of course, there are bankruptcy issues, death in the family and real love with a hardworking girl who couldn't even properly speak but had a huge heart. I can't wait for the next season. Right now, I'm on internet looking for his books.",2016
9,"I think this series has it all. Superb acting, great dialogue, and wonderful simple story. I particularly like the characters. You sort of get attached to the main characters. Most series I cannot get passed the first, second or third episodes and I just get fed up or bored. This series it is completely different you want to be with the characters and go through their struggles. Some characters you feel their pain and sympathize with them. The scenery of the places are stupendous. I wish I lived in a place like that. Why can't series have a simple story, strong dialogue, and good acting. In my opinion that is all you really need. Easier said then done. I hope I could see more series like this one. I am giving it a 9 because I am comparing to other similar series and this is just a remake of the original.",2016

It has great actors and costumes and the places they shoot are incredible. If you're like me who loves history and romance..you'll certainly love this show. furthermore, the characters need more development but this concerns only a few of them but nothing more everything is great. I love it. definitely worth a shot.",2017
3,"If there were nothing to compare it to, this series would be interesting, but it is less faithful to the books, less detailed than the much longer earlier series, and for those who watch British historical drams for the costumes, much less accurate in dress. It also adds gratuitous violence, such as the fight between Ross and Delmelza's father. In fact in the book and original series, all the father wanted was money, and he went away happy once Ross paid him Demelza's salary until she came of age. No fight, and no fight between the villagers either.",2015
8,"The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.",2015
3,"I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.",2015
1,"Love, as it is titled, should be called Bored Whiny Man Child. This dirge clocks in at a whopping 2 hours and 15 minutes. I had to stop, walk away for a while and then return to watch this sniffling character act out his hypocrisy in such myopic detail. The relationship between the two principal characters is like oil and water. The only thing they share is a voracious appetite for sex, lots and lots of sex. The add a third person into the mix who winds up getting pregnant by the guy which leads to the main couple breaking up. Since they all were in a ménage à trois, that shouldn't have been an issue but it was. The female leaves him and we spend the rest of the film exploring his memories of her and him having more sex. They participate in orgies and he gets mad because she's having sex with other guys. He can had fun but she can't. If your life is nothing but the sex, why should that matter especially if he can participate and she can't? And there lies the quagmire with this presentation. This guy is totally immature. You become bored with him and with him having sex. Closeups of him with his exploding orgasms weren't shocking, innovative, wanted or move the picture along. After a while, you just want this story to just wrap up. You wonder what is the point? There is nothing redeeming about it. The other female character who has had his child is completely ignored. She is just another prop instead of exploring that dynamic of how they are dealing with a child together. Instead, we find his character crying in the bathtub with the toddler. And you have to ask yourself once again, the time he and his old girlfriend were together appears to be at least three years because you have to factor in the time the girl was pregnant and then you jump in time to see a toddler at least two years old. So why did his old girlfriend/s mother call him about her and why did he just started thinking about someone who hasn't been in his life for a long time? The writing was just poor. This guy was suppose to be some aspiring filmmaker. He is neither aspiring or making films and filming your naked girlfriend on a small video camera doesn't qualify you one bit. That aspect of the character was totally ignored as well. This was just bad. If you want to see if because of the unsimulated sex scenes, I would advise just watch some 5 minute porn clip and avoid this colossus time waster.",2016

8,"'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. ",2015
1,"There's a point when the main character and voice-over narrator on Love says that he never sees a movie presenting ""emotional sexuality"". Sex, semen and blood, that's what people would like to see. Murphy is a filmmaker, or so he says. Actually, I think he is just a puppet to Gaspar Noé intents in this too stereotyped film that had the big ambition to be innovative.",2015
1,"I normally don't write reviews. I only write in case a movie is too good or it is too bad. In this case its way below the worst movie I have ever seen. Honestly I have never seen a movie so bad. There is no story, no plot, acting is horrible and once the movie starts you will pray that the movie ends. Not even a single scene makes sense. To be honest, its just porn tried to be passed off as a movie. I m not sure how this movie even got a recognition. It starts off with a sex scene. I wont call it a sex scene, it starts with porn. The whole movie you will not know what its about or where it is going and in the end you will curse yourself why did u waste 2 hours of your life watching it. People who are misled by hearing that the movie has got good love scenes, I urge them to watch porn but don't watch this.",2016

1,"I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDb description says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong with Electra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The movie should have been called ""Borderline Personality Disorder"". The writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an (expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for his mindless violence - ""I'm an American an we fight for what's ours blah blah"" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him - what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded pillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abomination deserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sex scenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this would be a career ender for all involved.",2016

On the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in south America).",2015

The editing is horrific, every single shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality, there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well, these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy giving people seizures with random flashing lights.",2015

The first hit draws them in, and as they chase the dragon with each other, trying to make each hit as momentous as the last, their relationship evolves, blossoms, and suffers. ",2015

I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and ""artsy."" It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother.",2016

So, I and many others waited for at least an hour to watch this last showing at the festival. The movie starts off with a bang - two people pleasuring each other! And intermixed with the pleasuring there's arguing and lots of it. This movie is sex scene after sex scene with a little bit of plot in between. This film was also in 3D, so the ""moneyshot"" was a bit too real. The characters are somewhat interesting, but the motive behind the relationships are very fragile. And I am not quite sure about the end. It is rather ambiguous. For the longest time, you have no idea how anyone is affording to live in Paris and what they do besides have lots and lots of sex. After a while, it's not even sexy sex. And, to my surprise, plenty of people walked out of the film well before it ended. I am glad I saw it. It was an experience, but ""Porn""...I mean ""Love"" wasn't exactly a good movie. Also, I can't see this film playing in American theaters. Even with strong editing, it'd be extremely graphic.",2015
1,"I often joke with friends about the fact that if you film it, it's not prostitution, and this film is exactly that. I guess it is creative, but boy, a money shot within the first moments of a ""film""? We Americans are often considered prudish vs our European counterparts, but this film has more in common with porn than with an art film. How much does an actress get paid to swallow on camera? ",2016
7,"Well the movie is really different, i felt sad for the main male character with his behavior, the sex scenes are really strong but not from another world, I was not horny, in any sex scene, i just see trying to understand the director point of view, and i hope i did understand this...natural,humans,sex,internet,porn,bisexual and a lot of other things that is happening and will happen in the future, i liked the movie and I did not like, i am giving 7 because the director did a really great job to express the reality of the movie love,behavior,choices and sex.

9,"I really enjoy this series, i truly do ! Why ? Not because i want in-depth scripts and complex personalities and such but genuine laid-back real-life drama. A TV series that you can get into from the first episode and by the end you know what's up. No need to watch the first 5 episodes before it all starts making sense. It's realistic and therefore it appeals to a lot of people even though most people haven't lived that sort of life or know celebrities for that matter. We know enough through the tabloids, TV, news, internet, etc etc. to know how some people can't carry the weight of success and they end up on the wrong side of history. We've seen many examples and of course we have also seen people that handle it pretty well too.",2015
8,"This is a show that deserves at least a 7.5 - 8.0. There's no show out there like it really right now. The actors are good, im not just talking about Dwayne Johnson but everyone else. They just go good with this show & what its about.",2015
10,"This is show is a fast-paced romp that clearly draws from it's Entourage roots both in styling and format. While it may not be ground-breaking TV it is extremely enjoyable with Dwayne Johnson being a superb choice for the lead. The supporting cast is also well chosen with strong performances by John David Washington, Omar Benson Miller and Donovan W. Carter II. Really, the show is very well cast all around. While it will be interesting to see how all the characters evolve, I'm particularly curious to see how Dwayne's character develops and understand what motivates his financial choices. For the complainers, lets try and remember this is entertainment, not nuclear fission. I personally look forward to watching this show evolve and mature over time.",2015
5,Doesn't work for me.,2015
5,"Ballers started off great with some interesting conflicts that you couldn't wait to see how they turned out. In the end, all the conflicts were solved to easily and made it feel like a real let down. For example, when the Vernon Littlefield blackmail situation came up in the show, what would have made it interesting was if Vernon's best friend was behind it. In the end it was Spencer Strasmore's ex and all he had to do was talk to her to resolve it...... really. The created lots of interesting story-lines only to just disappoint in the end. The Rock was great though, Rob Corddry did a good job, he was funny. Troy Garity and Dulé Hill also did a good job and fit their roles well. ",2015
8,"I honestly think this is a good show. I know it's on HBO and shows like True Detective and Game of Thrones have writing, directing and acting that are all on point and set at such a high level. So everyone expects almost perfection from an HBO show. Let me just say that this show is a good show and better than most shows on the air right now. It's not quite on the level of production as the best HBO shows. But I would say it's a higher quality show than Entourage, which was also an HBO show.",2015
5,"Ballers is a view into the fantasy land of being an NFL player, but not everything is champagne and caviar in the mean and nasty pro sports landscape. The show is flat for me because a) the Rock is not believable as a financial adviser. Did he go into this line of work just because his name is Spencer Strasmore, and it sounds like a 200 year old blue blood investment bank? b) the guys on this show, no matter if they throw in some adversity, always get what they want in the end. Like Entourage.. Oh, a magic phone call came in from Dallas, they want to offer you asking price plus $10M. all is fine in the world again! oh you had unprotected sex with that random club girl? your STD test came back negative! no worries! c.) the actors don't seem to care that much. Rob Cordroy is OK, the boss is half decent, but the Jewish/Italian agent looks at the camera half the time, the Rock is playing himself yet again, and the famous guys they get on the show are always brutal.",2016
7,"Almost finished watching the series. I would say it is somewhat entertaining for sure, but don't expect a great series. Actually i feel disappointed, because to be honest, i really think that this show (or the idea of it) had potential. It lacks substance, we need more stories - it should have had that ""Any Given Sunday"" vibe and if they wanted some comedy a bit of ""Jerry Maguire"" also. Make an episode at least 45 min - 25 min for this kind of show will just present some shallow stories, with no real substance. It's really a shame, i actually enjoyed The Rock in the show and if they would've made the series seriously, it would've a lot of room to grow.",2015
4,"This strong ensemble cast suffers from a whitewashed plot line. I can only assume the producers are wary of offending the NFL, but it's like they cut away right when something crazy should happen. ",2016
8,"I was fairly neutral going into ""Ballers,"" but the idea of seeing fast cars, flashy lifestyles, and of course, the Rock intrigued me. However halfway into the pilot, a few things became painfully obvious. The writing is passable. It is by no means bad, but being an HBO show, I expected sharp writing akin to ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Girls,"" or ""Silicon Valley."" Nevertheless the dialogue wasn't bad, it was just... not what I would have liked. Possibly sharper humor and more insights into the financial world of the rich. Even better would be a new take on professional sports that we haven't seen already. The acting is good though. The Rock is charismatic as ever, and the supporting cast hold their roles well. The only thing is seeing Dule Hill go from playing the hilariously nonathletic and effeminate Gus from ""Psych"" to a player for the Miami Dolphins. That was a bit jarring. Either way it's nice to see him in another role. The most troubling thing is really the pacing. As soon as the show starts, we are thrown into the opening credits which move dizzyingly fast and leave your head spinning. From there the show makes a breakneck pace in its story progression. I really wish they would've taken their time and made it an hour long show instead of a half hour. It would have given them time to flesh out character development and let scenes play out naturally. In its current state it feels like someone is standing behind the actors with a cattle prod telling them to hurry up. Just like the writing itself, the pacing could learn lessons from ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Girls,"" each of whom takes its time in the delivery of the narrative. Let the characters really be characters. Advancing the plot doesn't have to happen every few seconds. To be fair it is only the first episode. Maybe they were going quickly to make the first episode a big one, and things will slow down and progress more naturally in later episodes. We will see next week.",2015
5,"This is an HBO show on its second season. The show premise is about a retired and injured football player who decides to be an agent and help other players, in a sense, so they do not end up like he did. There is one thing about TV shows like these that try too hard to authenticate their story. It's when real- life people are hired to perform jobs they are not qualified to do such as acting. Each time a real-life footballer or coach shares the screen with someone like Andy Garcia, you can tell immediately the error of the producers or casting people. It is a huge mistake to put people on a show just because they are the real deal unless they can act. Watching this show can be painful especially for people that do not know about football players but like to watch a fun show. It made me cringe so bad today that I wanted to warn other viewers. I was watching S02-E03 today, and it was the big guy who hurt his Achilles heel that made me stop the show.",2016

It's injected with some great dry humor, realistic sets and locations, sharp colorful photography, great scripts, and I must say top class and very fluid acting. It seems the actors are actually having some fun with their roles and have been given an element of freedom to develop their characters. I'd like to think Ballers is a realistic insight into the world of American Football but to be honest I don't know, and I'm not sure I even care. What matters is Ballers works for me, is believable and in a nutshell makes for great entertainment and is a pleasure to watch each week!",2016
3,"This show is about basketball (at least that's what I understood, even though I didn't hear any reference to the sport on the first 20 something minutes). Let me correct myself, this show is about watching ""the Rock"" doing some retired player in a re-writing of Entourage. Why do you keep doing this kind of series? You had a decent one like Entourage, you should stop! The cast is amazing, good actors, not so good actors (talking about Jazmyn Simon, among others - don't you think you look better in comedy movies?) and they all look very attained to make this a good series. Except that this isn't. Poor script, poor organization of scenes and mostly, lack of originality. For those reasons, I really hope this ends soon and stop waisting TV time.",2015

There are many flaws but overall a good enough show!",2017
6,"I was excited to see the latest offering from Steven Levinson, with input from Mark Wahlberg.The success of Entourage and the character arcs were interesting, and each episode felt complete, almost like mini-movies. So why not apply this winning formula to the Football world? Well it seems they tried and in my opinion, failed. Standing by itself it's an OK show at best, but I feel cheated after the end of Season 2. It's almost as if 2 seasons have passed and NOTHING has been resolved, or happened. Spencer's arc is boring and feels like it's going nowhere. I don't see any other arcs going anywhere and the season ended on a dull 'nothing' note.",2016

Primarily based in a world of 'tit's & ass (and who doesn't love that?!),' it's a wonderful 'no brainer' show with some interesting subplots...second of course to the T&A and general over-indulgence. Great performances from Dwayne Johnson and a number of the supporting cast, however prepare yourself the likes of Donavon Carter (Vernon) and others who'll make your question if the Casting Director has a substance abuse issue..",2017

6,"With a relatively good rating, and good reviews I thought the show was going to better than it actually was. The show's comedy is very one dimensional and somewhat stereotypical, it's similar to what you will find in the movies 'war dogs', 21/22 jump street, superbad, etc. So don't expect any comedic gold to come out of this show, for me it was a giggle every now and then. As far as the story goes, it's once again pretty plain, you can see what's going to happen next from a mile away and you always know that everything is going to go okay for our protagonists. The show was underwhelming to say the least, but it was still an in all entertaining, if you're looking for a show that isn't serious and might make you crack a smile here and there, go ahead and watch it, the episodes are short so you won't get bored, I wouldn't call it a bad show, but it's not as good as it could be either.",2017

Second thing, the whole idea of bringing in new NATS was just poor reason to not develop story with just old NATS and required more characters to build up a complex plot(!??!) and add lot of curiosity in the story. This series requires some series good writers. The writing is very linear and episodes are insanely boring to watch. Most of the training scenes are purely fillers and has less significance for the story. That just means to me to kill time you show the training required.

Real life, he would have never made it to that point, range master would have jerked this guy off the line, sent home never to return. Then you have everyone turning in all of their firearms, but one cadet. He decides to keep his firearm and not take the red one he is supposed to carry. So we are to believe the range master never notices ONE red firearm that was never picked up. Are you kidding me. Then this guy takes a loaded firearm into the interview room, kills one person, and eventually kills himself, really???. In real life, a complete background and polygraph is done way before the agency wastes a dime on these applicants. His ""secret"" would have been found out very early because they ask you one very important question, ""have you ever knowingly committed a felony?"" .

The FBI researches you, but you are dead worried about a rookie finding out your secret that you completely flip.

Third, there are too many characters - most of them rather poorly developed.

The purpose of the story has devolved to stating how racist and hated all republicans are. There is nothing redeeming as all the women are presented as the superior to men intellectually and morally. Funny since the characters have no morals and are all rather stupid. The young guns are to save the country from the evil conservatives who are all racist and fascists. This show has no redeeming value and has been removed from my record list. If I could, I'd give it a 0.",2017

10,"At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film ""ROOM"" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. ",2015
10,"""Room"" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.",2016

The addition of ""insignificant"" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.",2016
10,"Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur.

Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.",2015

10,"I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')",2015

9,"Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? ",2016
10,"Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round.

2,"This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of ""Life is Beautiful"" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch.",2015

9,"Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.",2016

While he may not quite get past the whole ""kid actor"" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.",2015

Sure enough, Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually pretty cool.

9,"AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable, all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast film.",2015
8,"Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.",2015

8,"For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.",2015
10,This movie is incredible. A ton of fun with brilliant action and hilarious dialogue this is another fantastic win for Marvel. Paul Rudd plays a likable and charismatic hero who really makes you root for him and his goals. Michael Pena is the real heist of this film as he steals every scene that he is in. Corey Stoll as the villain was a fantastic choice from Marvel. He can play the corporate business man and an intimidating villain. The visuals are stunning in this film. All of the tiny ant scenes are visually outstanding and hilarious. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. Ant Man is a fantastic movie which is worth your money and I suggest that you see it in cinemas.,2015
8,"OK, so I will probably target the wrath of a legion of fan-boys but as a PhD Physicist I will categorically state that much of the science in the Marvel universe is total nonsense. For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it's called ""Science Fiction"" for a reason, right?

The cast gave great performances from top to bottom keeping the viewer engaged. Paul Rudd is another great choice as lead from the Marvel casting department. Michael Douglas gives a signature performance as Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly is another kick-ass female character in the MCU. Oh yeah, Michael Pena stills the show with his comedic timing. The action in this movie is like nothing you've ever seen. And the comedy was on point throughout. The heart of the movie is it's focus on a father's love for his daughter, and what he'd do to show that love and protect her. All in all an amazing release from the House of Mouse.",2015

Once the film was finished, I actually walked out of the theater somewhat happy knowing that I used a free ticket that I got through my theater's rewards program to go see it. Otherwise, I would've regretted even spending money on it.

The dynamics are present in every family household from illness, to the struggle that wealth brings, to homosexuality to obesity and style. The music is amazing.

She is an OG gangsta female who is unafraid to speak her mind and is always in the Height of Fashion. Besides that the chemistry that still exists between her and Luscious is palpable.

When you think about the wit, creativity, artistry, hard work and brain power that goes into the business of Hip Hop, this show is a slap in the face. The characters are uninspired, poorly written, predictable and hackneyed. I expected far more. This was a MAJOR let down.",2015
9,"First  I don't typically like rap and hip hop but I LOVED THIS. I am only not giving this a 10 because it's the first episode but OH HOT DANG it's great. There is not one bad actor or tress. Let's start out with saying GABOUREY SIDIBE HAS NOT DONE ONE BAD ROLE. She is a phenomenon. I will keep this short and spoiler free and say that it has something for EVERYONE. I can understand why people wouldn't like it but keep and open mind. It has good music (which you don't have to be a hip hop fan to like because, I liked it A LOT) Good acting which is always good. Great plot And basically great everything. I can't recommend this enough.",2015
1,"I have to say this is one of the worst shows I've watched. A friend told me about this and i said ""Oh that's sound's like an interesting show"", but no it's really horrible. I have to say the music sounded like something you would hear on Disney Channel. The one scene that killed me the most is when Jamal was performing in the club/bar, I mean come on really it was auto-tuned??? I don't expect this to last very long. Oh my gosh and Luscious's reaction to his son's song, like really I thought his song was terrible. Sorry for my bad punctuation in this review, but I'm sure it will get a better rating than this show because I'm giving it a 1 star.",2015

1,"Seriously, drugs, hoods, criminals, murderers, psychologically sick people who just happen to be 'black'--this is precisely how Fox TV would have America and the world view the African American people, to perpetuate the stereotype they are so anxious to create. My family and friends will not support this garbage---Is it so impossible to present a positive image like the Cosby Show--why couldn't these talented actors be in a show with a positive image? Maybe there actually is a conspiracy to bring down Bill Cosby (a positive image) after all, I'm about to be convinced...okay after he's down, what are they going to make up about Denzel? I mean really, this is the only thing 'they' can project to the world (our kids) about us...this is so old and tired, these producers should be fired for extreme lack of creativity---this crap was shown 50 years ago...dump it!!! It provides absolutely NO value, only to the lowest denominator in the hood community!!! DON'T WATCH!!!",2015
1,"This show jerks from one ridiculous scene to another in a manner reminiscent of one of those truly awful Latin-American telenovelas. There is a slight difference here in that whilst those are entertainment for the sake of it, this show appears to have an 'agenda'.",2015
2,"I had been looking forward to watching this show ever since I looked it up after seeing a Billboard of it on my drive home from work a couple of weeks ago. The way it was billed and set up had me thinking that the next great drama on television would be on broadcast TV for once instead of cable or Netflix like Breaking Bad and House of Cards. I talked my wife into sitting down and watching it with me by telling her I thought it would be a great plot and that everybody was saying the acting would be superb. My wife could only make it through about 15 minutes before she had enough of it, my pride made me sit through the first 30 minutes before calling it quits. The music was probably the best part of the show but that isn't saying much, they were too drawn out and not ingrained in the show. It was almost like hey we are going to pause the show and play a song for the next three minutes. The acting was HORRIBLE, for this I blame the director because I know some of these characters can act. The made every scene way to overly dramatic and would have some some cheesy background music to try and make it even more dramatic. EPIC FAIL",2015
10,"#TeamCookie This show is definitely captivating. The drama, the music, the actors/actresses just all make for one heck of a show. It touches on so many issues we deal with in today's society and brings them to the forefront: Bi-polar disorder, ALS, sexuality, dysfunctional families, following your dreams, standing up for yourself/confidence, being able to move beyond your circumstances and so many other things. I am especially happy to see these things being touched on so that it can open the dialog to deal with these issues, especially in the Black community. Taraji's character illustrates a mother's love and how she will do anything even sacrifice her freedom to ensure her family will escape the perils of poverty and life in the slums. Terrance's character shows how money can change you and when you loose yourself in the process you also loose so much more. A man that choose his dream over love and now regrets it while living in two worlds his old and his new. I could on but I urge you to tune in and see it for yourself. It's a new spin on a classic life story.",2015
1,"Someone told me about the show, I came to IMDb to check the ratings. 7,1 should be a good quality show. The theme interests me, the music/producing stuff, not the I have one year to live stuff, so I prepared to watch and enjoy good TV.",2015
5,"I had so much anticipation for this show, loved the topic and assumed that with the caliber of actors cast it would be awesome. Instead, the writing is so awful that there are almost no characters...just caricatures of (I'm guessing) what white writers think black people are like. If I was black I would be offended. Since I am white I am instead embarrassed to the point of cringing. I can think of no excuse for the shallow, stereotype-ridden scripting of this show. ",2015
5,"In reading some of the comments, was shocked at how many of you wanted to just ""race bash""!!! I am not black, but was really looking forward to this show For me it didn't matter what color or race the actors are, just that they are talented! But the GAY thing could have been left out. I think Taraji P. Henson is an great actress, very versatile, she and Terance play good off one another. The story is good, but the part that turned me off was when Jamal was kissing his male, gay boyfriend!!! Why in the world did the writers have to mess this show up by throwing in that JUNK!!! Even in the 'story line' Terance & others are telling Jamal and the mother Taraji- that the gay crap just won't fly, especially with the black people. I'm not black, but it doesn't doesn't fly with me either. There are already far too many shows with gay people, how about writing more for the straight folks??!!! Hope that IF this show continues that Jamal is written out IF he is to play a gay guy. He may be musically talented, but let, or allow us to just listen to and enjoy his talent musically, rather than making out with another man! YUK!!!!",2015
3,"Anything with Howard, Henson, and Yoba in it has some potential, enough for me to round up from 2 to 3 stars out of 10. But this is really just a lame soap opera about black music industry stereotypes. The characters fall into one of two categories, malevolent and annoying or just annoying. A lot of the rest of the cast look like they belong on a soap opera, that is, they could be models and they do more posing than talking. Hard to like anyone enough to watch them, though. Anytime someone gets killed off or diagnosed with some terminal disease you may feel a little guilty, but you can be pretty sure TV land is a happier place without them.",2015
2,"I have never written a review before ever, which I'm sure you will notice by my awful writing style, but I really had to ask, what is all the fuss with this show, Empire? Its absolutely awful. Even the acting is so over the top. ",2015

10,"Some background. I came to the states without any knowledge of engish and neither did my parents. It was some midwestern state in the early 1990s. In the school, there were 3 asians, and 1 black kid. From the very first episode to episode 8. I felt like my life was shown. I had the same infatuation with hiphop. My first album was Straight Outta Compton. PE and Ice Cube and Ice T were my favorite groups. I felt exactly as the series describe, it's not that the white folks were disrespectful to me (in fact there where at the beginning), but they just don't know what to do with a person of different race and culture. I could never truly be in the ""in crowd"". I found commonality in people who are different and music that's different, and most hiphop at that time was portraying rebellion against the establishment. To me, the establishment was white with Christian morales. That's not what I am about. I had 3 Asian kids in school who are straight A and musicians. I ain't about that nonsense. All through school, my best friend was a black kid and he was the one that introduced me to straight outta compton.",2015

It highlights some of the common issues of assimilation without exploiting or demeaning the Asian American experience. Eddie Huang's story, brought to life by the brilliant Nahnatchka Khan, is a refreshingly delightful addition to the spark of new diversity in Hollywood that hopefully will burn brighter and brighter throughout the entertainment industry. The story is fun, engaging and smart. The relationship are honest, multi-layered and full of heart. The performances are superb. I see many awards in the future, especially for Hudson Yang, Randall Park and Constance Wu.",2015

10,I don't watch a lot of television series due to my need to like a TV show from the first episode (a problem I feel many people have)... maybe it has something to do with my profession as a Cardiothoracic surgeon and me having not much time for a build up of slow starting sitcom.,2015
10,"I came into Fresh Off the Boat with low expectations, as there are seemingly endless ways to make a bad network show, especially by making it dull and mediocre by dumbing down the characters and their experiences. Add in the topic of race and immigration, where I'm certain network producers are terrified of offending anyone, and you're almost certain to brew up a giant batch of watered-down, ""family friendly"" weak tea.",2015
10,"OMG This was the most hilarious show ever. So many of the concepts are so true ha ha. This is a must see show, no matter what race, or culture your from. I love it. If i were to have an Asian American TV show this would be it. The cast is hilarious, and is on par with black-ish. Not to mention this is based on a real life autobiography just like the Goldbergs TV show. I really look forward to the upcoming episodes and hope they can keep the quality of the episodes the same and keep jokes coming, because adding this to my repertoire of TV shows i think this is a real step towards the the Asian American culture being on TV, i hope that everyone gives this show a chance, as i did. Because i think you will love this show",2015
9,"""Fresh Off the Boat"" is a show about a Taiwanese-American family who has moved from Washington, DC (where there are lots of Taiwanese- Americans) to Orlando, Florida (where there are none!). While this sounds a bit like ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" or the like, the show still is surprisingly original and worth seeing. There are several things I really appreciate about it: it DOES talk about race and stereotypes (something very rare on TV today) and writing is so good. The characters, as a result, are very likable. Overall, there's very little not to like about this one and I see it as actually being a lot like the wonderful show, ""Brooklyn Bridge""--but with a greater emphasis on humor. Well worth seeing--whether you are Asian or not.",2015
10,"As the title says, not since Malcolm in the Middle have I seen such a hilarious family dynamic. Yes, the family is Chinese (Taiwanese) but this is just a side-story...they could be Polish (like in Malcolm in the Middle) or any other ethnicity making them unique. This is NOT about Asian stereotypes, this is about kids vs parents who are trying to keep up appearances/with the Jones'...and what could be more American than that? Superb acting by ALL the actors (even the Grandmother who only speaks Mandarin gets the funniest lines with subtitles). Add to this the nostalgia factor of the ""hip-hop"" 90's and I sincerely hope this is a formula for success. PLEASE keep this show on the air; it's got humor, good timing, good writing and it's something the whole family can watch and laugh at together. We are laughing WITH a family that happens to be Chinese, not AT a Chinese family.",2015
9,"Living in today's world we see more and more Asian people all in our communities I like living around them too, they are intelligent attractive and mostly friendly. This new ABC series set in 1990's Orlando about a Taiwanses family who moved from Washington D.C. to start a new life is a big winner! It centers around the young man and oldest child in the family named Eddie Huang(Hudson Yang)who is learning more and more American culture in the 90's from the style, music, TV, movies and one liners as this series captures the 90's culture well with it's slang and one liners! A real sugar and spice treat is the performance of the mom Jessica(Constance Wu)she's a sexy and sassy outspoken loving matriarch who guides the ship for the whole Huang clan as her husband(Randall Park)runs his steakhouse. Overall great show that learns us about Asian culture all the while being funny, educated and capturing 90's culture without taking things to serious! A thumbs up winner.",2015
10,"I would first like to say that after watching the first two episodes, this show is fantastic. Not only because it is paving the way for more diversity in the industry, but also because it is a hilarious and charming show. I found myself laughing out loud a various points throughout the episodes and throughly enjoyed getting to know these characters. Regarding to the reviews consisting of complaints about the show's racism toward white people (groan), these viewers are missing the point of the show. This show is portraying what is was like, and still is like for that matter, for Asian families being the minority and the racism THEY face. Yes, the show takes some jabs at Caucasians, but that's hardly racism. It is actually impossible to be racist toward white people, as racism only applies when institutional power or privilege is involved. Since White people have the most privilege in this country, it's impossible to be racist against a white person, or rather nearly impossible. Yes, you can be prejudice toward white, people, but this show is definitely not prejudice. So please don;t write this show off because it's ""being racist toward white people."" I would like to end this review by saying that I am thoroughly pleased that there is finally a show with multiple Asian actors as its main characters. Although one day, I hope there can be shows not specifically about AN Asian American FAMILY, but rather a family that just happens to be Asian. Because yes, there's a difference. Race aside, this show is a refreshing comedy and is definitely unique. It should appeal to all audiences, as long as they keep an open mind. I would be very sad if this show were to get canceled.",2015
9,"I'm glad that we can see a TV drama starring all Asian actors in American mainstream media. As one of the most contrary culture to Western, it could be knotty to handle this complex subject.

9,"If you're not Chinese and was wondering how accurately this TV show portrays Chinese Americans I am happy to tell you that many of the themes that ""Fresh of the Boat"" (hereon ""FOB"") deals with is very accurately Chinese (I was born in Taiwan and raised in the U.S. just like Eddie Huang, who wrote the book that this entire series is based on.)",2015
9,"First I have to say i love the show. But after reading the reviews i have to add this show isn't that innovative so don't expect something you haven't seen before. The concept with the narrator voice from the future has been done, and not just with white families, no even with black ones. ""Fresh Off The Boat"" is more or less ""Everybody hates Chris"" with a Asian family. But because i liked ""Everybody Hates Chris"" i gave this one a chance and wasn't disappointed. Okay sometimes i ask myself how racist and uneducated white people in America have to be or better how ignorant of other cultures (even though they don't have one on their own other then consumerism).... but then again its America the land of the free, where everyone can be what he wants, or at least they make em think that.",2015
1,"Just watched an episode of this show (wanted to see George Takei) and I see I haven't missed anything. The acting is wooden, the jokes are not anywhere near funny, it's just a mess of a show.

10,"Wow, a feel good family show that has substance behind it. The trials and joy of an Asian American family has finally made it to the mainstream media. I was pleasantly surprised how the show strikes a good balance of humor and a piece on the cultural evolution in contemporary America. The show is centered around the Asian American experience; however people of any background can appreciate and enjoy the dynamics of a middle class family settling into a new life. Randall Park brings a terrific lightheartedness to the show with his matter-of-fact humor, while Constance Wu grounds the show with her excellent portrayal of a classic high expectation mother. I can't wait to see how the show evolves. Well done and keep up the good work.",2015
10,"Fresh Off The Boat is a great TV show that is definitely worth watching on Tuesdays, on A.B.C. Nowadays, a T.V. show seems lucky if it can get passed 1 Season. TV shows that aired a couple of years ago: Trophy Wife and Back In The Game were good, but did not get passed Season 1. This show started earlier this year, and has made it to a second season. I also feel like this show is more worth watching than other TV shows on A.B.C. I also watch Modern Family, The Middle, and The Goldbergs. I feel like this T.V. show is more funny, and more original than those other shows.",2015

10,"I rated 10/10 because , Finally there's a Asian American Comedy show on Air since 20 yrs ago. Fresh off the boat, a very outstanding TV series, I believe it's one of the best TV shows out there because, Fresh of the boat actors/actress are trying to show and demonstrate (Eddie Huangs) Chinese/Taiwanese culture lifestyle to other cultures who watches the show. Jessica Huang ( Constance Wu) (Eddie Huangs) mother, shows loving and passion to her family. Jessica Huang is also a very strict mother as she puts pressure on to her children's ( Just like most Asians parents will do) because she wants her children's to study hard, and also to not forget where they came from. Evan and Emery always compete each other ""to be the best"", to make their mother proud. Fresh of the boat represents how their culture is very important to them in this society. Finally in this generation there's an Asian comedy on TV that can finally represents Asian culture. It has been so long since there was an Asian TV show on American TV. Hopefully A TV show Like this will put more Asian characters, TV show On air.",2015
1,"Every single plot is based on racial stereotype. While it is entertaining for some white people, Asian Americans might find it somewhat insulting. When would you learn most Asians don't work in a restaurant? Taiwanese/Chinese/Korean are not the same people! This show is farked up in so many ways....",2017
8,"I guess the greatest thing that can be said about ""Fresh Off the Boat"" is that it reminds one of better times long gone - in this case, the mid-1990s (1995). I turned 10 that year; so while ""Fresh Off the Boat"" is steeped in nostalgia, it doesn't weep for those days - that's what will most likely happen to the viewer, like this viewer.",2015
6,"I was pretty excited to hear about a Asian show since there aren't any programs on TV with an Asian cast as the leads. I think it is pretty cool to promote diversity and ABC taking the risk by allowing Asians to finally have their own show plus Asian comedic characters these days are pretty one dimensional and lack the deep personality (compared to non Asian comedic characters). That being said, when I watched Fresh Off the Boat this week, the characters I feel seem too simple, shallow, and once again you have one dimensional characters with not much of a likable personality. I guess I'm too much of a realist but we have seen these stereotypical characters before on other shows and mainstream movies. The story being centered around the little kid who is portly and acts like a wannabe gangster rapper, the mother who is stereotyped like a Tiger mom, the father sounding obsessed trying to please white people with his business and the non Asians coming across as being rather racists etc etc are all about something to do race and they're all negative for some reason. The title itself is pretty offensive and I can't believe they went with that title (and yes I know it's based on the real life of celebrity chef Eddie Huang's book). I think also too that this show seems to be only a hit to be made fun of because they're Asian like William Hung. Such a shame, I was really hoping for a positive, inspiring show with interesting characters but the negative stereotypical humor and characters just seems really distracting and not really all that funny. And you know, the mother's stereotypical Asian accent gets to be bothersome after a while.",2015
7,"I feel that some people find Fresh Off the Boat humorous due to the stereotypes. The mother with her heavy Asian accent sort of reminds me of a Mad TV or Saturday Night Live sketch. She sounds fake and over does it while her husband seems to have very little accent which I find kind of odd. The two younger brothers reminds me of Rod and Todd on the Simpsons with their innocent, brainiac personality while the older brother Eddie wants to be more rebellious sort of like Bart. The grandmother seems to be the stereotypical quiet Asian grandma with unpredictable humor. Overall, I think all the actors are fine except for the mother because of her heavy, fake, Asian accent which I find very annoying and kind of kills the show. Fresh off the Boat could've been a total success if they didn't have to talk about racial issues all the time. A lot of people aren't really comfortable with that. I read someones review that they actually toned it down from the original source material. I think because of the stereotypes, Fresh off the Boat seems unnecessarily provocative and the humor rather bland. This isn't that bad, it could've been better though.",2015

The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie.

Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another depressing character that I couldn't care less about.

This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the ""fantasy"" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead.",2015

1,"There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an ""imaginary boyfriend"" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to ""UP"" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.",2015

1,"I simply cannot comprehend why this movie is being heralded as Pixar's finest. It is flawed in so many ways, which is uncharacteristic of Pixar. The concept is wholly unoriginal, which lead me to believe that Pixar would present us with something astounding to compensate, but what they have given us is unimaginative human characters whose personified emotions represent exhausted stereotypes. When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.",2015
1,"I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were ""babyish"". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.",2015
1,"what a complete waste of time - read all the wonderful reviews that are misleading, obviously these are the people that go to Disneyland about 20 times a year - incredibly slow paced, especially after ""JOY"" & ""SADNESS"" get sucked into another dimension where they befriend Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom & Dad)",2015
1,"OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.",2015
1,"Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it was pretty awful. The beginning before the movie started made me already feel that it would not be good. I can see why some people like it but I think there should have been a better storyline.",2015
1,"I don't have a lot of reasons to give. All I can say is that every other Pixar movie I have rated a 10. I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here. I want to caution someone like me to save their money so please read the other reviews with a 1 star rating. Maybe that will help guide you to a different movie to watch.",2015
1,"There is a problem with psychological reality with this movie. The fact that it is presented as entertainment for children is an extreme negative. One of the most important thrusts of human evolution has been to free humans from the former mental encumbrances of past centuries. In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of entities, the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal. I am concerned as to the sanity of the person(s) who wrote this script. Such a movie disserves the bonfire. I am amazed that our Psychologists are not protesting the showing of this movie which demonstrates only the origins of western psychology - the cocaine importer and addict Sigmund Freud.",2015
1,"Yes, my mind is blown away by this movie not because it's spectacular  as it was hailed by many critics but because this movie is super lame  for a studio that has never released a bad movie (edit: i have  forgotten about brave and cars 2 i guess pixar has lost their touch and  that's why they made finding dory)  CGI wise this movie has an outstanding work like usual but the real  problem is the story. The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for  the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was  actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i  just felt nothing and said ""is that it? what the heck?"".   The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably  because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid.  The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the  imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying  and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable.  I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this  is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to  write my first review for this abomination of an animation.  I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i  feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10.  For those who thinks this is a hate/bandwagon/troll attempt. no this is  solely what i feel about this movie and it's a shame that people are so  against bad reviews.  TL;DR: this movie lacks a fun.",2015
1,"I'm like various reviewers who consider themselves Pixar fans. In fact, I'm an animated film fan and try to see the award winners whenever I can. The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. ""Joy"" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout ""shut up and go away!"" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears. Leaving before the ending was actually with a feeling of relief at having escaped.",2015

1,"What is wrong with reviewers these days? Good movies get bad reviews and bad ones get good reviews. This movie belonged to the later category. No where near the all-round quality of a movie with a 8+ rating. Are the makers of the movie hiring third world reviewers to inflate the movie's rating? I think so. Numerous people hated this movie just as I did, but the movie's rating suggests otherwise. There were cute parts in the movie but was annoying and meanders along for the majority of it. No wow factor here. It's just another Hollywood Ponzi scheme.",2015
10,"I had no expectations for iZombie, but I've already watched the pilot three times. The story was good, the cast was great, and Rose McIver was stellar! My wife likened her to Buffy. I replied that she was kind of a zombie version of The Listener (another great show, btw), and a funny one at that! Malcolm Goodwin and Rahul Kohli were also instantly likable. Their characters each held up his end extremely well against the riveting presence of McIver/Moore And what a great idea to have Liv gain her insights by eating the brains of the deceased - her instant command of Romanian was hilarious. I look forward to seeing what other quirks the writers come up with for her.",2015
9,"Here's an alert to some of the reviewers, who seem to view this as a traditional TV drama - It's Not. A living dead zombie who assists the police in finding bad guys after eating the brains of victims is inherently ridiculous and, consequently, tongue in cheek (or perhaps in brain). Somehow, though, the show seems to pull off a balancing act between farcical situations and scenes with real emotion and drama. ",2015

9,"I've only watched the pilot and I am LOVING this show. We've been needing a quirky kick-ass heroine for some time now (with Buffy and Veronica Mars no longer on air), and Liv is here to take up the mantle.",2015
8,"I really liked this first episode and the way they put it all together the why and the how she ends up working with the police and how she deals with being a zombie was done nicely. It has a kinda ""6 feet under kinda feel but a little more light hearted. Also the situation is not gonna be real life so sometimes the situation is a little unbelievable, like cops aren't always gonna act the way real cops would exactly and people aren't gonna always freak at the concept of someone being a zombie etc. The humor was good too, actually caught myself in an unexpected chuckle. You know the kind that takes like a half second to hit you. very good almost gave it 9 stars but I like to save 9 and 10 for stuff I;m totally thrilled with. Acting was good the characters are likable. This could be one that moves up to the 9 or 10 start level after a few episodes",2015
9,"I want to start off this review by letting you guys know that you can watch episode 6-10 of iZombie FOR FREE on the CW website (Yes, you do have to turn ad-block off).",2015
10,"As a zombie and horror fan I had to make myself watch. Knowing that it was clearly not a traditional zombie experience had me a bit turned off at first. However, I saw the pilot episode and I loved it. It is a bit campy but very fun and it has a crime drama spin so I think there will always be an interesting story to tell.The main characters are already very charming and have the potential to develop and evolve as the show matures. I adore the adorable yet potentially dangerous zombie and her over the top geeky medical examiner boss as well as the detective who is obviously going to be dependent on her mysterious psychic abilities. I really hope it makes the cut for CW.",2015
8,"Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of zombie-themed entertainment. While I am a horror-lover, I do not find zombies - or vampires, for that matter - to be particularly frightening. Plus, they've been done to death (haha). Particularly recently.",2015
9,"So I was not wanting to watch this because of the ""zombie"" thing because I was over it. But it kind of surprised me. I am looking to see more of it. Its not just about zombies. It has some comedy and some thrill too in it. Moreover there was a lack of women heroes so I think it will fill that. And also the girl is the cutest zombie I have ever seen. Moreover there no long intro that makes it easy to go with. Just hope they don't bring a hole family of zombies now. Also one would love how this zombie is stylish too kind of wears good clothes. So this can be a new add on for series liking people. I think it will be a good one.",2015
8,"iZombie is an interesting new take on the zombie genre. Imagine zombies that can think, walk, and talk just like the living. iZombie delivers that and a bunch more. Liv(Rose McIver) plays medical examiner. She takes on this role to have human brains handy. When she consumes those brains, she gets visions and emotions of the recently deceased. These skills allow her to capture the deceased killers. ",2015
10,"I did not think I was going to like this at all. I put off watching this show for months. I can say now, that I wish I didn't. I had thought it would be ridiculous, boring, and all over the place. I was so wrong! This series is wonderful! Great, non-ridiculous humour, delightful concept. It adds to the table of zombies, bringing forth new ideas that can make sense, while still having some of the old clichés, like: 'zombies love brains'. The actors are absolutely flawless when it comes to their jobs. I highly recommend that you watch a full episode or two before deciding what you think of it. As I said, I strongly thought I would hate it and ended up loving it!",2015
10,"The reason I am giving this a 10 is because it's so much fun, I actually started watching them late and binged watched the first five episodes where I realized the show is one heck of a ride, funny, a bit tragic and somehow charming and feel-good kinda show.",2015
7,"I admit I had high expectations having seen Veronica Mars, which may have ultimately ruined my experience with iZombie.",2016
5,"I was thrilled about the release of this series back in 2015, but didn't have a chance to get to watch it before 2016. And I had been warmly recommended to watch it, given its zombiesque nature and the entire nature of the storyline, so I was anxious to sit down and watch it.",2016
10,When i first saw izombie advertised i was convinced it wasn't for me especially as i had just recently sacked off the walking dead but i gave it whiz and what a result a complete different take on the whole zombie genre.Having not seen Rose McIver in much before she brings a breath of fresh air to the production with her constant character changes humour and infectious smile pretty difficult when your made to look dead and eat brains.The story lines and main plot themes are well put together and Rahul Kohli compliments Rose's character with his added Englishness I do hope there is a season two because this show can only develop further if Rose is looking for a part when she finishes apply for the doctor who's assistant when it comes up you would be an instant hit,2015
10,This show is awesome! Im up to date (episode 12) and I can say that it is so well written and it really just makes you NEED more. ,2015
10,"This is a Great show. The Concept is that of a police procedural with many strange twists. The show earns praise from me for being one of the few of this genre that does not claim that the forensic lab gets instant results. Instead it shows that most police work is still leg work, leads, and interrogation(kudos.) Now, on to the weird stuff. Liv Moore(Rose McIver) was a promising doctor until she was scratched by a drug induced zombie, leaving her craving brains. Now she has left her career in medicine(for fear of infecting someone) for the morgue with its convenient supply of brains. Liv aids Detective Clive Babineaux using the visions she gets from the deceased's brains. This is well played with the visions coming in random spurts, giving her(and us) tantalizing glimpses into the murder, while maintaining an air of mystery. She passes this off as being psychic, which can be very fun on occasions.",2015
9,"I'm somewhat disappointed with some of these reviews. People are saying that it isn't worth 8 because it's, and I quote ""Like asking a girly-girl to write a zombie flick""",2015

I'm a very busy person so it's hard trying to keep up with the show we need air on the original date so basically I wait to they put on their website and I watch shows. Like I don't think they have a way to tell if people are going back and watching the shows but I for one really like so it's different it's not like any of the zombie show of seem like the walking dead or any show it's different it's not like any of the zombie show of seem like the walking dead . This show puts a different twist on house and that's basically why I like the show. ,2015
1,"A lot of pretty mediocre series are getting 8+ reviews. This a 6 at best. I watched 2 episodes, even though the trailer picture of this should have warned me: A Christina Ricci type beautiful zombie (should there ever be such thing as a beautiful zombie????) with a tongue in cheek look on her face and a plate of noodles covered with some brains. It just screams teenie bopper crap... Why people can not see series for what they are, even if they like them? For instance, personally I enjoyed Crossbones with John Malkovitch a lot. If you'd ask me to rate it, I'd give it a 6.1. Why? because even though I love the genre and love to see JM in action, that's all this series is worth. Not everything you like has to be an 8 or 9. Are these all real figures or is the industry meddling with these results?? Terrible... IMDb used to be some kind of standard, now it has gone Rotten Tomatoes....",2015

4,"Look, I get that there are some people out there who would upvote anything they like 10/10, regardless of quality or depth. The problem is, when you're dealing with something that only people like that would watch, you get mediocre, redundant series (and films) with 8+ ratings. I don't think it's wrong, but it's kind of boring. If that's what it takes to justify institutional art criticism... The series itself is boring in the extreme. The setting is formulaic - teenage comedy based on a flimsy premise: a young, good-looking girl becomes a zombie, but, instead of becoming a complete outcast, learns to use her ""gift"" to good end. The problem? She has to eat human brains on the regular. The solution? Get a job at the coroner's office. The perks? She gets to see visions of how her ""clients"" died. These look like fantastic ingredients for a wacky comedy-horror. Except that they aren't. The lead character isn't only dealing with being a zombie - she's also heartbroken (dumped her fiancé because of her ""condition""), blissfully ignorant of the larger ramifications of her status (it's clear from the outset she CANNOT be the only one zombie out there), perfectly free from any turmoil caused by being a zombie (her social life only suffers because she sulks, her ""illness"" doesn't transmit in any way, and her hunger is easily satiated)... There's no real drama here, but there also can be no real pleasure in watching this unfold. The producers did all in their power to make the series attractive. Wanna zombie crime-solver? Got it. An attractive zombie? Yup. A popular neo-noir setting? Seattle, here we come! But they simply can't juggle both the comedy and the horror. The eventual mix is rich in unfunny jokes and unsurprising twists. The pilot might be the most depressing comedy script I've seen in months. It doesn't help that the lead is also the narrator - her blissful ignorance of anything beyond the immediate setting of the story transfers into the narration, making the viewer feel he's being dumbed out by the minute. The association with Veronica Mars is right on the money - this is all plastic, no story. I'm sure there's a sizeable audience for things like these (plastic goods are always popular, and sometimes even not that bad), but they clearly aren't worth 8+ in ratings - not even when the raters are all under 18. There doesn't even seem to be any rebellion involved in how the story is told: despite her ""special"" status, the lead mostly plays the dumb blonde to the smart (her superior) and the tough (her policeman-sidekick). It doesn't help that the smart is of an Asian ethnicity, and the tough is black. I can't think of one feature of this series that doesn't scream ""boring"" back at me...",2015

It is emotional to witness Bilal's growth and evolution as a character living in a world torn by violence and inequality. The camera work, the music and sound design were all top notch. I loved the battle! Ian Mcshane was very believable and menacing as Umayya and Adewale did a great job bringing legitimacy to Bilal's character. The rest of the acting was also very good!

I was very impressed by how they got the mood just right and how you could just feel the emotion. The music and the animation are extremely well done. Another great part of this movie is the animation. People these days are getting so used to computer animation that when they see stop-motion, the first thing they think about are all the flaws in the movie. To me, that is the beauty of it.

9,"The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.",2015
10,"More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic."" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.",2015
7,"The wait is over. Since the trailer came out, I watched it several times a week. That's how hyped up I was. I finally got to watch Sicario, Denis Villeneuve's latest film. It got a very positive reception at the Cannes festival, and got tons of praise from movie critics worldwide.",2015

8,"Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast.",2015

8,"Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that's sure to give your heart its full day's work, Denis Villenueve's masterful ""Sicario"" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve's direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that's been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.",2015
8,"Sicario ('Hitman' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future. To tell more would spoil what is a dense and complex storyline that evolves in a most satisfactory manner.",2016

3,"The overall ideas and the way they present the scenes were intense and received quite the reaction it perhaps intended. First few minutes with scary death bodies inside the walls were very promising. However, most of the plots are poorly written, is it real that a big cartel was only guarded by few people? But the other (men) lead characters played their part okay, they lifted the poorly written story a little bit.",2015
10,"Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.",2016
2,"Sicario doesn't live up to the hype. Emily Blunt's character runs around and stumbles upon things like she's Bella Swan from Twilight: New Moon. Benicio Del Toro's character's story is the most interesting part of the movie but, his story doesn't come about until halfway into the movie. Emily Blunt is completely underutilized here; Her character makes some of the stupidest decisions but, some of it is justified. All Emily Blunt really does in this movie is stumble upon things, makes stupid decisions, and smokes a ton of cigarettes. Benicio Del Toro is a bad-ass in this movie and his scenes are the most interesting, but Del Toro's story isn't engaging enough because it is lacking what the rest of the movie is lacking... a story. Sicario plays more on beats, tone, images, and simplicity rather than dramatic story elements and sentimental emotion. This movie is extremely blood soaked, violent, and sometimes haunting, but that's all it has going for it. This movie means nothing, it starts nowhere, and it ends nowhere. The movie is 100% predictable minus a couple of moments with Del Toro towards the end. If you want to see a boring tension-filled blood-soaked horror feast than enjoy. If you want to see an engaging and emotionally charged character driven story (including all of the extreme blood-soaked horror violence) than pass on this one because it's not present.",2015
10,Director: Denis Villeneuve,2015
6,"This movie gets way too much hype for the fantasy that it actually is. The vast majority of murders and kidnappings in the Mexico cartel wars are carried out by males in their 20s and in mostly amateur fashion. The depiction of the Super Sicario here is pure Hollywood. The idea of a Super Sicario who expertly hunts down American agents and moves within their ranks is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the idea that there are delta force (type) raids and assassinations going on with U.S. military or covert assets is simply not accurate. When a Mexican cartel boss or lieutenant is brought down in real life, it's generally in boring fashion while they hide in a hotel room or get involved in a shootout with a rival cartel. Finally, illegal practices such as torture are glamorized and depicted as effective, when all real-world intel gathering professionals will tell you otherwise. Cross border tunnel raids in which dozens are killed is just the icing on the Hollywood cake. ",2017

3,"What is it with so many movies these days? Mumbling, diffuse dialog that can barely be heard, never mind understood. Worst offender - Emily Blunt. She breathes or snorts or exhales out her nonsensical, spare lines.

2,It gets one star for the beginning of this movie when it shocks you with people death and walled in to a house. The ending of that scene reduces a lot of the shock by not taking in the account of checking everything properly in such a big operation as this seems to be. This happens multiple times in the movie and I was really missing the technological advancement these sort of agency's usually have.,2015
1,"Halfway through I wondered whether this might be a piece of experimental filmmaking to see whether its possible to maintain a lead character who has absolutely no agency whatsoever. It was afterwards, when I found out the script was by one of the bros behind Sons of Anarchy, where my having just sat through two hours of the only female character being ferried around by all the manly men whilst crying and asking what she should do next made perfect sense.",2015
6,"SICARIO is an intense and gritty drug war thriller that follows an FBI agent as she teams up with some DEA agents to wage war on drug gangs in south-of-the-border Mexico. It's a film that features oodles of gritty realism, along with graphic depictions of violence and the like, much like Denis Villeneuve's previous movie PRISONERS. The grand, epic-style action sequences that fuel SICARIO make it a superior film to that, although I still found it a little lacking.",2017

Like how could someone find the inner strength to kill their own father is beyond me and travel to find Luke Skywalker and he doesn't even talk in the movie like come on! A dead rip off of the original movie, Episode 4. From the crappy looking infinity CG roll opening sequence, bar scene and light sabre fights to a janitor identifying a weakness in the battle star, this movie is chock full of inside jokes and tired ideas. The only redeeming grace for this movie is a solid performance by Harrison Ford as Han Solo and a compelling performance by Daisy Ridley as Rey who represents the resurrection of the Jedi.

It was a remake and CGI orgy for the hard-core fans. The only positive things were the visual effects (X-wings vs Ties). Indeed this story played somewhere in the SW universe (well more punctually somewhere between the SW universe and a MAD MAX world).

The dialogue was superb, the fx magnificent and it all adds up to the perfect continuation of a cult classic. I didn't even realize that I had a hole in my life until today... a hole ladies and gentlemen that only ash and the evil dead could fill. LoL. I look forward to this show going on for years until they have to drag Bruce's geriatric ass to the set and push cocaine down his throat to make one more episode. Again, hats off and congratulations on a masterpiece. ENCORE!! ENCORE!! ENCORE!!!!!!!",2015
10,"I have to admit, i had high hopes for this show, only because Bruce Campbell ""my favorite evil dead hero"" is back. Usually, the pilot of nowadays shows fail to impress, they either succeed later or keep falling to their doom. The case is different for this one. The first episode was absolutely a blast. there was no unnecessary dialog, no boring characters, no bullshit. There is one clear fact about it. Evil is back and is not messing around or waiting. its coming with full weight. the episode is packed with amazing action, cheesy conversations and a lot of humor which is exactly what made the original movie a success. it will keep you entertain from start to finish, and leaving you wanting more. I'am looking forward to see the rest of the show. and i would recommend it to everyone.",2015
10,"Was really hoping this was going to kick ass and it certainly does. It's Evil Dead-tastic. Fans of the films will certainly not be disappointed, cheesy jokes, gore and chainsaw/shotgun action against the Dead-ites abounds. It feels like a natural extension of Evil Dead 2, with Ash gone to seed and feeling the miles as he straps on the shotgun to do battle again. Brilliant. With a massive amount of practical FX on the go and a real lo-fi feel to the whole affair it's like a Saturday night VHS gore-fest all over again. The pacing, laughs and splatters come thick and fast, it just feels right and is pitched at just the right level for the nostalgia crowd and the horror fans alike. Winner!!",2015

It has been over 20 years since the last time Ash fought deadites and he has taken a long vacation until the evil has struck again and Ash is sprung back in action with his chainsaw and boomstick back in his possession.

Thank you for making it a loyal to a T. Can't wait to watch the rest. The plot is still like the original but in a modern concept, love all the original stuff. The ghouls are awesome and still scare you silly. About time you came back Mr. Campbell and what about Lucy Lawless, OMG Love this actress.I hope it will last long because there is no other shows like this out there.I do hope we do find out who the lady cop really is. So if you guys love your classic, take time to watch this, it will be worth your while.",2015
10,"I've already watched the 1st episode 4 times. I feel like I have to watch it again. I'm willing to bet Sam Raimi has a lot up his sleeve for the episodes to come. It's been a long wait and I wasn't expecting a good of start that it did. I was very excited to watch it and they pulled no stops. It has lived up to and went far beyond what I was hoping. The most epic part of this episode is, Ash flying, like Superman to catch the chainsaw. Sam had said he didn't think they could get nearly enough money to put together a new sequel. I'll bet the people who could have got the money to back it are crying right now. In fact, I believe this series type endeavor they have started could have been the better way to go. This way, there's always another episode coming and I wait on the edge of my seat for them. Acting, directing, screen writing...all across the board is superb. I don't recall any movie or series to start out with such high recommendations. I mean, 9.5 out of 10? That's unheard of on IMDb. Finally, there's something on TV that is worth watching, which isn't too likely these days. Yeah, it's going to be a GROOVEY ride !",2015
10,"I love that! All the old-style evil dead and Bruce. Good idea don't add ""innovation"" but stay on the style of the trilogy, new ""fans"" need to understand, ""old"" fans will love it. I think is a big lesson for who make remake of old series or movies. Simplicity win in this case and in future if something wrong will happen i'm sure fans will support, because Ash didn't betray himself. A big lesson learned too: where you hide your Necronomicon copy? Under the xxx mag and weed. This and many other gag are in line with the Ash character. The new fans don't expect big effects, Ash don't need that, especially in this series that finally Ash is more present in the scenes than before.",2015
10,"I am a tad to cynical to laugh easily. I have seen many, many TV shows - and I laughed plenty watching the first episode. I have seen the Evil Dead movies as a younger person and I was concerned that this would not match my expectations. Wrong! Bruce is fantastic in the role of Ash (who else could play that role) and he has an excellent cast of colleagues. Such a good blend of humour and horror. Kudos to Sam Raimi, Bruce and all involved. Excellent entertainment. While being a horror buff in my younger days, I now prefer horror with a twist - and preferably humour as the twist. Hoping that the fun will continue for the rest of the season.",2015

Following in the footsteps of Army of Darkness, Ash vs. Evil Dead offers the always entertaining Bruce Campbell as an aging and utterly obnoxious anti-hero whose unique ability to kill ""deadites"" is only matched by the utter stupidity that causes him to release supernatural evil into the world in the first episode to impress a girl.

8,I wanted to write this review to appeal to someone like myself. This show appeals clearly to the targeted audience that followed the movies.

Bruce Campbell is brilliant of course, this show simply would not be so good without him. Often I find that horror movies or shows don't get the right balance between comedy and drama, Ash vs Evil Dead gets it just right. The last time I saw such a good balance between the two genres was Zombieland. The cast is truly excellent, it's not Bruce Campbell and the rest. Dana DeLorenzo, Jill Marie Jones & Ray Santiago are all fantastic and we all know how good Lucy Lawless is. She only makes a brief appearance in the pilot but I expect her to have a stronger presence from now on. I have to add one little spoiler, Ash releases the demons because he is drunkenly showing off to a girl and trying to get laid, it's a little flashback scene and very funny. Anyway I have to go, talking about the show has made me want to watch it again.",2015

I have never expected to see this again that too on television. I have waited almost 23 years for this.1st episode of Ash vs Evil dead is superb. It has all the ingredients we have seen in the evil dead movies. The sequence where the two cops enter in a haunted house is mind blowing and scary as hell.I am very happy to see Bruce back in action (doggy).He still looks young at this age. I was disappointed with the direction of Sam Raimi in the last couple of his movies and i whole heartedly wanted something like evil dead and he is back with a bang. Sam has showed us that his form will never go down when it comes to evil dead.He is really good at it.There is a saying ""form is temporary but the class is permanent"". He is a class act. This time his direction is fantastic.Thanks Sam and Bruce for bringing this classic on television. Nothing gets better than this.Only fools and lunatic people will hate this.It has Blockbuster written all over it. It's a treat for the Evil dead fans and horror genre lovers.Keep em coming.Strongly Recommended.",2015

I watched the show anticipating disappointment, and I feel quite the opposite. Even not knowing the originals, this show can stand up in it's own right. This show has been given love and attention it deserves. I believe they are doing it justice in a well made revamp. I saw Bruce Campbell in something a couple of years ago, they still call me Bruce or something, i turned it off after 15mins, I nearly took it back to the video store and asked for my $2 back. I anticipated that here, but was delighted at what I've seen so far. The gore, the characters, the action, momentum. Ash the lovable blowhard. Bruce is a class act all the way.

It brought back all the memories of the first 3 films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic Park 1 did ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". The new park looked amazing showing that John Hammond'so dream finally came true. The music was more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence.

Earlier Jurissic Park had used some puppets .The movie is made in style of an amusement park .It seems that the character development is shorter for the sake of the action.In some out takes that was shown ,flat, indicated that may be some of the shots should have been kept of the character development.It was not even.Did you see the little old fashion camera that the smaller nephew was carrying?could indicate Hollywood dislike towards home digital cameras?Chis originally did a you tube joke about him getting a job in Spielberg's next Jurassic movie .I think it was you tube.His dreams came true. Another problem was that the characters and the whole atmosphere of the movies and sets were cold and stoic.Even the kissing scene was cold and the family reunion scene,which Claire's sisters husband was played by Andy Buckley, was also not warm..E.T ,Poltergeists and Star Wars was far more Warmer.What's the problem?I am afraid it's a real world currently problems in general.Hollywood has always pretentiously serve the establishment ,for profit,then claims they serve the masses.This movie reflects our phony liberal side of big business and the wealthy running our government and exploiting the animal rights and environmentalist ,who are desperate for a quick answer to protect animals and the environment as well a s fanatics and those who have a contempt against the human race ,due to constant warmongering ,for profit and political power.This reflects pitting animals and the environment against humans ,very subtle, in this film,but,this is an outer problem.In spite of this it is an excellence film,Gorgeous sets and realistic dinosaurs ,Bryce in her 1970's hair do,which has become popular again and handsome leading man Chris Pratt.I was certainly satisfied with this movie.Both 3D and flat were good. The sound was arousing and excellent .No out of synchronizing problems here,since both images are in a folder stabled .Great for Dino fans and 3D fans. 10/21/15",2015
10,Jurassic World is the Jurassic Park of this generation. It returns us to the island where it began for an amazing feature presentation with live dinosaurs and one not so real one. Overall the movie was visually stunning and really stood out from movies of this generation. It gives you a chance to see what a true dinosaur theme park would look like. The cast was well cat and both worked off of the chemistry from each other. The dinosaurs were so realistic and it was truly terrifying.? The movie also had a good story to follow. It was able to keep me in my seat for the entire time and demanding more. The dinosaur blockbuster also earned over 1.6 billion in the global box office. People still aren't done with dinosaurs and neither should you. I'd give this movie a shot. You will not regret it.,2016
10,"It's been awhile I think that I have labeled a film ""a thrill ride"" but seriously though this film was a real thrill ride. It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.",2015
10,"As an Avid Jurassic Park fan except for JP3. This film hit me a well thought after movie. There were some draw backs that you read in the comments pages like how could Claire out run a T-Rex in hill and another which i do agree with is that the kids should have been eaten because they were to whiny. It hard to replace performances from the original cast who played lex and tim. As for the CG and Graphics I'm always blown away on how it keeps changing and the dinosaurs always look better. as well as adding a hybrid well, let me tell great choice of adding a raptor rex mix. As the film progressed I was hoping for more dinos in the scene such a the mosasaurus. Other than that I give this film a big thumbs up.",2016
10,"A really thrill of a ride. The Indominous Rex was a really cool idea and handed well. A lot of action and storyline. Most characters developed well and the last scene was a peach! However, there were some faults but they didn't destroy the film in any way, shape or form.",2015
10,"First of all I think people need to understand that film is a lot like music, you can't listen to a new Justin Bieber song and complain because it's not a Mozart masterpiece. And you definitely can't watch Jurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type film. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael Bay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go through any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly entertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious throughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors to the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new unimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's rated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two years past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things, a plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did in 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction. We will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing the gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that Raptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what happens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are only a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the end, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and gives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the film keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and they did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are incredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your seat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have nothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just climbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption, well please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I think that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another for it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it a 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a comparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement and a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone who like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to just sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can only say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too after you watch it.",2015
10,"I watched this movie on my way home from NZ on the plane, when I first started the movie I was a half asleep, grumpy and jet-legged girl sitting on a flight for 13 hours next to a snoring middle aged man. I was just hoping this film would keep me awake, luckily within the first 15 mins of this film I was already attached to the characters and as the film carried on you could start to tell what suddenly was going to happen for the two characters Zach and Gray. At this point I was literally yelling at the screen telling the characters to either 'watch out', 'run' or 'move out of the way'. I'm pretty sure I ended up waking the guy next to me up, but I didn't really care at that point I was too busy watching this movie to really notice. As soon as I finished this movie I was shouting at my brother on a different row to watch this film because it was one of the best I had ever seen, I was literally in love!!!",2016
10,"I had my doubts about Jurassic World when the trailers debuted last year. But they kept getting better and better until I finally thought to myself, ""this might be a good one."" Believe it or not, I was right. The main characters of Claire and Owen, the music by Michael Giacchino, and the concept of an open Dinosaur park really drove the story to its potential as a good sequel. Every movie has their problems, and this one did have a few but not enough to say that I was mislead. The audience and critics may be all over the place with this movie but hey, Haters gonna hate. This is truly the best sequel to Jurassic Park to me and has earned its place with the best sequels along with the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you see the film, see it with your own mindset and not what other people say.",2015

10,"17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good. Wouldn't mind watching it again......oh and Chris Prattt.....yum.",2015
10,The first three Jurassic park movie are very scary. But this movie is scarier. 7.1 is underrating this movie. This is one of the scariest movies of all time. It is better then 7.1. All the Jurassic Park movie are great movies and this is the best one. This is one of the best scenes fiction movie of all time. This movie has great special effects. It also has a great story line. It also has great acting. Colin Trevorrow is a great director. Chris Pratt is a great actor. Bryce Dallas Howard is a great actresses. Ty Simpkins is a great actor. Nick Robinson is a great actor. See this movie. See all the Jurassic park movies.,2016

10,"I just recently watched the movie Jurassic World and needless to say, it was EXCELLENT...",2015
9,"As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to ""spare no expense"", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to commercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, ""so how about Pepsi-Saurus""? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why I'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.",2015
3,"A dull monster movie without ideas, with all the imaginable problems: recycled soundtrack from the previous three film, poor visual effects (the '93 film was indeed better even under this aspect, and that says it all), horrible ""dinosaurs"" that look more Godzilla than ""true"" animals (and yes, it's a very serious problem that these animals don't look or/and act as real animals, at least as they're conceived to be in XXI century and not in '40s), badly-written dialogs (with a sort of ""love story"" that is embarrassing), characters (dull not to say stupid) and plot. All this problems all in once, and without any decency. To conclude there are the two boys, the most boring and annoying characters in the Hollywood's history.",2016
10,"OK movie lovers, this is the review you need to see.",2015
10,"OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.",2015

All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film since I saw it. I love Jurrasic World, best film in ages.",2015
10,"I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a ""near-masterpiece"" like The Outsiders and The Aviator.",2015
10,"I loved this movie. I don't understand some of the negative ratings here. This is not a Fellini movie we're reviewing. It's dinosaurs. And plenty of them. I think this is every bit as good as JPI and way better than the other two. There's plenty of action. There are strong characters, big dinosaurs, spectacular special effects. Add a star because it's scary without being gruesome. The plot is plausible in a movie that's based on a totally fantastical platform to start with. Go see it. Definitely one to see on the big screen. It's got a huge box office for a reason. People spontaneously clapped at the start of the ending credits. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie where that happened.",2015

10,"The Lost World stank, Jurassic Park III was just okay (PTEROSAURS make up for a lot of deficiencies) but this film is in every way up to the standards of the original. I enjoyed myself thoroughly except for having to listen to the shrieks of the terrified little kids whose parents were sadistically forcing them to sit through it. In my opinion this film would merit a PG-13 as it features more gore and genuinely horrific moments than any of the previous Jurassic films, so if you're planning on taking your babies to it so they can see the funny dinosaurs, really, think again.",2015

Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road.

Personally, these type of action movies bore me to tears, because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences. In terms of story, the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point. Then they fight, then one of them wins. As an audience member, I'm ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting. And I really need the lead characters to have some logical reasons for doing what they are doing. ",2015

I was a fan of the original Mad Max and at first Tom Hardy seemed like a great actor for the role, but this movie didn't do him justice. He did well as Bane but he wasn't the star in this movie, almost like a support character. I almost fell asleep and left the theater because I can find better ways to waste my time. The only positive thing I can say is that the world looks great as well as the props. Good job on that George Miller. At least there's something good about it. The trailer was promising and since many people praised this movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time ""to indulge in the deep content and story it provides"". There was absolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictator who holds all the water and controls the people.

1,"This must be one of the worst movies of all time. 2 hours of shootings and blasts. There is a lot of action, but it is the same through the hole movie. People left the theater before the movie ended, There is no story. It's a chase for 2 hours, where the main character (should be) Mad Max has a role as a sidekick. The movie title should have been ""Furiousa"". Mad Max has only a few lines, and after each sentence, he growls. The movie starts of well, but after 15 min. It is downhill with silly conversation. Normally a good action movie should be entertaining and you Would leave the theater with a smile, but not here. Then in the middle, we have a lot of fire, shootings and blasts and a lot of stunt/animated scenes. But it does not have any power It's just the same over and over again. The end has a brief rise, but again ends poorly and foreseen. The old Mad Max movies starring Mel Gibson had power and lines with humor and bite. Maybe they are going for a new story in this movie.....but there is none to be found. Crap!",2015

So lets start,i had been desperately waiting for this movie since long and today i got a chance to watch it and after watching it i was left agape with incredulity that how a movie like this is being applauded by the masses , Seriously it had nothing, except for extraordinary nonsense action. This movie is devoid of a sane story but in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in recent history. Mad max fury road is highly overrated and is mocking other movies which have ratings between 8 and 8.7. Albeit, I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Chalize Therone but their acting could not save it from becoming a complete ruin. i am giving it a one point and seriously if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i would have given it much lower points. Its also a suggestion to IMDb developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations.

Do not expect any engaging drama or any plot of any kind, but here's the story: post apocalypse, no water (yet there are hundreds of people alive and working), no fuel (yet they all have it in their vehicles), women escaping – women returning back the same day.

What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome.

4,I was so amped for Mad Max after seeing the average review was high... WTF? Is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie was not good... No character arcs except for Nux and his was so contrived and abrupt that it shouldn't count... the basic story was very lame... the plot was goofy... all the 2D character villains with their bizarre mutations (the hovering baby-man? This movie had shades of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie... I'll investigate the user reviews here more closely next time so I don't get burned again... I still hope to see some awesome Furiosa cosplayers in the future so that adds a few stars.,2015

It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.

Yes, but in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be taken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever post-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to happen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50% of the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie, yeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie half-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What a stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and when they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again, not ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a movie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a storyline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline... what storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie, Silent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he survived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa (Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw Ruler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the bad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the movie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with them this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast milk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the semi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where they are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that somehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They tell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back to where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing them, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making they're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector, you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half. The get there, with the dead body of Immortal Joe (yep, he died.) and become the ruler (I guess) of these Mountains that miraculously has tons of water, that no one has any clue where it comes from. Max leaves! The Pathetic End!",2015
10,"Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen.",2015
10,"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot. Must watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket.",2015
1,"To be honest I went into watching this film with a negative mind anyway as I had heard that it was just crazy people driving round a desert. They were not wrong. It was terrible. Tom hardy just grunts most of the time and it is called mad max but it is barely about him. He doesn't do much in it. It is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it. And then when I finally had a feeling of relief because I thought the film had ended it hadn't, they pick up some old ladies and turn back round and go down the same way they just came from to have very similar fights, in the same places, with the same people except the old ladies they pick up die. So it's just pointless but rubbish fighting all the way through with big cars, lots of fire and no good story. This is a typical boys film. I normally love action films with cars and fights but this was just repetitive and boring.it didn't excite me, make me laugh, shock me or make me want to know what was going to happen next. Waste of two hours of my life.",2015
9,"I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",2015
9,"In a way, BBC's The Last Kingdom is a first ever experience for me. It's certainly not the first series I watch, nor it's the first series based on books, not even historical fiction books. But it's the first series which I'd read the books it is based on way before it was even announced. So seeing it rumored, then officially announced and finally premiered was very interesting and exciting. I had a lot of hopes and fears for this. And I'm so gladly to say that based on the first two episodes of the series, my hopes were made into reality and my fears into joy. And so, inspired me to write my first review here.",2015
7,"For a medieval adventure, The Last Kingdom moves at a strikingly fast pace with unhinged ferocity and undiplomatic cultural clash. Audience might be familiar with The Vikings and it does have similar characters. Both series sets in the same timeline and world, but this one is told from the perspective of an England boy. This is a fresh rendition of epic saga that creates solid characters in highly perilous time, relying less on stylish ambiance and more on gritty dusty violence.",2015
9,"I am a big fan of the books, so I was worried that this would not work for me.",2015
10,"I've heard of the books but have yet to read them. I binged watched the 1st 3 episodes so far, and was surprised that I really liked the adaptation. I've seen other pieces of this period (The Vikings, The Bastard Executioner) recently and liked this much more. I'm sort of glad I didn't read the Cornwell's books before seeing the show, as I did with the Outlander Series. I was constantly comparing the Outlander books to the show and disappointed at times that it was not same as the books which I loved. I'm sure the readers of Bernard Cornwell's books will be doing the same. However, not knowing the original story, I can just judge the show on what I see presented.",2015
9,"Uhtred is a young boy who lives a quite life in a small village, But his life is turned upside down when Vikings descend upon the village walls, His brother who is tasked with scouting ahead is beheaded and his father marches to war and he is told he must stay behind with his uncle, As he is heir to the throne. However the boy is somewhat like his father, Stubborn and filled with rage. He defies orders and races after his father. ",2015
10,"Another BBC series hit! I am a big fan of Vikings, and am therefore suspicious of all imitations. But I must say that I am loving this show! The atmosphere and backdrop have a very authentic feel and the acting is superb. My favorites characters of this series are Uhtred and King Alfred. Uhtred's identity dilemma and King Alfred's presence as a wise and noble king are captivating. Their chemistry with each other creates a very interesting drama as they go back and forth with each other. As good as the characters and writing are, it is the acting that breath life into both. Make it part of your weekly viewing and you'll be rewarded. Well done!",2015
9,I really like this which is another hit rather than a miss for the BBC. The Last Kingdom now joins Wolf Hall and Poldark in its ability to transport me back in time.,2015
9,"Absolutely loved this series, one of those I looked at beforehand and thought I wouldn't like, it looked like another Game of Thrones themed series, along the same lines as Vikings. It's a period in history that I know relatively nothing about, so it's an interesting theme for a drama to explore, I can't comment on the accuracy of the series as I don't know enough about it.",2015
7,"I will not summarize the plot of THE LAST KINGDOM, as it follows a familiar quest-pattern and has been amply described by previous reviewers. Suffice to say that the source-text's author is Bernard Cornwell, an established writer of historical adventures set in various historical periods that have translated successfully to television in the past (remember SHARPE (1993-2008))?",2015
9,"I'll admit I've read just about everything Bernard Cornwell has ever written, and thoroughly enjoyed the premiere. After slogging through the Bastard Executioner, this series is refreshingly straight forward. Some high points: The depiction of a shield wall was awesome, Ravn is perfectly cast, uhtred as a child was great, the opening credits . Not sure about: How the casting of adult Uhtred will pan out, would be nice to see some development of Brida's character, how much plot can be crammed into each episode? I'm a bit disappointed that so much of the plot was condensed into episode one. Those unfamiliar with Cornwell's work might not enjoy the series quite as much.",2015
8,"I've noticed that there have been a lot of Medieval/Vikings shows lately. Vikings, The Bastard Executioner, and The Last Kingdom are just a few examples of the well known ones. This first episode really convinced me that this show will be worth watching. The story telling and development was alright for the most part, if anything it might have paced along too fast for me. To lose 2 important historical characters like that straight out the gate really left me a little concerned for the story-line later on. I don't think that this show will follow the historical timelines to a T, but it will have some relevant moments.",2015
10,"With the plethora of mediocre historical series out there, I did not expect much from this show. I, however, was utterly blown away by how compelling it is, and by the excellent acting by all. The subject matter is fascinating, and it depicts well the harshness of living, and surviving, in a barbarous world, with an emerging, equally barbarous ""new"" religion. The casting was terrific. The actor who played Scorpa, the Dane of the White Horse, was beyond fierce. An unforgettable presence. I was especially, impressed by the lead, Alexander Dreymon, whom I had never seen before. As the series progresses, you really see this guy's acting chops. His range is from the tender to the ferocious. He has a bunch of us hooked, and we cannot wait for the next season. ",2016
10,"Well what can I say? The producer has had a massive chalange to shortcut all the the parts of the novel, which should only stay at the novel, and get straight to the point. The TV series are called ""The Last Kingdom"" NOT ""Uhtred and his beloved Danes"" or ""Great Vikings of the Norse"". Some may complain that The Last Kingdom TV series are taking away from understanding the Viking ways, but think about it for a moment, do we want to watch another ""Viking"" series..., do we really? Are we not tired of the same over and over again? I would not want to beat ahead of the drums, but it seems like the series would concentrate on Alfred the Great and the history of newly born Engaland. ",2015
10,An Excellent portrayal of an era that was so bloody & required so much Strength - so here you see the true Warriors that have built our lands today - They gave so much to be True & to be Free so how can anyone dis-respect their Battles !!!!!! ,2016
5,"Just like the curate's egg, this is good in parts. Sadly, the good parts are far fewer than the not so good.",2015
9,I bought several of the books and tried to read them but ended up not getting half way through the first one! However I am loving this series and can't wait for each episode. This series is similar to the series Vikings but is based in England at around the time that Vikings had taken control of a lot of England. ,2015
2,"When I started watching this, I was convinced that it was trying to be a comical parody of programmes like Vikings or game of thrones. I think other reviews are being over supportive because us In Britain want to be Able to say that we've produce a great period/fantasy piece like the two shows mentioned. Except it's laughably poor. It's horribly melodramatic and the lead is a discount Brendan Frasier look alike. Honestly some of the acting performances are so dramatic that they make me want to cringe and convulse. Some of the writing it so poor as well. I'd say the only saving grace of the show is that it's so poor that occasionally it makes me laugh at how something this (insert appropriate profane language) was actually funded, I know plenty of budding young writers and directors in England that would kill for the opportunity to produce such a project. Argsgwhhrjrejrbhr... Honestly atrocious, appalling a complete travesty.",2015
1,"Being a keen fan and reader of the Anglo-Saxon period, I was thrilled to learn that author Bernard Cornwell's first two books in the Uthred series were to be the subject of an eight-part TV series. Having now watched all eight episodes, I'm left wondering what the producers of the TV series were actually trying to achieve, it certainly wasn't historical accuracy at any level in this slap-dash production!",2015
10,"It couldn't be any better. Amazing. Astounding. Transforming. Better than Game of Thrones and Vikings. You feel like you really know the star as a friend and as a hero. Great acting, it all seems so real, invigorating, sad and heroic.",2017
8,"I really can't say why Early Middle Ages have so much charme (I have my own theory of course but I will keep it for myself because I don't want to bore you to death) but they have, just like Bronze Age.",2015
10,"What a wonderful adaptation of the books!!! I had never heard of Alexander Dreymon until watching this series. I had purchased the kindle book a while ago but had not read it yet, watched the series first and that actually prompted me to read the book(s). Now reading the 2nd book. I liked the Viking series on the History Channel which is a nice compliment to this series as you can learn more about Ragnar. I loved the acting in The Last Kingdom! Alexander Dreymon (Uhtred), David Dawson (King Alfred) & Adrian Bower (Leofric) I think were spot on with their characters. Not to take away from the other actors in the least!!! I am no historian by any means and the programs I watch is strictly for my own enjoyment, couldn't care about anybody else's LOL!!! I will pretty much watch anything that has sword fighting which was due to my being introduced to Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. I'm a bit obsessed with it actually. And what a handsome young man Alexander Dreymon is. That certainly doesn't hurt my eyeballs!!!! After reading the book, I went back and re-watched the series and it was even more entertaining than the 1st time. Thank you so much for the wonderful entertainment!!!",2015
7,"The Last Kingdom comes as welcome relief and an antidote to the likes of ""Vikings"". Where the aforementioned series portrays the English as terrified buffoons virtually bending over to receive the Norsemen's thrust, The Last Kingdom gives a more balanced and, almost, historically accurate take on the era.",2015
10,Just saw the finale last night and I was so filled with adrenaline I couldn't sleep so I'm writing this. This season has been a true masterpiece. Each episode improved as the season went on. At first I came into this as a filler for vikings. Now I've come out waiting for vikings to use as my filler. A man born a Saxon only to be raised by Danes then to be forced to adopt the Saxon way again. The plot and premise was brilliant and the lead and rest of the casting was remarkable. The fight scenes were flawless. Despite his flaws I cannot remember loving a character as much as Utred and feel all the loss he continued to endure. This is a must watch. If you love vikings you may find yourself shocked how much you'll love this as much if not more than vikings. I'm still reeling in awe of what I just witnessed. Bravo,2015
10,"I must applaud the BBC in recent times, we are consistently being given incredibly high caliber dramas, The Last Kingdom is the very latest in a long list that includes The Game, Banished, London Spy etc. What a golden era for drama once again. The Vikings will always make for interesting TV, but it's the whole story surrounding the birth of what we now know as England that makes this exceptional. I have nothing but plaudits for Alexander Dreymon, he's done an incredible job with the lead role, I still struggle to believe he's German, his accent is uncanny. They've not gone overboard with the sex and violence as is the case with some of the similar shows. I see BAFTA awards written all over this serial.",2015

9,"Having seen the previous four 'Mission Impossible' films, I have to admit that none of them impressed me to the degree that I had hoped. I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettable",2015
10,"All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and well worth the price of admission.",2015
6,"I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's certainly worth the ticked price.",2015
8,"You would think that after five films this would have become a tired premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster makes it even better than the new James Bond films. ",2015
6,This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important ingredients:,2015
10,"Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent. Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by everyone!",2015
10,"I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format.",2015
9,"TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around).",2015
7,"After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate but he captured by his agents.

Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane (Sean Harris). A couple of months later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot. Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust?

10,Almost a masterpiece.,2015
4,"Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about it the second after it happened. ",2015
7,"Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and interesting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next (sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they made it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely won't be disappointed.",2016
6,I went last night 8/7. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because chase credit card has a buy one get one free movie ticket on Fridays. Why everyone is raving about this bore shows people are paid to write reviews. How can anyone say 10 out of 10. MI 1 was and still is the best one of the franchise. The airplane scene? Big frigging deal why is that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times. ,2015
6,"I remember when I first saw this film in theaters and the lights dimmed the first thought that ran through my head was ""Here we go again"" as I released an involuntary sigh of apathy. Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well. Tom Cruise has a mission, something goes wrong, he goes rouge, needs to find some kind of MacGuffin, the villain is some kind of terrorist arms dealer, insert random forgettable love interest here, big stunts, the end.",2015
3,"Rogue Nation delivers set piece action and thrills to satisfy most of the intended audience, but basically they are rather hackneyed and fourth rate. They do not make up for the acres of empty space at the heart of the movie's plot and characterisation. Let alone the script and direction which are utterly predictable and gone through strictly by numbers. A just about good enough film that does not try too hard. After all, predictability is the key to a franchise success, or a dreadful bore to the uncommitted and unenthusiastic - there really is only an hour's TV episode material here. True, it carries it all off with gloss and panache, but then the Chinese backers would want to be sure on a return for their investment! Tom Cruise (looking older) gives his all-American, polished, believable performance we come to expect in his action genre films, while the support cast do their thing like moving wallpaper. Rebecca Ferguson flaunting her slightly heavy thighs at almost every opportunity is an interesting choice as the femme fatale (good or bad?), but Swedish/UK cool does not add a lot to a very clichéd role. Sean Harris (unrecognisable) tries to method act the chief villain and still manages to make no impression. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman in an earlier MI, you have to chew a bit of scenery rather than stay cold at a very great distance! Can we have a franchise-free (particularly comic-based ones) and Matt Damon not lost in space year of movies, please, and get back to some straightforward, effects-free entertainment that Hollywood used to do so well!?",2015
5,"Ho hum; seen it all before. I don't understand why people seem so enamoured by this. It's like a made for TV James Bond on a bad day. Ethan Hunt isn't interesting. IMF isn't interesting. The first half was okay, but it soon degenerated into mediocrity. Too many characters, too many locations; no central focus or essential core. It wasn't really about anything. And the end; what a cop out. The writers just had to find a way to finish it; it felt rushed. I was bored with this film; it really wasn't great. And like MI:3 the music sucked; just noise pollution. Were any of the Mission Impossible movies ever that good? I don't think so. Just another movie to soon be forgotten about. Watch James Bond instead. Mission mediocrity.",2015
10,"Mission impossible Rouge Nation is directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. Most of the time when a series gets to its fifth movie, they ether have to reboot it some way or its just very bad but the mission impossible is not doing that, it is improving and getting better and better. Rouge nation might be the best MI movie yet, what makes it so great is that it takes parts of the other movies and puts them together. Rouge Nation adds more humor, more gadgets, more suspense, more everything. The acting was fantastic by everyone. Tom Cruise was amazing and the fact that he does all his stunts, just makes him one of the best action stars today. Simon Pegg stands out a lot in this one, they gave him more screen time, which is great because the chemistry between Cruise and Pegg is also great. The action was incredible and you could tell the actors were very doing it. Overall Rouge Nation was amazing and improved in everything. The action and acting was fantastic. Definitely needs to be seen in IMAX.",2015
1,"This is the first review I have ever done on IMDb...not because I don't like watching films..in fact, I adore films. Rather, I normally don't review just because I put a premium on my time, and don't want to spend time repeating what others may have already said about a given film; until today, that is. In my inaugural review, I was very motivated (I mean incensed) to write this review now having come back for the cinema, freshly infuriated in the realization that I can't get 2.5 hours of my life back after watching MI-5. I read glowing reviews before going to the film, to which I am now wondering if I saw the same film others who reviewed this film as ""highly enjoyable"". I am beyond puzzled how this film got good reviews, unless it is from reviewers who get easily bamboozled by special effects to forgive the need for a plot, or work for the makers of the film, or who are not of this earth. The planet to which these people who did liked this poor excuse for a ""film"" I do not know. Yes, I knew it would be an action film, and yes I knew one has to suspend disbelief to enjoy a film like this, but despite these prerequisites being in place in my mind going into the theater, this film content was so vacant and vapid it boggles my mind that I sat through its entirety and didn't walk out mid-film. The plot was not in the slightest way possible to follow, and the reviewers shouldn't confuse plot complexity (which a good story can have)with the nonsensical incongruity of this film. Tom Cruise--who was truly outstanding in Jerry Mcquire,the Firm, Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut-- was hardly that as an international spy. Mr Baldwin--another outstanding actor and wonderful in the Royal Tannenbaums and Blue Jasmine--but his role in this film was completely under-utilized. The other actors were alright, but its just that the plot and its presentation was just insulting to any intelligence. Endless product placements for BMW, and then when the locale of different places were indicated when they showed in an areal pan shot its a bit much to say show the US Congress and Washington Monument, combined with the need to type in the upper right corner...""Washington D.C."", just to make it look official and inform us that we are in Washington D.C. just in case one didn't know..I can't remember if the pan shot of Big Ben was accompanied by the words ""London, England"". If you are looking for a similar action/conspiracy spy film with slick international intrigue with believable characters, I highly recommend ""The International"" out a few years back. In sum, please, save your time, stay at home and watch paint dry for a more redeeming experience.",2015
1,"When it comes to entertainment, Tom Cruise is the one guy you can count on. His last release, Edge of Tomorrow, is a spectacular example of intelligent entertainment, with not a dull or lifeless moment in it. The last MI was the best action flick of the year. The reason it worked so well was that none of the action was forced and everything seemed to be in a flow. ",2015
3,"Went to see it last night, after looking forward to it, but unfortunately I have to say that it is probably one of the worst MI films to date!",2015
5,Pros:,2015
1,"Saw the movie last Saturday, we both fell asleep during parts of the film. The length was too long and the dialog nearly incomprehensible. A terrible end to what was a good set of sequels. The opening scene was too staged and no clearly defined plot. Was that goof ball trying to open the doors did he not know Russian and on a mission inside of Russia! Unbelievable to say the least and not suspenseful or exciting in any form. The dialog between actors was so stilted as to be boring which causes us to nod off more than once during the film. MI in the past were not only exciting but kept you in suspense until nearly the very end, none of that this time around.",2015
10,"My most anticipated movie of this year and luckily enough, I had the pleasure... the utmost pleasure of watching it at an advance screening! Loving Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol so much that I'd given it a near perfect rating, I was skeptical and expecting at least a bit of a letdown as I simply couldn't see how they'd top that. Also, I had only limited myself to 2 trailers as I already felt I knew far too much, which only increased my anxiety. Still, I couldn't help but have expectations; my excitement level had peaked before even going into the cinema!",2015
9,"A lot has been said and written about this film, mostly about its troubled production - forget all that: it has no meaning whatsoever for the experience this film provides. A word of advice though: if you go in expecting a testosterone-fueled revenge thriller in the vein of 'Apocalypto', you'll likely end up disappointed. It's simply not that kind of film - but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you watch it with the right expectations.",2015
3,"You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.",2016
8,"The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly. ",2016
7,"The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization. Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. ",2016
3,What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours.,2016
9,"Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, Iñárritu is also the star of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet powerful storytelling. You can tell Iñárritu poured his heart into this project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so impactful had another director been at the helm. ",2016
1,"If ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it. Visually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than that. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a painting or a photo for 2 and a half hours.",2016
10,Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible.,2016
9,"I went to see ""The Revenant"" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an ""epic art-house western"" and that's a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike ""The Hateful Eight"" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.",2016
1,"I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's standard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems to have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor. ",2016
8,"""The Revenant"" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).",2016
1,"Utter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the most boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story. Leonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar for Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to act. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit in a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed to be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's character, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved, dehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and rides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.",2016
1,What a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30 seconds.,2016
1,"In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly & left for dead, but managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music & gray-scale tones throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting & ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?",2016
3,"I cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there are not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are unbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the wilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not getting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold water.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god the list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me started...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing was a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to back the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also ridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.",2016
1,"(As e-mailed to my few relatives, to impart the fair warning not to see this silly and execrable film.)",2016
1,Unbelievable bad movie!,2016
5,"I made the mistake of reading up on the life of the real Hugh Glass (the character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) before seeing the film. What I saw on-screen was a very distorted/Hollywoodized version of his story with lots of unnecessary racism thrown in (because, you know, Hollywood just can't pass up the chance to bash Whitey whenever possible). Inarritu takes a simple survival story and turns it into a violent, gory revenge story. Sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism abounds. So do clichés.",2016
5,"I went into this movie with high expectations. I came out feeling like i'd just sat through a long funeral for someone I didn't know, on a hot and humid day. ",2016
6,"I haven't seen all of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films. Those I have seen were excellent or at least very good: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" and ""Birdman"".",2016
1,"It is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I assume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If you watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design, there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of showing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve an Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win it for that.",2016
5,"I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. It's good in a way and at the same time awful. To begin with, the idea to the story is interesting. It's set in the 19th century which makes the scenario more complicated than it would be today. But then there is this whole father/son scenario which really makes no sense and seems out of place. There is some back story to it that is scattered out through the film and I understand it's there to add some tension to the movie, but there is no build up to make you feel anything about it and in the end it seems boring and pointless.",2016
1,"Revenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to watch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing heavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.",2016
8,"Shot using all natural light, The Revenant is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves his first Oscar for his incredibly dedicated performance, easily the best of his career and Tom Hardy gives an Oscar worthy performance for his role as the haunting beast John Fitzgerald. The first act of the film was definitely the most impressive. With stunning visuals and flawlessly crafted intense action scenes, I felt like I was watching real footage from the 1820's! Then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in, the majority of the time it was breathtaking. But at times The Revenant got a little lost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive, it's still an unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises. It's no doubt one of the years best films.",2016
9,"OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.",2015
7,"The film is too well crafted to get the really low scores, the cinematography is too good, the acting too high caliber, the direction too solid, the score too nice, and the flick too engaging for such ratings.",2015
10,"If your willing to jump on the bandwagon and avoid this movie just because a couple of thin skinned reviewers are complaining about all the blood and all the ""n-words"", then you might as well just shovel your money into Disney's pockets and see star wars because that's the movie for you. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. If all these negative reviewers would just look past the blood and the guts, they would find a truly masterful piece of cinematic art that reflects both the expertise and effort that went into making it. The storyline is a simple one, but it's told in a complex, interesting, and relatively unique way that is guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the entire 3 hour run time of the movie. Tarantino's direction is unparalleled as usual, and the performance of the entire cast combined with the wonderful cinematography and deeply engaging dialogue make for a remarkably fun time at the theater, if your willing to sit through a lot of grisly violence and mean spirited subject matter. And although many people are complaining about the heavy political undertones of the film's storyline, to me that is one of the main components of this film that stands out the most. The plot of this film serves not only as a compelling metaphor for the racial tension amongst the American people immediately following the civil war, but actually manages to outline the visceral anger and unpredictability of the racial tension that the American people are facing today within society. In a world hell bent on purporting sensitivity and being politically correct, it's nice to see a movie that's willing to raise a middle finger to that social stigma so as to hold a mirror to the racial confrontations that are still plaguing the American people to this very day. Obviously this film is undoubtedly the most sick, twisted, and violent of Tarantino's filmography, and I'm willing to admit that it's not for everybody, but for those of you willing to toughen up, keep your trigger happy insecurities in check, and enjoy a mean, gritty, and badass film that offers no apologies for what it does best I highly recommend this film. And for those of you who are willing to let Tarantino's comments about the police force get in the way of your enjoyment of this film, like I said; Disney is more than willing to take your hard earned money.",2015
4,"This is Agatha Christie for the first two thirds, then a gore fest that tries to compensate for the lack of action in the first part, and goes overboard.",2016
8,"Even tho i was expecting more action, I've found myself at the edge of my seat at times. The characters were nicely developed. The dialogue was as expected from a Tarantino movie. The story is 3 hours long, it takes place mostly in a one single room and it's still not boring. That's something not everyone can do. All of the actors we're perfect for their roles and the acting was great as well as the character design, all of the characters were memorable and well written. The movie is divided into chapters in most of which a small twist takes place that makes you more interested in the movie. I enjoyed the film but my biggest flaws were the length and the spontaneous introduction of a narrator mid- movie, that was a pretty 'out of nowhere' lazy way to develop the back story, but oh well, Tarantino is known for making risks and doing crazy sh*t",2016
10,"This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. ",2015
7,"So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work.",2016
8,"This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.",2016
8,You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.,2016
7,"Let me start off by saying. That anyone giving this film a 1 or 2 is embarrassing themselves and anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm not saying this because I like this movie, I'm saying it because it's true. Hardly any movie in the modern era deserves this rating unless it is shameless schlock without character or plot. The Hateful 8 is not that movie. The acting alone gives this movie a 6.5 because it is so good. If you were bored by this movie, I hope you can at least admit that the people involved with this film are extremely talented. ",2016
1,"Well, that alone could be enough, but i must add something to the summary. first of all, i love (almost) every Tarantino movies. all but ""death proof"" and obviously this one. i didn't need to get as far and into the homestead, i was already bored while still riding into the forest. that's when i had ""death proof"" bad memories coming up. but i thought: ""hey, there's still two and a half hours to go, give the man a chance..."" and i did. and i regret every minute of it. and for every wasted minute (there are at least 120 of them), the angrier i did get. it was terrible. if i didn't have to wake my girlfriend up i would have been out of the cinema after 90 minutes. have you ever heard of many people falling asleep the first time they watched a Tarantino movie? but it did get worse, and then worserer, and then more, and more, and more. i don't know what the master was thinking, or doing. i won't use offensive language, although i think i am entitled to it, since i drove almost two hours to watch this, whatever it was, on the first night it was released, as i usually do with all of his movies. all i can say is: ""even the master had a bad night at the office"". we all had one of those and it can happen to anyone. only difference is that a few millions were watching... it. Mr.Tarantino will have to make amends on the next one('s), or it will loose us, the fans that made him (very rich) who he is. if by any chance anybody will read this and still go and watch this movie, let me know. i do have a dungeon that cater for you, the true masochist... cheers...",2016

The scene where Sam Jackson engages with the general, is utter rubbish, with an over the top scene in the 'throwback' the storyline could be told in about 3 minutes, but somehow, it was dragged out to nigh on 3 hours. Those who go on about cinematography, really, its a ranch, shot with a camera. i could do it as well. after 10 minutes in the ranch, you've seen all the angles, then they are done again.",2016

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big QT fan and usually enjoy the great slow, long and creative dialog in his films, but sadly the ""great and creative"" doesn't exist here. Normally I can't wait for his next film to come out, but even after seeing the trailer a couple months back I said ""uh oh, this doesn't look anywhere near up to par."" Little did I know what an understatement of epic proportions that would be.",2015
1,"This movie just goes to show what happens when a director is given totally free reign in terms of script and running time, purely on account of his name.

1,this is only the second time I have ever posted a comment on a movie the last was the birdman. now this was classed as a western and the only thing I seen was a stage ride to a cabin where the movie stayed. now this is Kurt Russell's 2nd western I have seen and the last I turned off after the first ten minutes. Now with this being a Quentin Tarantino film and the people I talked to about it said it is a typical film of his then my fault shame on me I should never have watched it but the wife wanted to hang in there and see where it went which I did and sadly went no where. Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite actors and find it totally disappointing that he needed the money that bad to do this movie. it's unfortunate that they are both heading the way of Bruce Willis just doing anything to make a buck. it took an hour and half of my life I can't get back so I am bitter. Kurt maybe think of retiring and come up to Canada with Goldie Hawn and relax at your Muskoka Lake resort and let someone turn out a good western worth watching. Sorry I am still really bitter on wasting my time,2015

1,"Until I saw this movie, I thought Quentin was a genius director and writer. After I saw this movie, I think he has never been a genius and recently he went mad trying to be one. He wants me or anyone else, disregarding the skin color that seems to be of so much importance in US, to feel sympathy for Major and see good in his actions when he is just a murderous son of a bitch with no moral code? And what is even more ridiculous that he is a friend with Lincoln and President Lincoln is more than OK with his murderous friend's feats, what's more, he supports him, praises him, says that he is a prideful son of ""black race"" and he is ought to make a change. WTH??? What kind of message is Quentin Tarantino trying to send us? In the beginning it was going smoothly, storm was building up, but then, suddenly Samuel L Jackson is talking about his huge Johnson and how he made general's son to suck it. Now, I don't even care if Jackson's character really did it or not. Even if he lied and even if the general was the worst person to ever live, Major becomes more of a piece of fecal mass than general could have ever been when he provokes father of a deceased son how he made his son suck a dick before shooting him. After this, I lost all the respect towards Samuel L Jackson as well. I know I know, it's in the script and you are an actor, but don't you have any self respect not to take a major part in such a messed up movie that isn't messed up because of its substance, but because it doesn't really have any good message to send and ends up being Weirdo Quentin's fetishes on a big screen? LIKE WTH? I could understand if this movie had a valuable point to deliver, but it doesn't have any. And Quentin, it's not like every white man has a 3 inch long dick and if they have, it doesn't necessarily mean that you should fantasize about having a bigger one in your mouth. That's just messed up my friend. This movie only promotes violence and racism. You might think I am a racist, but I am not the one who thinks blacks and whites or any other color people are of a different races. It's just ridiculous statement that has no scientific back up. Neanderthals where the different race for example. Not black or brown skinned people. For me there is no race. And what is more important, I don't care about enslaving of ""black people"" back in days. My people were enslaved as well but you don't see us crying or demanding a better life because of our ancestors who had it rough. It's just spineless and self-disrespectful thing to do. And get over with the ""n word""(Can't write an actual word because site doesn't allow it). One group of people using a word that another group of people ""aren't allowed to say""? Can you imagine any bigger obstacle in a day to day relationship than that? Anyways, Quentin, the subject of black slavery has dried out even before Django. Now it has become way more noticeable and cringe-worthy. I liked Django, even though it had some flaws of this sort, but this movie? This movie is a total garbage. I can't believe it is the same person who directed Pulp Fiction. I just can't believe it.",2015

1,"So i just spent a weekend watching every sense8 show from season 1 to the end of season 2, and it was just completely and utterly awful.",2017
9,There are few people who can make good and bad films quite as polar opposite as the Wachowski's. They made the Matrix but almost destroyed their genius reputation with the follow-up films. Now they produce a series Sens8 which I must admit crept up on me. I don't like watching or reading previews because the wait kills me when I see something I really like. Such a film is Sens8. ,2015
9,This series is riveting. watched the first six episodes back to back.,2015
10,"It's a great sci-fi story and the writing unfolds it really well, with each episode creating a build up. There's well written action, romance and intrigue within the sci-fi. The story develops mystery, but with questions still being answered answered along the way, and it created a great build up for the finale - which in itself was a great way to wrap up the first season, giving the audience a moment most would've been expecting from the beginning, while creating an 'omg what's going to happen next' impact. ",2015
1,"Although not an entirely original, or unpredictable premise, I was excited after seeing the trailers for Sense8. Well, what a total let down. ",2015
9,"I wasn't sure what to expect with S2. S1 had such a great rising action through the season but I wasn't ready to have another long slow build up. Luckily, that is not how this season is structured at all.",2017
8,"So if you are one of those people that cannot keep along in Game of thrones, then this will be particularly hard to follow through. The notch is a little bit cranked up and with a lot of characters to follow.",2015
1,"You can tell they put tons of money into this, and technically it is very appealing. But I don't understand why it has a rating of 8,4!!!! I had to fast fwd the episodes just to get through some of it. Why would they show 8 different cities in the world and then not do any research about the cultures they are portraying? So you get Korean billionaires making jokes that only USA people would make. And the entire population of Mexico City speaking English the way Americans think immigrants at the border would. I guess that's too many corporate decisions influencing the directing of the show (everyone speaking English because little kid viewers won't have interest otherwise?).",2015
10,"Comic books authors and their readers love to ask questions like ""What would happen if Batman and Superman got together and fought the same enemy (or each other)"" Sense8 is a new series that just came out on Netflix. It is asking the ultimate geek question: what would happen if you bring The Wachowski (Matrix & Cloud Atlas) together with Straczynski (who created Babylon 5) and let them make a TV series? The answer is that you get something amazingly beautiful, very detailed, often uncomfortable, with the arc that would span at least 5 seasons, and something that a half of the internet reviewers cannot make sense of.",2015
3,"This series starts off OK with episode 1. We are immediately shown a villain and our unwitting protagonists, but after that, it's just downhill. The characters are nothing but cliché. This might be OK at first, but they are never fleshed out. Other TV shows and series with good writing provide more depth to their characters after 15 minutes than this show does in 5 episodes. ",2015
10,"Sense 8 is one of the best TV shows I have seen lately. Tickling my mind, body, spirit and heart I have fallen in love and deeply care for all the characters. Sense8 is a modern, up to date and refreshingly unbiased. I am someone who throws a TV show in the trash the moment the clichés starts (""YOU LIED TO MEEE""). Sense8 did not end up in the trash. If you don't like love, you should watch this show and learn about love.",2017
1,"This show is taking the LGBT propaganda too far. Everything revolves around gays and transgender people. Come on.... I am not offended by different people, but I am offended that the creators of best sci-fi movie The Matrix made this LGBT ""sci-fi"". At least put it in the title - SenseLGBT8.",2017
10,"I love how the script is more like composed than following the doctrines that have made television predictable for so long. Also, watching the characters weave together like ripples on the surface of a water is beautiful and poetic to watch. The human connections are humane and though the characters go through darker circumstances, they keep their humanity. And the mythology of being each other's symbolic guardian angels is just excellent good television! Having to wait for season 2 will be the only negative from me. And what about the existential themes in their dialogs? There are only a handful of TV-shows, mainly J. J. Abrams', that deliver depth of emotion and meaning. I hope this type of composing of television continues. It's so rare to feel connected in the spirit with the characters and what they go through. Darkness is easy, to engage the audience in the metaphysical and in the spirit of compassion is hard.",2015
1,"I was looking for some great sci-fi to pass my time this summer and someone recommended me this title. It is rated >8 here so i started watching it. Until 3rd episode , i was patient and hopeful that story will go somewhere , but as i progressed, all i could get was more disappointment. In lieu of Sci-Fi (and its misleading IMHO) all i got to see was homosexual scenes,pointless waste of time and dubious storyline.",2015
1,I was looking forward to this and plodded through the first episode thinking it would improve but sadly it just didn't.,2015
10,"Dear Netflix, Sense8 is the finest television show ever made. Your cancellation of this show is going to have a ripple effect as thousands, perhaps millions of viewers, see that you took the easy route, the short- sighted route, and did what Fox Television did to Firefly; all you succeeded in doing is making the Sense8 community stronger by trying to disconnect us from a story line that speaks to SO many people in it's message of acceptance, perseverance, love, understanding, all wrapped up in a gorgeous cinematographic bow, and topped with the cherry of great acting. Sense8 is the finest television show ever made. The global culture of diversity is beginning to reign, despite what you may see in the news regarding the current American administration. Canada has ended a repressive leader's agenda and elected Justin Trudeau. France has made a recent change toward progressivism, and elected Emmanuel Macron as President. Ireland just elected a new prime minister, Leo Valadkar, who is both gay and from an immigrant family. If you think the world is not watching these changes, is not affected by the message of diversity, connectedness and acceptance, then you really are starting to grow ""tired"" and out of touch. Something Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, and even Mad Men can't bring you back from. Believe me when I say that Amazon and Hulu are right on your heels, and in this day and age, loyalty doesn't mean much if you don't listen *intimately* when your fans tell you something is wrong. And something IS wrong. Sense8 is the finest television show ever made. The sheer dedication to the location shoots, the detail work in the plot lines, interwoven like a gorgeous challah loaf. The effects, the lighting, gods above, the lighting alone was so breathtaking it made me gasp. I sobbed, SOBBED in Season 2 so many times, and for the first time in my life, started to look for other fans on the internet just to fully explore, to discuss, to analyze, to CELEBRATE this incredible journey. These are my people. These actors, these fans, the team who made the whole thing possible. It stands as big of a testament as Star Trek did, and look at Star Trek now! 50 years later and still going strong! Whole generations raised on the ethics, the innovation, the dream of space travel, interacting with other cultures, all led by the inimitable Lucille Ball, who Gene Rodenberry GOT HIS CHANCE FROM, because she funded it! Sense8 is the finest television show ever made. I understand there are rebuttals, and there are factors to consider that I may not be aware of. All I can tell you is, the fans think, no, they KNOW, you are wrong. Find a way to bring it back. Reach into your senses, feel the touch of your desk, listen to the ambient background noise, smell the tempting wafts from the nearest kitchen, and open your eyes to what I'm saying. We all have senses, even the most disabled of us. And with our senses, we are awash in joy, agony, terror, happiness, and contentment with our cluster. Because, if you can't tell by now, Sense8 is, the finest television show. Ever. Made.",2017
1,"I was so inspired with a news, that Wachowski started to produce these series. That much I am disappointed now. Boring, too long nothing happens, banal, primitive. The characters are flat and stilted. Russian and Indian scenes are just ludicrous. Hack.",2015
1,"Sorry I really wanted to like it but it's just awful. Cookie cutter characters that you just can't care about....The tough cop, the Asian martial artist (no stereotyping there), the African with a heart of gold that just wants to get on in life, the streetwise female DJ, the eastern European gangster and a transgender/gay character that should be groundbreaking but even she seems to be derivative....I mean wtf? That character just seems to have been shoehorned in to meet some diversity quota....Don't get me wrong there's some really great transgender characters in TV, Laverne Cox's Sophia springs to mind....But this....this is awful, terrible.",2015
1,"Sense8 is a new SciFi drama from Netflix, which got me interested by its first trailer, but also got me very disappointed halfway through the season.",2015
1,"Honestly, I think the show is just very lackluster all around. The characters simply are not interesting. I'm sure the tumblr types will love it but to me its just another botched job from the Wachowskis. It covers premium channel adult themes, but it has the writing style of a CW show. The critics don't like it because its just isn't a well executed show. They loved other LGBT shows like HBO's Looking and LGBT movie like Brokeback Mountain and Blue is the Warmest Color. Also, critics get flack for liking ""pretentious"" art-house films by the general audience...but now we are accusing them of not liking Sense8 because its too thought provoking? Please. The show just isn't that great. I think Netflix is look for its own Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad hit show and they missed the mark with this one",2015
7,"I don't know why so many negative reviews have been written about this show. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are classics and it's great to see them back working together. Eugene's son is hilarious and I find their over the top impressions of each of their characters to be spot on. The actress playing the daughter in particular is demonstrating how I see the attitude and behaviour of a lot of the young people today- shallow, vacant and self absorbed. I find this show to be clever yet silly at the same time. Read between the lines and stop expecting this to be like every other tired sitcom out there. I find this show to be very refreshing and I look forward to seeing more episodes. I have never taken the time to do a review before on IMDb but because of the negative comments I felt I had to say something as I hope people will open their minds and give it a chance.",2015
10,"A killer cast mixing vets with fresh faces, Schitt's Creek is a great new cable comedy (although it airs on network TV in Canada.) The cinematography and production design remind me of Shameless; the sharp writing and unique characters remind me of Silicon Valley. The slow and steady pace reminds me of the Christopher Guest movies that O'Hara and Levy were in. It's a rich pedigree indeed. And it doesn't disappoint. ",2015
8,"I think this show is refreshing and smart. It's a bit quirky so I can see it not being to everyone's comedic taste but I just love it. Way to go Dan and Eugene for capturing the ridiculousness of ""rich people"" reality TV when creating this sitcom. Dan Levy's character is amazing and Catherine O'Hara is great - love seeing her again! Excellent characters, good pacing and great writing. It's nice to see a hip comedy on CBC that caters to a wide age-range of viewers. I'm definitely looking forward to watching how the characters evolve and crossing my fingers that the story remains strong and that the show has another season.",2015
10,I see so much negativity about this show so felt the need to login and write a review.,2015
8,"Let's face it fellow Canucks, with the exception of a handful, most home-grown sitcoms have failed miserably. Corner Gas is probably the last one that was worth writing home about. And before that... Probably Kids in the Hall and SCTV. And when you consider that our hard- earned tax dollars have gone into the CBC trash right along with all those failed attempts, it's downright infuriating.",2015
10,"Excellent performances, I laughed out loud, worth a watch. Uh... OK I see that I must submit ten lines of text to make this review count. That's insane. Well, as a Canadian-US dual citizen, I love both countries and opt to promote the exceptional cultural contributions of both. This is the best Canadian content I've seen in a damn long time, and I'd like to make note of it. I'm normally a person of few words so I hope this pleases the IMDb review gods.oh Christ! It's still too short! Alright...Bobloblaw, Bobloblaw, Bob Loblaw, Bob Loblaw. I need two more lines. It's a good show. Can I not just say that in one line? I'm a very proud Canadian to be wasting this much GD time on a review. I see how many garbage shows survive and how many great ones fail. Check this one out.",2015
9,"I love how people dump on a series based on the first episode or two and The Canadian = crap stereotype is unfair and tiresome. This show is quickly developing its characters and by the third episode has me intrigued. If you are looking for Two and a Half Men or the like, don't waste your time. If you are a fan of the Christopher Guest movies, or Arrested Development, you will be a fan. Levy Sr. and O'Hara are at their best, and the rest of the cast which includes comedy vet Chris Elliot have delivered very promising subplots so far. It has been my first look at Daniel Levy, Annie Murphy and Emily Hampshire and all three have brought immediate depth to their characters. Subtle, ironic humour, great directing, and an excellent cast have me hooked. We need more TV like this, so give it a chance!",2015
10,"This show is hilarious - the humour is both adult and a little bit cruel - and the cast is spot on - watching the 2 old pros O'Hara and Levi working together again is such a pleasure. The writing is excellent; jokes are not telegraphed,and the laughs come as much from the delivery as from the lines themselves. The device that drives the plot is the fact that the Rose family has come down in the world with a tremendous thud and now they have to live like ordinary schmucks. This works the best when attention turns to the two young adult children in the Rose family - it- they are truly clueless and very funny to watch. To sum up, Schitt's creek features great writing and great comedy - give it a look!",2015
10,"Reading some of the negative reviews above made me question whether i was watching the same show as them. I found the show one of the better comedy productions Canadian television has put out in a LONG time. Is it everyone's cup of tea? Obviously not! Granted the premise is a bit silly and it IS over the top, but that's what made some of SCTV's skits and characters so endearing. And the writing is sharp and witty (although there are some misses here and there). Levi and O'Hara are in fine form, and the actors playing the children (one is Levi's son) play well off the parents. Add in some pretty quirky locals, and you have the makings of a pretty funny sit-com. If you were a fan of the old SCTV, chances are you'll enjoy this outing tremendously!!",2015
3,Still on the 1st season and I swear each episode gets shorter and shorter. Just watched episode 12 and I can count on one hand how many times this season has made me laugh so far.,2017
4,"To begin with, I watch a lot of comedy on TV and I feel that I know what I like and what I don't. The vast majority of N. American comedy is absolute dross. I would much rather watch 6 great episodes of a well written show from GB, New Zealand or France than 13-24 episodes of over- hyped laugh-track filled crap. That's just me. ",2017
8,"I'm a sucker for comedy, since laughing is one of the perks of life. So I decided to check this show out - new series, I didn't get my hopes up too high. The first episode had me more puzzled than smiling. With the second episode I started to get it, and I laughed out loud at tiny bits of detail that were so hilarious.",2015
8,"So, I don't usually watch the crap that CBC normally puts out there but they've finally made me laugh out loud. This show is brilliant, irreverent and funny. They've hit the nail right on the head with the Kardasian type family mixing it up with the locals in small town Canada or the US (wherever). The locals are brilliantly portrayed, from the town founders grandson to the supermarket manager to the school teacher. Lots of adult humour (bleeped out) but you get the picture. The rich family, again brilliant! Eugene Levy and Katherine O'Hara, brilliant and they really bring that smarmy Hollywood mentality alive. I can just see Paris Hilton losing her marbles after she winds up moving from a 30 room mansion to sharing a motel with her brother and getting dumped by her boyfriend (Stavros) cause she's no longer rich.",2015
8,"I love the characters....and the comedy is well written. I can't wait for the next episode. I love all the actors and the fact that 3 are Canadian (that I know of ) is a bonus. I can just imagine down the road...the possibilities are endless...the Mayor's wife is priceless.... I can't wait to watch a rich family's struggles while shacked up in a small, ugly, motel.... I'm not sure if the son plays a gay man, and I think they should make that more clear in the next episodes. I would like to see more of the town, and restaurant scenes....ultimately even though we have a dislike of snobs I find it hard to dislike the Roses. Their pathetic disposition and apparent snooty is likable.",2015
10,I totally love this show! ,2015
1,"A friend who rarely recommends TV shows, recommended Schitt's Creek, so I was eager to give it a try. I can suspend disbelief when watching TV or a movie, but I appreciate people acting plausibly. Nobody in Schitt's Creek acts like a real person. Everybody is an ignorant stereotype. The ex-rich Rose family don't act like any rich or successful people I've ever met. In the first episode, Eugene Levy's character, Johnny Rose, is unable to explain to an earthy townie that the family needs time to unpack. Rose is supposed to be a rich video store magnate. He should have some ability to get people to do things. The rest are all neurotic, selfish and self-absorbed. None have any charisma or interpersonal skills. The townies are drawn just as poorly. They seem to be dense and limited, living desperate lives. The actors are generally talented, but the writers really seem to hate people.",2017
3,There was nothing resembling a good joke in the pilot episode and everything was as predictable as yesterday's weather. Rich family thrown out of their mansion yet they own an entire small town? I don't get it. The show is like a bad episode of Green Acres and they were all bad. So we begin with a tired premise and from there we are given stock characters without a trace of humor or originality and then there is the fact that the writing is amateurish. One of the gags in the first episode is the doors are taken off their motel rooms. I don't get it. How is that funny? Don't answer that because I already know the answer: it isn't funny. The two children are completely annoying which isn't synonymous with funny. Toilet humor rears its ugly head early on. Comedy has gone to this little town to die.,2016
10,Second episode was even better than the first! I'm hooked.,2015
7,"I was cheering for show despite the fact that, unlike sketch comedy shows like SCTV and Kids in the Hall, and radio shows like The Irrelevant Show, Canadian sitcoms have tended to fall flat on their faces. The first episode started off little better than the typical committee-produced Hollywood sitcom, without a lot of laughs. But it grew on me by the second episode with its low-key quirky humour (somewhat disguised by the lack of a laugh track). Eugene Levy is a fine form as a fish out of water, and fellow SCTV alum Catherine O'Hara is effective (though a bit strident) as his freaked-out wife. Emily Hampshire is especially good as the grounded motel ""concierge,"" playing off the stridency of the Rose family. With some good direction and writing, and a focus on keeping this an ensemble piece (and a reigning in the broader acting of the junior Roses), Schitt's Creek could morph into a Canadian Arrested Development. We'll see.",2015
1,I'm not sure where all of these glowing positive reviews and ratings are coming from. Are we watching completely different shows or is this some kind of vote rigging where these votes have been purchased? Or maybe are the cast and crew of this show voting again and again to drag this show up?,2015
1,First of all how does this show get higher than 7 out of 10 on this page and that many votes? I suspect serious Frank D'Angelo level vote tampering and ballot box stuffing if that is that case because I can't think of one single real life person who has seen this show and not hated it.,2016
1,"How can anyone as talented as Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara turn out such infantile, irritating and unfunny garbage? How anyone can consider this show even remotely funny and give it the ratings that they do speaks volumes about the (abysmally low) average intelligence level of the few remaining people who watch live television. Apparently annoying and stupid people are what's considered funny these day ala 'Jackass' from MTV and every Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott movie ever made. And whoever told Chris Elliott that he was EVER funny - or even one tenth the comedian that his father was - was an idiot. Were I a Canadian taxpayer I would be screaming for whatever portion of my money went to finance this schitt.",2015
1,Schitt's Creek is just a bad show. I'm pretty insulted actually that CBC is giving it another season when everything I read says that the ratings crashed down to almost nothing and it must cost a lot of money to get these big name actors. Renewing a show before it even started airing is just stupid isn't it?,2015
2,"I'm not trashing this show out of hate or bias. I'm trashing this show because it is absolute garbage. The fish out of water premise works and can be funny, but not with this show. The writing kills Schitt's Creek. The jokes are totally unfunny and fall flat. What makes this worse is that the audience sees where the writers are trying to make a joke hit but they all ultimately fall flat. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes. This could work in a true satire but this is not one. ",2017
10,"Honestly, I throughly enjoyed watching the first three episodes of this show. The jokes were funny, the visual humor was great, and the acting is at minimum, decent. The show itself is a funny concept. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of this show. In my mind, it's the best new comedy I've seen on TV all season. ",2015
9,"Just when you miss Park and Recreation, and the Office is long over - comes Superstore; another look into an exaggerated part of the American Culture. It's an obvious mock on Walmart / Target style stores (With coloring similar to Walmart), and over the top characters that we may grow to love (If the network doesn't cancel it next week that is). Hopefully this show will pull the much needed ratings to stay alive for a few seasons to gain a following.",2015
10,"I disagree completely that the plot is underdeveloped, and the characters might be somewhat cliché, but that's the idea. In my opinion this is what every story with a message does. It takes archetypes as representatives of all people in a society and shows their reactions, no one would say that Breakfast Club is clichéd because it plays with the archetypes to convey the message. And Superstore does the same, it shows prejudice, narrow-mindedness (from poor to educated and the other way round, both sides!!)wrongly understood sense of love or duty etc. etc., in short: all the topics that emerge between people at a workplace or in society and it does this very cleverly, very holistically and most of all: with a lot of great and refreshing humor -and without mocking its characters - great fun with sensitivity and a message, perfect entertainment, 10 points!",2016
9,"I don't usually like anything new, so not sure why I decided to give this program a try. I know nothing about it going in. In fact, I may have thought this was a different show than it was. Isn't/wasn't there some other show about a big box store that had a freaky stoner looking guy in it? I wasn't interested in *that* one, so like I said, it was a rare happenstance that I lingered on my local NBC station for this.",2015
8,"My biggest worry about this show is that people are going to write it off before watching it. If you look at the characters working at the store - one Latina, one gay Asian, one clueless white trash pregnant girl, one disabled black guy, one new Jewish guy, and one really weird guy - it may seem more like they just assembled a group covering every demographic (I am sure a South Asian Muslim will be introduced before we know it!). ",2015
10,"It's the perfect 20 min show. It reminds me of The Office (US) quite a bit. By ""a bit"" I mean a lot. (Which is probably why I adore this show so much. If you enjoy The Office, you will definitely like this show. Once you are a couple episodes in, it gets really good. A handful of the characters' attributes on Superstore is influenced by those in The Office. (You will definitely see the resemblance if you watch.) So if you are still reminiscing the show (The Office), Superstore will satisfy your need. (Although it is not filmed documentary style.) America Ferrera and Ben Feldman have a great connection on screen.",2016
8,"The more I watch it, the more I like it. The characters are all progressively more defined and interesting and they all mesh well together. Anyone who's ever worked in the service industry might feel nostalgic watching it-- crappy corporate jobs bring the little guys together and you become a family without even realizing it. This show is an inside look on that. It's fun for the whole family to watch and the jokes are always fresh. Definitely recommend it.",2017
10,"I just watched the first two episodes, and I laughed out loud!! Sure, many of the jokes might be stereotypical, but it's all about the delivery, and the delivery is very smart! Also, I'm already very intrigued about Amy's back story, seems interesting! I think I'm hooked, can't wait for the next episodes to air. ",2016
1,"This show could have been entertaining like Outsourced was for customer service, Scrubs was for hospitals, and Dear John for support groups. Instead, the writers seemed to make a concerted effort to cobble together every single possible negative stereotype associated with working not just in retail, but in a place that makes Wal*Mart seem like Neiman Marcus in comparison.",2016
2,"first off out aside of the main characters, the vast majority of gags are random customers doing strange stuff (mostly when they can't of a way to end a scene, it'll just cut to this) but where this show fails the most is the characters Amy- the show treats her as the only sane/responsible employee, despite the fact that Amy is usually as irresponsible/bad at her job than everyone else who works at could9 along with her character being so thin skinned that she gets offended when Jonah calls her ""responsible"" and the forced with her and Jonah just comes off as us being a vanity project for America Ferrera Jonah- stereo typical intellectual college grad, after supposedly ""pretentious"" because he has a college degree and Actually tries to help people, outside of that his character is a blend paint by the numbers pretty boy, who's only reason for him act bizarrely out of character is to move plot along",2016
10,"I absolutely think this is one of the funniest shows on TV. Its humor is totally well written. As soon as the next episode comes out, I get all excited. It just takes me into many laugh-out-loud moments, one right after another. Someone is a great comedy writer here. As you get to know the characters, you end up really liking them. It all borders on real-life stuff, but exaggerated. Record it...watch it...and laugh. You'll love it! My kind of humor. I don't like just any humor...but this is my kind. Knee slapping funny. For the folks that don't like this, I think you are a rare commodity and you just have a different idea of what humor is. Majority of the people will love it and we need this to take us away from our daily frustrations of the real world. OK...I can't wait for next weeks episode. I also like Dr. Ken and The Last Man on Earth, but I think this one is at the top of the list. All very funny.",2016
2,"Stereotypes, clichés, and bad writing. The show has the retro look and feel of the 2007 premier episodes of Chuck. It's even going to air in the same time slot. It doesn't help that Ben Feldman looks and acts so much like Scott Baio did back in the day that it's giving me flashbacks. So how could anyone compare this show to The Office? It may have Justin Spitzer but it's missing something else. And I was shocked to see America Ferrera in this. Is she that hard up for work? NBC has already given it a vote of no confidence, cutting its order from the original 13 episodes down to 11. If you're enjoying shopping cart kayaking in the parking lot, watch it now because if it keeps depending on Jonah knocking down aisle displays for laughs, it won't be back next season.",2015
3,"A good cast does what they can with some of the worst writing we've seen on TV in ages. Clichés, stereotypes and 1 dimensional characters fill what could have been a good premise if the writers had just dialed it back a little and gone for characters approaching believable. ",2015
1,I agree with much of what was said in FastPuppy's review.,2015
4,"It's with a heavy heart that I write this review. As a fan of NBC's past workplace comedies along with actors Ben Feldman (thanks to ""A to Z"") and America Ferrera (Ugly Betty) it seemed on paper this was going to be my new favorite show. It had so much potential being set in a big box superstore. NBC has made a lot of really excellent workplace comedies. I'm talking The Office, Parks and Recration, Outsourced and hey even Community could be described this way. Instead what I got was often just raunchy potty humor or just mindless jokes with some of the worst writing that no good actor could make up for.",2016
1,"The only funny thing I found about this dreadful series.. -was that the Screenwriters were actually paid for such rubbish. The story lines were appalling and the jokes even worse. I watched 3 episodes to give it a chance in the hope it would improve - It did not, it actually got worse. I couldn't even finish watching ep3, it was that bad. The sad thing about it was that some of the actors were quite good and talented. I feel sorry for them. I agree with a previous honest review, it will not be back for Season 2 and I am not surprised the network cut the number of episodes to be shown.. I rarely post reviews as I believe viewers should decide for themselves. Only for really bad TV Shows and Movies do I do so.. in this case that criteria applies.",2015
2,"How this dog of a series has lasted as long as it has is totally beyond me. Then again, idiotic shows like Big Brother, The Bachelor, or The Bachelorette just keep going and going and going.",2016
8,"Unlike a lot of other good shows which become good over time, this show starts of with a bang. The first episode itself is quite a charm and the hope is that they keep up the good work. It's funny, some characters are fun and interesting, others not so much, so hopefully they can make the characters more unique and comical. The ensemble is to the point, but I think it'll take a little more time for the characters to grow on the viewers. ",2016
1,"DULL, RACIST, and incredibly NOT funny. This show is so painfully bad NBC needs to give out aspirin to the viewers. ",2016
9,"Was looking for a show to watch with my husband and we were laughing the entire time! Saw three epsiodes so far and can't wait to watch more.sometimes shows are not actually funny and you kinda have to force laughs but this was very funny.I really like the whole cast and they all do a great job with delivery and acting . Another plus in the show is the diversity.all the characters are different races and very different personalities.you will also be able to relate to this show if you have worked retail before!!! IT IS NOT stereotypical humor like another reviewer put ,its creative .stereotypical to me is that awful show empire. or any joke on a Seth rogen movie !! Reference the racist overused jokes on sausage party .anyways this shows awesome.",2016
6,"This show borrows its format from the British series ""Trollied"", focusing on the shenanigans of employees of a fictional department store/supermarket. There are some genuine laugh out loud moments - the Dina character gets a lot of the best lines, but the main two characters Amy & Jonah are a little bit clichéd. The writers force- feed the audience the basic set up in the first 2 minutes where it's obvious that long time employee Amy will be the love interest of new starter Jonah. From there all the other fringe characters are introduced with their overly exaggerated quirks (the creepy one, the gay one, the white trash one, the dedicated one etc etc). It's not terrible, some characters have funny moments, but ultimately ít always comes back to the schmaltzy main story arc of when will Amy & Jonah get together. Nothing groundbreaking here 6/10.",2015
9,"I have to start with this... It isn't a serious or avant-garde. Much like My Name Is Earl and Parks, it is the little things that make. The absurd nature of it. ",2017
6,"I will preface this by saying that Superstore is not a bad show, it's actually a decent modern sitcom. At the same time one cannot help but to compare Superstore to other popular modern sitcoms. There are obvious parallels to the Office found in this show, even sharing some writers/producers. The biggest difference is that Superstore just isn't consistently funny. It's obvious that Amy and Jonah are similar to Pam and Jim; both are lovable characters, but Amy is a in a relationship while Jonah has feelings for her. Dina is Dwight, the strong willed co worker that is just a bid different that other people. Whilst the comparisons are obvious, I actually like all three of these characters. Being similar to a show like The Office is okay if the characters are charming and the jokes are funny. This leads to Glenn, the worst part of this show. Glenn is not funny, he's Michael Scott if Michael Scott was not funny. It's not the actor's fault, I just don't think he's given any material to work with. He's the trope of the religious man that is just a bit too innocent for the world. I'm not saying that tropes are bad, they're bad when they're not funny. The issue of Glenn also leads into Superstore's biggest flaw, wasted potential. This is a sitcom in the style of The Office, Parks and Rec, Arrested Development and many others, set in a fictional Walmart. There is so much to work with, and instead they just regurgitated the Jim and Pam romance and focus on the relationships between the workers as opposed to the relationship with their coworkers along with their surroundings. These sorts of relationships work in shows like Parks and Rec because they're in an office, they only have each other to talk to. In a Superstore interactions with customers and the crap that retail workers go through should have been a central point to the show. In the end, I'll still watch it and hope it gets better. Superstore is not bad, it could just be so much better.",2017
8,"Like all ""sit-coms"" and any TV series, it often misses the mark entirely. A recent example was ""Cheyenne's Wedding"". Some of the jokes were downright cruel and tasteless. Also, it should have been held at the store for maximum humor. No classic show is immune from clunkers. Remember all the bad episodes from all of ""Star Trek"" TV? Grinding out a show every week can't be easy. The premise for the show is loosely-based on the decade-old Jessica Simpson movie ""Employee of the Month"". Why did it take so long to become a series? It is a natural. Anyone who has had the ""pleasure"" of having a retail ""grunt"" job knows all about it, including the odd, strange, and obnoxious co-workers and customers that populate the retail universe. Most of my supervisors were as ""clueless"" as the management running ""Cloud 9"". I am not sure where they film it now, but it was originally inside a Costco at one time. Look for ""Kirkland"" products on the shelves.",2017
9,Wow! I usually doesn't like comedies but Superstore kills it in this department. I can't quite compare it to Friends since it is so much different.,2016
10,"This is a must see. The writing, the acting, the cast, are all perfect. It is so rare that you find a show with such a diverse cast coming together so seamlessly. Each character is perfectly cast. The writing allows you to live each chactors journey throughout each scene. You do not know who's side you are on; all you know is they are all ""right"" in their convictions in some way. The tension and life within this show makes you feel it as though you are there. Re- watch to find details you may have missed the first time. It is a thriller, drama, comedy, tragedy, and fairytale all in one. Watch the show to find out which character resonates with you ethics and morals. The lines may be harder to see than you think. The cast are living their roles and their conviction is riveting. Thank you for this show.",2016
10,"I love both leads in the show, Giamatti and Lewis are both amazing on their roles, both characters are I want to WIN ALL THE WAY but are broken inside with flaws they both depend on the same woman to try to repair. Imagine you get a TV show about The Wolf of Wall Street, with less profanity (I have nothing against, by the way) and mix it up with and equal opposite as the guy after him, both with money both with power but a big difference, the billionaire came from noting , rise up from a poor kid to the top. and the Public Officer (district attorney) is the one that grow up with money and power but have a hunger to be successful bringing down white collar guys.",2016

10,"Great show (judging from first episode). You can always tell its going to be a good show when the things you remember the most are the characters. The law drama, insider trading, sex, etc make the show interesting but Chuck, Bobby and Wendy make it captivating. I think Wendy will basically be the deciding factor of who will ultimately come out on top (either Chuck or Bobby) and it will be interesting to see which way she will lean.",2016
9,"""Billions"" is fantastic as it plays with your emotions as you are unsure of who to root for as both the main characters, Bobby and Chuck are likable however they both do things that make you say ""Why did you do that!?"" but this is the reason the show is fantastic! Damien Lewis and Paul Giamatti bring the characters to life and I could not imagine any other actors in these roles and will be one of the leading reasons this show will continue to be successful! The writing is also exceptionally good and the writers really help to make the characters personalities and intentions known. In all, I believe ""Billions"" will be successful and if the writers can continue to keep up the good work, we will have plenty of seasons in the future.",2016
9,"Completed watching two episodes of this show and I am all of praise for it. It contains features that excite me to go for a show like insider trading, corporate politics, courtroom scenes and complex characters. It is kind of on the same lines as Suits but an incremented version of it. The pilot starts with building of the two lead characters Chuck and Bobby while keeping up the tempo too. Between the two you cannot decide whom to root for as both have gray shades.",2016
10,"Based on the writing and characterizations alone, this show, right out of the box, would be a 9.",2016
5,"Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, so let me just get that out of the way. He could basically stand there and read the phone book and it would be entertaining. Even his small role in Downton Abbey seemed like it was etched into the storyline; everything he does is believable. As for the rest of this series, well, I'm six episodes into the first season and the main problem I have with this show is that it doesn't seem realistic. Don't tell me that Axelrod is a brilliant man, show me. I had to turn it off when Axe was standing on a desk trying to pump up his troops with a canned speech; it came off as phony. I have to admit that I don't understand a lot of the industry terms, so leaving me scratching my head is probably a step in the right direction, but the show lost me when Axe returns to the office after his sabbatical and Wagner stands there and says ""you planned this, didn't you?"" Again, show me, don't tell me. A perfectly good moment ruined by bad directing.",2017
9,"BILLIONS (SHO): It's all a game of cat and mouse, or who has the biggest set of balls in this story of conflict between two very powerful men. The first is Bobby (Axe) Axelrod, the only surviving partner of Axe Capital hedge fund who just happened to be out of the office on 9/11. Damien Lewis gives us a multifaceted character who has enormous wealth which was probably earned illegally via insider trading. This guy's got it all: beautiful, loving wife, great kids, lives in a mansion with a full time chef and can buy anybody and does. He's so wealthy, he can go to the finest restaurants in a T-shirt. The second is the US Attorney, Chuck Rhoades played by an intense Paul Giamatti who is determined to take Axe down. Their common bond is Rhoades' wife, Wendy, (the very cool and very appealing Maggie Siff) a brilliant psychiatrist who works for Bobby as the in-house shrink, performance coach and cheerleader for the high pressure account execs who have self-doubt and are desperately trying to stay ahead of the game and earn Axe's approval because they fear replacement if they don't perform. She's been working with Bobby even before she met Chuck and makes tenfold what he makes. As a result, the Rhoades' have huge conflict of interest issues which prevents them from talking about work. Wendy loves her husband but is extremely loyal to Axe. Then there's the added bonus of the Rhoades' 50 Shades of Grey dominant/submissive sex play. Chuck is masochistic who likes to be tied up. The machinations of the financial world are as complicated as they are exciting and the writers have given us an intelligent show, smartly done. (See what I did there?) Score: 9. WATCH IT. Bonds and Bondage, can't miss.",2016
10,"The only thing disappointing about this show is the fact that our government isn't going after Wall Street criminals as depicted in this great new series. The cast is stellar, the dialogue is top-notch, the story is complicated, and it is completely free of clichés. There are no cartoon villains in this story, something that is almost impossible to pull off in a feature film because there just isn't enough time.

There is a DA who wants to nail them, especially the main character named Axelrod.

3,"This show seems to be about how effectively ruthless ultra rich people are. Another part of its appeal is probably the viewers' wish to be as rich themselves and to be able to stick it to other people. The story evolves around people power gaming each other. Don't expect any sophisticated plots or unanticipated turn of events. The characters are one dimensional as those in a cartoon: They have one character trait and motivation and that's it. Real people have competing motivations and drives. People who are unkind to others are not simply evil, they act the way they do because of their world view. The characters in ""Billions"" are not real, they are artificial and predictable as the story.",2017

2,"great actors...should have followed the ""Big Short"" style on reality. seems like they tried to dumb it down way too much. It would be like equating Gordon Gekko with Martha Stewart. In reality, Damian Lewis' hedge fund would have been out of business after one year. His insight were at most banal. I hoped this would be the next great drama, but it was reduced to insider trading 101. Sort of like doing a drama on AIDS, and saying it is transmitted by toilet seats.

The acting is good and the production values are excellent, as the crew did a superb job of bringing to life an alternate 1962 America. But perhaps Frank Spotnitz's greatest success is in his management of the source material, as his script remains pretty faithful to PKD's novel within the parameters of a 1-hour pilot. I would love to see Amazon make this a series, not only to see how Spotnitz and his team adapt the rest of the novel, but also to see where they might take it in seasons to come.",2015

1,"I was really interested in the subjects, Germans winning the war and how the world would develop. But besides the ""they nuked washington"", ""we burn our cripples on tuesday"" and the son of the obersturmführer in for euthanasia, the rest was just terrible. The characters made only stupid moves, like why not kill the marshal when they had a chance, why didn't the marshal kill the nazi agent? THen the chances. The boring girl meets the nazi agent in the 10 story nazi headquarter, where she can walk around freely.. tons and tons of stupidiy. Whats even frustrating: they start to develop characters, but then they are gone. So many loose ends.",2016
2,"The pilot episode is solid, and the production values are very high. And although this might be enough to hook some people, the first three episodes are riddled with moments of terrible writing, acting or both, that grow more frequent along the way, culminating in episode 3's The Marshall character, which is laughably atrocious melodrama and seems to come from another show entirely. It's as if a generation of superhero movies (good and bad) have primed the audience/filmmakers to a point where a show with this high of a budget would dare try a character this ridiculous, and in a show that wasn't supposed to be 'camp'.",2015

It is visually impeccable, great cinematography and CG and art direction, script is pretty close to the original book, excellent pacing, very good acting... characters at this point are not too deep but this is a one-hour pilot, it supposed to tease us, not reveal everything, let alone (correctly) focusing on story development right now, not character development (which inherently requires a few episodes.)

Oh, sorry, that's real life: What I meant is; well you know, the Nazis got the A-bomb first and won WWII. So we get the usual hacked-to-death Nazi Resistance shtick set in the Mad Men universe. Thing was, Mad Men didn't start out a nostalgic soap opera, it was a gripping character study to begin with.

Nothing has ever been made to the scale of this show, that depicts what the world would be like (in the 60's) if the Nazis would have won WW2. It is high budget, story and visually driven, combining visuals that rival those of modern films, and a plot which we can only guess at. (unless you have read the book(s)). The acting is very good- for those who don't know the lead actress was in The Chronicles of Riddick, and one of the men ""we"" meet is from Supernatural. If you like Hunger Games, GoT, Legends, Vikings or any of these shows, you will like this. I highly recommend watching this, to everyone. Watch it!",2015

5,"The Man in the High Castle has a plot that seems very promising on paper, but fails to deliver. The first episode occurs across several cities in North America which, despite the extreme improbability, all happen to be cloudy and rainy. The scenes and conversations are terse and lack any detail whatsoever. Character development is bland at best, even for a single episode. ",2015
7,"What is ostensibly Amazon's attempt at developing its own 'House of  Cards' provides an intriguing backdrop with a promising but somewhat-  shaky implementation. The show, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick,  is one of five pilots that Amazon is promoting for a potential run at a  full 2015 season.   Right from the start, the show stays close to its source material in  both plot and setting. While following the book certainly has its  merits, the script so far lacks in its portrayal of the characters'  psychological intricacies and in several cases comes across as  heavy-handed. For example, in this episode we learn (and are reminded  of) how evil the Nazis are through generic torture scenes and murder--  typical ""bad guy"" stuff. I don't recall the text depicting any accounts  of Nazi violence to this extent, but rather their presence loomed on  all characters due to the claustrophobic effects of their propaganda  and fascist scheming.   The acting was competent but the script felt oddly-paced, in particular  it seemed that not much thought had been given to the character Joe  Blake (he did not exist in the book) as he didn't really convey any  emotional or logical motivation for wanting to become a political  dissident besides hoping to ""do the right thing"". That being said, the  characters Nobusuke Tagomi and Juliana Crain were especially brought to  life in this adaptation.  Based on the direction of the pilot, I fear that the show may attempt  to play-up the ""American resistance"" theme which is irrelevant and  antithetical to one of the major messages of the book. What was  intended as a commentary on paranoid diplomacy in a totalitarian world  could all too easily become a trite Star Wars- style action/adventure  series. On the other hand, one cannot expect fully fleshed-out  characters in the pilot episode so it will take some more time to  fairly judge the writing quality.   I am cautiously optimistic about this show's future-- for a pilot it  certainly succeeded in establishing an alluring setting, and I was not  surprised to learn that Ridley Scott was involved as the set- design  and ambiance was superb. Overall, I am excited to see if this will  manage to thrive alongside both the classic novel and other  contemporary political-drama TV shows.",2015

I decided to squeeze in the pilot. Needless to say, 7 episodes later I was still watching. The story line is incredible. The acting is great. The emotions that it brought out of me was real and raw. It made me appreciate and think differently about the word/idea/concept that we all throw around ""FREEDOM.""

I am definitely not gonna watch season 3, I've bought the book instead; Philip Dick's writing and ideas never disappoint me. The writer of the series seems to confuse guerrilla wars with the Nazi war, and wants to equalize fighting for your freedom with holocaust, fascism and racism.

The new characters are compelling, especially Rufus Sewell's portrayal of Obergruppenfuhrer John Smith. I have a strong feeling Philip K. Dick would have liked this series... And Mr. Tagomi and Juliana are just as I've always imagined them through 6 or 7 readings of the book.

A set of circumstances that evolve in an amusing way. I can't think of a show like it. Looking back over the negative reviews here I find myself wondering if that is something to be proud of.

I am guessing the budget only covered two cars and 9 fish tanks. The water thing threw me off. Unless you have a well water comes from that huge tower and works when there is no electricity. Unless it leaked out he would have a lifetime supply, if it ran out then move to the next town. Even zombie movies have running water. Speaking of where are the dead people and traffic jams? I would have picked aliens vs a virus to explain why the earth was so clean. More important than the stuff that is wrong is the lack of him doing much of anything.

I can only guess that the negative reviews were from people who possess one of the follow attributes: lacks a sense of humor, doesn't appreciate an original plot, does not like to be immersed in a show, does not watch enough of a show to truly judge it. This show allows me to fantasize about how it would be to do things that we can't do in real life. When there are so few people in the world you can just drive to a city or town and move into the house of your choice, go to a liquor store and grab what you want, go to a movie theater and turn on the projector and watch a movie all by yourself, help yourself to some candy and popcorn...provided you have been handy enough to get some electricity going...not hard to hook up some solar panels though.",2015

Again, unfortunately, the additional character makes it so much worse. I was hoping the main character would've thrown her out of the car, the instant complained about stop signs.

1,"The fact that anyone would rate this better than one star has me seriously fearful for the survival of this race. There was absolutely nothing new or funny about this show. Unless their attempt at comedy was to bring out every single cliché, every tired trope that had ever been done about the genre, then I don't see the point of even making this.",2015
1,"Terribly unoriginal and unfunny writing. Phil Miller hates life, he acts like a jerk, he somehow redeems himself only for someone or something to screw it all up so he hates life again - rinse and repeat for every episode so far. ",2015
1,I have tried so very hard to like this show. I have watched the first two episodes and the 11th and 12th episodes. One of the main problems with this show is the lack of direction the characters have. They are all written flat and none of them have any personality. The characters are lazy and have no depth.,2015
1,So not funny and so typical of a society in serious decline under the stewardship of the cancer known as LIBERALISM. This is a sad day for comedy and an even sadder day for the image that these Hollywood morons want to impose on our society. What in the name of anything were these fools thinking when they funded this garbage. No way should this ever become more than a a mistake in the overall pathetic production line of modern TV land. If people find this stuff funny then I am seriously worried about them. The nature of life is so much more than what they assume and I am very ticked off that this is even airing. OK Enough said. Just do not want to waste more time on this stuff. Geeezzzzzzzzzzzz!,2015
1,"Simply as that: Watch it only if you find humorously to discuss it ALL the time about: - how you poop in a pool/ fountain, - how you masturbate/ why/ how often, - how you can drink spirit from a small swimming pool that you are in, dressed like a hobo, - how smelly you are when you don't shower for days, - how to fit/ fix water pipes with duck-tape (really?), and how to read in a book about this ""method"" (really? - again), - poop, - masturbation (Yeah, again), - non-hygienic sex, smelly genitalia.",2015
1,"I had very high hopes for this series, after the first couple of episodes it looked like it might be something good to watch. As they developed the main character, Phil, he turns out to be a lying, self serving loser, that really cares for nobody but himself. I read another review where they compared him to Gilligan, but Gilligan's gaffs were good natured, best intentions gone awry. Phil is like an evil Gilligan, where evil intentions go awry. He's always out for himself at the expense of others. It's hard to watch a show where you despise the main character and he has no redeeming qualities. After watching a few episodes, you can boil the show down to the following formula: 1. Phil hatches a plot to get some advantage for himself by being mean, deceitful, inconsiderate, etc. 2. Phil Get's caught in his game. 3. Cliffhanger ending to see what will be his punishment",2015
1,"Reviewers who see this show as brilliant like to say that people who don't like it just have no sense of humor, or don't get the fact that we're supposed to hate Phil. The humor derives from how despicable he is and how cringe-worthy his actions are. I get that. And I've suffered through many episodes (8, but it feels like more) so I'm not judging it on the first episode or something.",2015
1,"I cant believe that this show has such a high rating. People you can judge for yourself from all the 1 star consumer reviews this show has. All the major reviews have to be paid for by fox. This show is absolute drivel! you have Phil the main character who is just extremely unlikeable in every single way possible. How can you make a main character so unlikeable? Its uncanny! I kept watching this show in hopes of it getting better but every episode just got worse and worse, I did not think it was possible.",2015
1,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** I've watched 2 shows thus far, and I know virtually nothing about the main character, or the situation. Character development is extremely important in a story. . .it gives you the motivation to care about what happens to the main character. So not only do I know nothing about the background of the main character, what little personal traits I have seen of his activities leaves me liking him even less. He's unintelligent (stupid), disorganized, and unhygienic (slovenly). For an apocalypse, I haven't seen one dead body, nor have I heard anything about the disease. ",2015
3,"So, in general I enjoyed the first episode of this series, though it was a bit slow to begin with.",2015
3,"The show started OK. The last man on Earth - Phil is very pleased blowing things up and taking a margarita bath. Nothing really funny happens but it's not bad. There is hope it will get better. And it does get better! Enter Carol. She is easily the funniest character on the show and she has a major role in the second hour. She insists that Phil stops at a stop sign even though there are no other cars. She want to repopulate with Phil but only after they get married. She makes funny(absurd) corrections to Phil's English. I'd actually give the second hour 8 stars. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. The show quickly deteriorates to complete waste of time. Melissa shows up and Carol's character is showed to the background. The show becomes Phil running after Melissa like a dog, trying to score with her. It's not funny at all. In fact, it's anti-funny. Finally to top it off, Tod shows up and that pretty much puts the final touch on the show for me, since Phil is not even the last man on Earth any more.",2015
1,"The main character is so over the top, its almost embarrassing. I literally have to turn a way at times, he is so crazy. Not crazy funny, crazy bad over the top acting. The main character so over acts, you would swear the actor is the one paying for the show. I don't mind the silly story line. The main actor, just can't take it. I tried! Watched a complete episode and a half. I smiled but mostly felt embarrassed at that bad acting of the main character. The show seemed to have promise. I liked the story idea. The script isn't bad and the two lady characters are good. The acting by the woman, I have no issues with. To be honest I wanted the show to work. Waste of time.",2015
1,"This show had so much potential, if i was the last man on earth i may go around the country(maybe around the world) go to Museums, Amusement parks, show lil bit of personal struggle, sneak into air craft carrier, shoot random stuff with a machine gun and all these can make a good TV show. and when you see the trailers you think you gonna get to see some of stuff i mentioned but you not gonna get any of that.",2015
9,"The last man is a drunken porn obsessed bozo and the last woman is an organized law-abiding neat freak. Thus, yet again, men are sloppy pigs and can't survive without the strength of a woman. Even their logic is flawed. If you've already messed up and trashed a mansion there is no need to clean it in an effort to straighten out your life. Just move to a new clean one for a fresh start. If you have access to the entire country but there no electricity why pick Tuscon with no AC? Even if it is your home town you know what it's like. Yes, I watched the entirety of the 2 premier episodes. I kept hoping it'd get better and wondered when the comedy would start. I'll probably watch one more but 3 strikes and you're out.",2015
1,"Very bad writing. In fact it's so bad that I can't help feeling perplexed at how in god's name the writers of this show got to be writers in the first place, let alone on such a big franchise. The characters are parodies of themselves, making decisions no one in their right mind would make, be it in a zombie apocalypse or otherwise.",2016
1,"Wow, an extended first episode with hardly any action and a lot of bad acting. None of the characters are particularly redeeming. Having read the spoilers ahead of time that this was going to be the apocalyptic Brady Bunch I had reservations and they were warranted. It is actually the anti-Brady Bunch. Other than the mother and step-father (demonstrating unrealistic teenage love) the rest of the 'family' aka kids are just stereotypical dweebs. Mother's daughter doesn't like SF because Mom dated too many men, for some unknown reason the older son is a heroin addict living in a crack church and SF's son is disgruntled with his father and step-siblings and avoids his visitation weekends. Not original at all. I'm sure the point is to show how cohesive they become once the zombies take over. That is how predictable all of the writing is.",2015
1,"I think this show could be so amazing conceptually, but the approach thus far is way off. Cutting through the fat, to the bare bones if you pardon my zombism: Fans of TWD already know what to expect- we are here for the ride, to fill in that big blank of how the world goes down into a flesh-feasting apocalypse... Instead we are treated to slightly over an hour's worth of dry, static characters brooding over their broken family, and the search (both literally and in a more metaphoric sense), for their son- a confused junkie who- I'll be honest- is the one character I personally want to see get eaten more than anyone else so far on this show. I understand the need for character development, especially when beginning a new show- however I also feel if it's done well and proper- you shouldn't feel it- you shouldn't even necessarily notice it- it should happen organically. What I figure to be no more than time-filler is the need to return to ""scene of the crime"" two additional times after the opening act- a dimly lit church turned drug den (for a similar scene done much better, see 28 Days Later). Ultimately this serves as a cheap tension builder with no real payoff either time. The decisions the main characters make not to involve police even after discovering blood and guts galore add to the plot holes involving the zombies themselves, and how no one seems to be noticing them sooner... Or the lack of emotion or reaction from the main characters when they do encounter the undeniable truth. In all this series looks to have potential down the road, but if it follows the formula of the pilot episode, the writers are going to make you earn every methodical moment of it, and request a more than reasonable suspension of disbelief when it comes to bad decisions, implausible reactions, and an acceptance of irritating characters. FTWD thus far has not enriched the Walking Dead universe; it banks on fans' devotion to it to remain seated through the journey to the grueling end, or at least, through the second season.",2015
1,"I can't remember a group of lead characters that were so painfully boring, one dimensional, and unlikable. Their collective stupidity is so hard to watch, it makes me wonder how show runners from TWD could've created this mess. The teenage angst ridden kids have to go, why would I waste an hour watching some clueless, bratty kids? The soldiers are right; weed out the sick and weak, contain the disease. That's the end of the story line for that show, instead our ""lead characters"" keep screwing it up. If these idiots would stop getting in their way, maybe the soldiers could contain the disease. That would obviously nullify the Walking Dead, so I guess they can't change the plot too much, but I'm out on this series.",2015
1,I NEVER watched The Walking Dead.,2017
1,"Poor acting, poor story, poor premise. It's been done 100 times. The world ends, people make dumb decisions and then they die. Same here. 2 episodes in, and the thoroughly unlikeable cast run around LA doing pointless and ill-thought out things. Hey, if you can reach your kids on the phone - lie! Tell em their moms dead - that'll get them to come home! After all the world going to hell and you all need to get together and flee, right?",2015
1,"The characters are unappealing, where everyone does not tell anyone what's going on or at-least try to share or explain what's happening, totally illogical interaction with people and family. ",2015
3,"This series is off to a horrible start not because it seems boring, it's the god awful writing. In the first half hour I watched the husband go into a church full of blood, look at it like it was as normal as anything else he'd seen, walk out and end up in a conversation with his wife over mundane family garbage. Then offhandedly half mentions the church covered in mass quantities of blood. No need for police here sir. Then, husband AND wife go into said blood covered church. Again glance around looking completely bored. Leave. Nope, no cops. Instead of going to the police station and telling them about the obvious remnants of a massacre let's drive to this kids house and looked spaced out as we blandly ask where our son is. Completely believable stuff. I expected the show to start off slow, but I'm really unsure if Kirkman is writing this drivel as he has a pretty good track record...guess it was time to add the big black mark. Heroin addict kid is already getting played out. Husband's son is a very boring character. Daughter won't survive another season if she keeps being as smart as a carrot. I really have to push myself to watch these episodes. maybe it'll get better..",2015
7,"It's a real shame that most people rate shows on a ""0 or 10"" scale. Most of the complaining I hear about this show stem from people wanting it to be more like TWD. If you'd like to see something that is not TWD, but exists in the same universe--I think that's called a ""spin-off""--then this show is that. Different places, different faces. Some of the characters make dumb choices, some are boring, and some are annoying. Viewers really seem to hate ""realism"" despite always screaming for it. ",2016
1,"I really wanted to like this. I tried once and got through the first two episodes like I was enduring a trip to the dentist; Admittedly painless, but I really wanted to be somewhere else.",2016
5,"It seems that the main premise of this show is that this is a spin-off series to the Walking Dead. I know that sounds redundant, but after watching the pilot, it seems clear that the producers were only banking on the fame and popularity of the main series to sell this show. In fact, the entire plot of the pilot essentially builds off the dread of all the events that the audience knows is coming. We watch as the populace ponders the crazy events taking place on the news, while simultaneously downplaying the threat by going about their daily routines. As an audience, I think we are supposed to yell at the screen ""Oh my god, you have no idea what is coming! Run for the hills!"" In reality, it comes across as anti-climatic, because the stuff that is coming in the future is much more interesting that the show that we are watching now. If this show does not catch up, it is in real danger of being the dull younger brother of a much more interesting show.",2015
2,Late comer to the Walking Dead and love it so was looking forward to catching up with FTWD. Sat through the first two seasons and I still can't decide if it is meant to be a comedy. The characters are soooooooo stupid that it makes it painful to watch. I am actually cheering for the zombies to kill them.,2017
5,"The first episode was bearable and it drew me in a little bit, the second episode was a joke.",2015
1,"After the first 2 episodes in the second series I have finally decided that this show is completely hopeless and I'm siding with the zombies, hoping they would munch away all of the current characters so that we can get a new set together with a decent and consistent story. So far all of the decisions taken by this group are totally unbelievable when not utterly stupid and morally questionable. Unwatchable.",2017
1,"I had very great expectation after TWD. However all exceptions were shattered by dull story line, poor casting, ridiculous characterisation, unnecessary drama and unexplained events. When you are watching an apocalyptic movie or programme, you expect a survivalist character/s but what you get is suicidal people wondering around clueless.. Unlike TWD, this programme lacks strong characters or survivalist spirit (bad direction and boring acting is a plus here).. All you see is bunch of idiots doing nothing and busy in family emotional drama (even when world is ending) what people do not do even in case of casual calamities. None of the character shows interest in surviving or care to be prepared for survival. I bet in case of real apocalypse none of these character would survive first 2 days... I have stopped watching it after 10 episodes of second series, I should be awarded to watch it all long.",2017

And the big question you ask yourself is... How the hell did society fall with zombies like this? With slow and stupid zombies like that life could definitely continue as is. Extremely boring. Also, if you just put some zombie blood on yourself, you are a-okay on the whole zombie situation. They don't care about you. Maybe this is what it would take to conquer the Apocalypse. A zombie perfume. Yes, if this is the prequel to The Walking Dead, then the other show must end like that. Someone invents a perfume and it's all okay. The Walker by Channel. Soon in every Wallmart.",2016

5,"Having a story before the apocalypse it's interesting as a concept and definitely worth watching, but what we get in FTWD is a meaningless plot that cannot carry itself into the apocalypse because it's pointless. All we saw are some characters that I personally disliked and cannot relate to, that defy all logic and reason with their actions. ",2015

2,"So many reviews, so many questions and some answers. So much upheaval over this TV-series, the spin-off from ""The walking dead"" - a show that pretty much anyone felt something deep inside for the humans, individuals played by beautiful character-actors. ",2017

I'm an avid sci-fi fan, but I hadn't heard or read anything about 'The Expanse', and yet it's one of the most ambitious sci-fi (or generally high profile/concept TV) shows I've come across in recent years. ",2016
10,"Highly recommended. I have never written reviews, although I've had an IMDb account for a long time. I give all the new sci fi shows a try, but I end up not following most. So I have a good idea of what's out there for fans. Most new sci fi is ... unscientific, to put it kindly, or just techy stage furniture with soap-opera dialogue and character development. Like most fans, what I want to watch is a great sci fi story that seriously takes into consideration the effect of technology on the world around us, and intelligently explores the possible futures of humanity. I'm also interested by stories that consider the social issues of an alternative world shaped by different forces -- what would happen if, say, people lived on different planets, or if water was scarce, or if you had to live in 0g all your life. I know no sci fi will ever rise to the standards of physics PhDs, but it would be nice if writers occasionally paid attention to one.",2015

That can threw off a lot of people, but if you keep watching, the series shows everything one can hope in a Sci-fi and space opera series. I also realized that the first slowest episodes are much better in a re watch when you know the characters and what is going on.",2017

Excellent story and casting. Very refreshing. The best science fiction series in last decade. I highly recommend you to watch with English subtitles on.",2017
10,"I'm a very lazy person when it comes to reviews, basically it is my first one. But I just really want to support this show as much as I can!",2017
10,Is it possible that the Syfy channel finally produced a space drama that isn't complete garbage? It sure looks like they indeed finally made a good science fiction show that doesn't rhyme with sharknado.,2015
10,"This show makes other Sci-Fi shows seem bad. I can't get into Dark Matter, which otherwise would be a decent show, but after watching the Expanse, it pales in comparison. ",2017
10,"I was hooked almost immediately. The story is great so far, acting is above average, and it has a high production value considering the network. Finally some true science fiction! This is the second show from SyFy that they have produced in the last year that I am impressed with (12 Monkeys being the other)...that is impressive since they basically have had only one really good show to their credit since they came on the air. Judging by the production value, I would say that SyFy is attempting to finally get into TV's golden age...even non- science fiction lovers should get into this one. ",2015

8,"I don't understand why so many people feel they can review a series after watching one (or part of one) episode. I agree that the first episode was hard-to-follow, but the whole point is that the remaining episodes *explain* what happens in that first episode. ",2017
8,So many science fiction series fail because they can not breach the gap between reality as it is and reality as it could be. ,2015

The series would be 9 total books with 5 already published (on goodreads.com they received scores between 4.08 - 4.32 out of 5. I feel this is a good sign for the quality of the story, fingers crossed. The two authors of the book series are also involved in the creation of the show. Sci-Fi shows generally cost more money to make and not always make good money, therefore they are usually the first to go once rating drops below certain value. Really wish they keep this one alive.",2015
9,"First off, I went into this show not expecting much because it was on the Syfy channel. I have enjoyed titles by them before, such as Dark Matter, Eureka and Defiance. But most Syfy shows have low budgets and a small fan base. This show blew me and everyone else away. Take everything you think about Syfy and throw it out the window. This show seems like a high budget prime-time TV show. I have only watched the first episode so far so I can't speak for the rest of the show. But judging by the first episode, this show is going to be sick. I also recommend Dark Matter. It is on netflix now and I cannot wait for the second season to release. This show really is like game of thrones in space.",2015
10,"So it took a long time for them to bring out the next season of The Expanse, and since then I watch 'Killyjoys' and 'Dark Matter', DM being the better of the two. To be honest I had forgotten about this show and even part of the story. So after a quick recap of the last season now I remember why I liked it so much. I then watched all 3 current episodes in one go at the time of writing this review, and have to say I love it. It kills the Killjoys, Dark Matter... yes still keen but The Expanse has come back with a vengeance!",2017
9,"Damn. If the Syfy (I hate that abbreviation) Channel would show more stuff like this and less from The Asylum, I'd watch it more. This is simply great SF. The physics of space travel are as realistic as can be. The characters, from Miller the beat up Belter Cop, to Amos the Earther, to Holden the righteous captain by default and the places, Ceres, Tycho, Earth and Mars are all well defined and believable. The sfx is brilliant and the ship designs look like they've evolved from what we use today. The situations, different governments vying for power, resources and land, are all excellently done. A really great adaptation of a really great book series. This should be watched by anyone who even claims to be a sf fan.",2017
10,"Well this will be one obsolete review as by now pretty much everyone agrees this is probably the best sci-fi TV show of today, and the ratings seem to prove it. I'm also a few years late. However, I've had like a sip of wine and it just crossed my mind once again how awesome this show is, and how happy I am in general to witness the amazing sci-fi television achievements of today, with film technology finally catching up with the awe-inspiring ideas this genre has been giving us since its conception. I. Am. Happy. Have been miserable approx. ever since Battlestar Galactica ended, whining how there hasn't been any decent space sci fi on television for ages, and all of a sudden I got this, and several other decent shows followed - for crying out loud, we have like TWO Treks going on right now!",2017
8,"Since Gravity landed on cinema screen a few years back, there's an increased interest on futuristic theme. However, television series of such kind hasn't had much improvement even though there are some niche shows like Killjoy or Dark Matter.

Its graphical prowess and meticulous design is light year beyond others, and with great cast of multifaceted characters, this is primed to be a modern marvel.",2015
9,"The Expanse is based on the series of novels by author James S.A. Corey (the pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck), with the first season following the first book, Leviathan Wakes. In it, Detective Miller is looking for a missing girl, Julie Mao, a missing persons case being a very rare occurrence in the Asteroid Belt. Elsewhere in space, Jim Holden, part of the crew of the Canterbury, hears a distress signal calling out near a rogue asteroid, and has a few of the crew- including himself- to investigate, all the while tensions between Earth, Mars and the Belt are headed to a heated stand-off, with terrorist and activist threats continually growing.",2015

10,"Please give this show a chance. It is original and willing to take some risks. If you ever wished your own life were sprinkled with musical numbers about your neurotic tendencies, well...let this be your model. It let's you embrace your inner-nut-case, feel good about your quirky habit of imagining your life is a Broadway show, and brings you out of the surreal moment in history we now inhabit by plunking you down in Rebecca's wonderland.

8,". but I enjoyed this. Yes, it has some (well done, IMHO) musical numbers. If this makes your eyes roll back in your head, then nothing else that anyone says will probably make much difference to you. Is it different? Yeah, sure it is. As someone else already proclaimed, it is ""refreshing"". With so many other ""attempts"" at comedy programming, which simply retread the same formula (ad infinitum), it's enjoyable to see someone do something completely different. I also thought that the premise of the show was clever, as well, and thought that the initial musical presentation of that ""plot"" enhanced it, instead of detracting. (It pretty much ""enhanced"" and legitimized, the craziness of it all, which I assume to have been 100% intentional.) As I'm only one episode in, it's hard to know how the writing will hold up. I'm far more concerned about the fact that (in most parts of the country) it's head to head, with three, double-digit ratings, ""big network"" programs. That may say more about its ability to survive, than future scripts, musical numbers, or anything else. It feels a lot like the CW has simply offered it up (from the get-go) as nothing more than a sacrificial lamb. In fact, it's probably the absolute worst possible time slot, in that it's up against two reality shows, one involving singing, and the other dancing. If there's an audience that might have actually been ""the most likely to enjoy"" a comedy that folds in full (singing and dancing) musical numbers, it's probably the folks that are already invested in two of those three double-digit (ratings) programs! Anyway, if you are interested in trying a ""different comedy flavor"", at least give this a try.",2015
9,"I am thrilled I stumbled on this. It has a very unpredictable fast comedy style, much like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It may not last long because it doesn't hold to the generic boring sit com standards that make me want to throw the TV like Mike & Molly or 2 Broke girls. You can say the joke before it comes out of their mouths with those shows. No filming studio family room or terrible NBC/ABC sets with this show. I never know what joke is coming with Crazy ex girlfriend and that's the best part. They don't lay the jokes out for you like an idiot. They rely on body language and facial movements to bring the awkward joke moments. To get the belly laughs (very rare in TV comedy) you may have to watch it a little more closely and listen to the fast writing style with a little more attention.

You cannot take your eyes off of her, and she has great hooters. The other cast members are also extremely talented. But the premise is, even giving it slack for its inventiveness, ""crazy"".

She doesn't shy away from being a little dirty and exploring comedic taboos while at the same time showing off real class. This woman knows how to mix the good and the DARK and Bible Thumpers are sure to hate her intensely while secretly drooling over her image in their prayer-closets. I can also imagine all the forthcoming verbal assaults a ""Million"" Moms and others of their Evil ilk are probably preparing against her because of this show! (－‸ლ) Let the hate flow! She's not going anywhere and her show probably isn't either. ",2015

Also, needed the change from the untalent of reality TV. Soooo happy the art of dancing, acting and singing is still being taught, learned and now employed. Bravo/brava...

The song and dance number last night where they did a Ginger Rodgers/Fred Astaire send up (I think it was called ""Settle for Me"") was great. I think the dialogue is reminiscent of Princess Bride. This is the best show of the season for me. I love the quirky characters especially the next door neighbor. My favorite thing is that everyone is quirky without having to ridicule or belittle others. This is a great show for those who think what if I had followed that first love, taken advice from a commercial etc.",2015

Went to YouTube and watched her short musical postings. She is very creative and professional on these videos. We really like the innovative musical interludes on Crazy that are original compositions. More interesting than the redone songs of Glee. The other actors are getting to be believable characters also and hope they continue to develop. Overall a feel-good fun show.

Out of all the new shows this season, this has by far been my favorite, and I hope that this show gets picked up for renewal, as I am tired of reality TV and competition shows.

In fact, according to just about every article I have read about it, he will not be returning at all to the show. I don't know about anybody else, but I quite liked the love triangle for once. It was fun and entertaining and even though Rebecca is supposedly crazy for Josh Chan, I think it would have been a good story line for her to end up with his best friend. Afterall, they fit well together and he was so head over heels for her. Sometimes actually always most often life is like that. We don't know what we have until its too late but for a show like this where anything is possible, all I ask is that you bring Greg back and lets see how life really would work out for a change. I don't think I like the show without Greg. Again another show that builds you up only to disappoint you by killing off the most favorite characters so to speak. My rating would be higher if Greg was still in it. Bring Greg back!",2017

This year, 'The Scorch Trials', its sequel, keeps some of the original beats of its predecessor, but it eventually falls into the scope of the overly familiar trope that the first film has defiantly avoided, which is a bit disappointing, considering the riveting buildup they've pulled off with the first film.",2015
2,"I recommend any and all who have respect for a writers work and/or have ever read the maze runner series, don't watch the second movie. It was a good movie but it should not have been released under the title scorch trials as it had no relevance what's so ever to the second book or the trials themselves, which is literally the title. I am very disappointed/Very much irritated. The only resemblance to the book was the character names. This also felt like a very sore excuse for a zombie movie instead of having the proper and well thought out story line that manipulated the characters like originally intended. Overall, I say again the movie would be fine on its own with no relation whatsoever with the series but because it is in fact based off of a book series I am very disappointed to see they threw the whole series aside and made up their own story. Very disappointed, I cannot say that enough times.",2015

Well let me tell you, films based on books or comics and stuff like that change things around to make the movie stand on its own and be appealing to multiple people. There's no point in a movie that is exactly the same to its source material because that's only useful for people too lazy to read. If everyone knew this and understood it, perhaps people who don't like that idea could just stay away from the movies and keep to the books, this movie and countless others could be saved all that ruthless hate.

Instead of taking the good and improving on the first one, this movies is basically just hunger games, trying to get away from the bad guys just to get caught type of stuff, and hunger games, these infected human/zombie like creatures chasing people around. Normally I'd still give a movie a chance but I just couldn't. One main reason is the CGI for this movie, it was just laughable. CGI was used for all of the infected characters chasing the main group around and it just looked like CG from movies and video games from 5 years ago, just terrible. They go so far from the book plot line it's ridiculous too. If you want to see it wait until it comes out to online rental or redbox or video store. It's not worth paying to see in theaters.

This was due to the fact that one of the storylines were eerily similar to one from Code Black, which was produced and aired long before said Chicago Med episode had, but . . . I digress.) What attracted me to this show was its decent storylines that more than made up for moments of less-than good acting. I would even argue that the series' second season was even stronger, with episodes like ""Graveyard Shift,"" ""Cold Front,"" and ""Love Hurts."" Now that the third season is far into is its run, I only grow more and more annoyed and bothered with this show. Why? I have a few reasons. Allow me to explain.",2018
4,"This is an okay show. It's formulaic and predictable. Often when patients first came in, you can guess what their storyline will be based on how other shows have portrayed the same issue. There are no significant twists or plot points. You begin to hope there might be some continuous issues that span more than a single episode, but those are very few and far between. ",2017

If he doesn't know these problems he shouldn't use the drugs names. Get creative and make something up but don't use actual drugs names. I usually really like this show but was disturbed about the misinformation presented. The story lines are excellent and I really like the characters on this show.

While I understand that this is a TV show and will therefore have a level of inaccuracy, there are a couple problems that people should be aware of. The number of times a nurse has said ""Yes doctor"" on this show is so disturbing. I have never said ""Yes doctor"" in my life! Sixty years ago, maybe this was the norm. Nurses stood up for doctors then too. Those days are long over. Times have changed, but unfortunately stereotypes have not! Nurses aren't glorified secretaries as they seem to be on this show. Nurses don't just answer phone calls, usher family members out of the room, and hand physicians charts. There are secretaries to ""page the OR."" 99 percent of medications, blood products, and IV fluids given in real life are given by nurses, not residents or physicians. Those include life saving medications such as epinephrine during CPR and clot busting medications like TPA given during an acute stroke. In addition, nurses make recommendations for lab work, treatments, and medications to physicians on a daily basis and physicians ask nurses for their opinions, especially in the critical care settings, like the emergency department.",2016

Was there no medical technical adviser on set? Or anyone with ears? Viewers have seen enough medical dramas to know that the word is ""intercranial"", that's in ter cran i al — 5 syllables — but he said ""intercranal"". Not an auspicious series beginning.

How are the writers allowed to come up with such story lines, it should be an abomination to medicine and television. I want to give the show a chance, but with no excitement, predictable story lines(replace the writers pronto), bad, just terrible/unrealistic approach to medicine (plz fire the medical consultant), poor acting by most of the cast (understands that it comes with experience but......), just a waste of a TV time and my DVR's space.

It's largely due to the delightful performances of Oliver Platt and S Epatha Merkerson - not that they're even featured as frequently as the younger actors. I just really respect and enjoy their performances. Of the younger crowd, Colin Donnell reminds me of a younger Patrick Dempsey, and I really enjoy the story lines with Dr Choi (Brian Tee) and Sarah Reese (Rachel DiPillo). Choi reminds me a bit of the Tim Kang's Kimball Cho from The Mentalist - sharing the same stoic, efficient, pursuit of excellence in their jobs. DiPillo is believable as a young, hesitant med student who is still trying to find her place among the other health care professionals.

Like many other series, main actor knows everything. I would rather watch, House MD or Code Black or even Greys anatomy. Please don't waste your time. I have no idea why it is still on air.

Pathology may not be front and Center in the patients face during all care, but showing only ""basement dwelling, autopsy happy, nerds"" is not just a slap in the face, it's also disrespectful on so many other levels.

Some times he has to think about certain situations but he comes to the right conclusion. Sharon Goodwin has the most important but mentally intense job in keeping the ER running smoothly but quickly. She does a great job at her role. All the cast do a great job at their characters. Chicago Med with each episode keeps you drawn to the show until the end. The situations the team go through are intense but everyone does their job to help the injured. I like how the producers bring all the Chicago shows together, it makes it seem more like reality. I hope Chicago Med goes a long way. I don't miss an episode of either of the shows.

A nurse joined us with a cooler of dry ice & 8 caps, because they must be changed every 20 minutes during chemo & for 3 hours after. The catch is that this is expensive & not covered by insurance.

10,"Spent my whole night, which I previously planned to go out with some folks, to watch some episodes of this. I have never really seen Daredevil as cool as how he is being portrayed in this series. I know that the comic book has always been dark and gritty, but with the effects they added to each scene, I feel just like trapped and cannot stop watching. The acting is well, I don't know how to put it, but I feel like I was watching real people doing real stuffs. The action scenes are awesome (I am not gonna say that it is as real as the lawyer acting). I have never even batted an eye to Daredevil before today (moreover after that previous movie), but I assure you, I will have his poster on my wall tomorrow.",2015
10,"Didn't really have any expectations for Daredevil. After watching the movie as a kid and not overly enjoying it, I think Marvel has done an amazing job now that they have Daredevil back in their control. I love how mature it is compared to the other movies/shows Marvel have been doing in the MCU. The dark tone and violence they have incorporated will please a lot of people that have been wanting to see that from Marvel (me included). The cast and the writing are excellent and I look forward to possible appearances by other characters that Daredevil has either worked with or fought against in the comics. Very excited to see what else Marvel can produce with their characters that have yet to hit the screen.",2015
9,"What can I say? Growing up I was a massive Daredevil fan but in my later years fell from grace on that front. After watching the first episode of Daredevil, though? I'm all in.",2015
10,"Well, here is a show that really surprised me. I was expecting the usual Marvel show, but what did I watch, a show with Gotham quality. The main players are at the moment still evolving, the acting is on par with the script and I hope they can keep it up to this standard and not fall into that ""lazyness"" that sometimes appears after a few shows. It would seem once again choosing a non-American as lead has paid-off. It's like the fresh blood into a dying species. So, for fans of the not so run of the mill comic adaption I can thoroughly recommend this, and for all those out there that need everything to be bright, colourful and loud you should watch this just to see how good something can be without all that. That makes it sound boring but I can assure you, you may just be as surprised as I was.",2015
9,"Daredevil is the kind of show that, even when taken out of context, is still a great piece of work. Even if Marvel wasn't associated with this at all, Daredevil would still be one of the best crime/vigilante dramas out there. It's just great storytelling elevated by its superhero backdrop, with classic characters like Wilson Fisk and The Punisher butting heads with Matt Murdock through insanely choreographed fight sequences (the best in Marvel history) in the dark, gritty streets of Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil shows the grimier side of Marvel for sure, not quite as disturbing as Jessica Jones, but there's a fair share of graphic imagery. It's never gratuitous, though. The violence is real and raw, and you believe the wounds Daredevil gets in his numerous altercations, painfully so. Every little detail is accounted for, from the functionality of Foggy and Matt's lawyer firm to the martial arts techniques used in the many mind-blowingly impressive fight scenes. It all works so well; the writing is sharp, sometimes slow and brooding but it always pays off, and it's character-driven without delving into soap opera territory like many comic book shows do (though the Elektra storyline comes close). ",2016
10,"After delivering a wonderfully crafted show with Agent Carter, Marvel is back with another one, Daredevil. I love Netflix. They are enjoying good business. I think Marvel is one step ahead according to DC in TV series. ",2016
10,"This is the Marvel show we have all been waiting for. It takes place in post Avengers New York and criminals are taking advantage of the city. What I like about this show is how naturally it fits in the world already created. The question has come up recently that there are several heroes in the universe that cant hold up their own movie but that people want to see. One of the ways was to include them the bigger hero's movies but it never feels like they are doing the characters justice. Then someone got the idea to do TV shows for them, and while Marvel Agents of Shield is one of the worst shows on television, Daredevil works great and I hope the Jessica Jones and Luke Cage are just as awesome.",2015
6,"If the tone of this is overly critical, it's only because everyone else seems to be raving about this series. I honestly can't believe the hype it's got - it is distinctly average.",2015
1,At the moment this show has a score of 9.3 which is completely unrealistic and an insult to your intelligence. Be warned this show is made only for 12 year old comic book fans. If you don't care about comic books or have reached puberty STAY AWAY!!!,2015
9,"First ,,, again as a second show i watch on Netflix after ""bloodline"" .. i truly love it ... showing a half season in a day is genius ,, it's like they're telling you ""here's a whole season in a couple of days,then tell us what you think .""",2015
1,I imagine this 9.2 rating will drop considerably in time. Do to how much of an effort it is to stay interested throughout each episode. There is too much pointless dull dialogue between action scenes. I literally play on my phone for about 20 minutes at a time while sort of paying attention to this show and I still haven't fallen behind. ,2015
1,The unrealistic plot lines are near maddening. I can suspend disbelieve long enough to accept a blind man beating up countless bad guys but the story writing and amateur acting skills of the main characters is unforgivable.,2015
3,"I have rarely watched a show where I wished so much for the demise of the protagonist, sadly Murdock couldn't lose a fight if he tried. It gets old and predictable way too fast. The boy scout cliché in particular makes me detest this character, he is as one-dimensional as they come. I get it, he's catholic, snore. I am not often one who struggles with the suspension of disbelief but I did with this show. Each episode has a plot point that is seemingly random and never seems to go to anywhere, they only serve themselves. The basic story structure is fantastically simplistic and I mean if you're looking for just really typical archetypes it has it all. I'm convinced the writers just filled a bowl with tropes and just grabbed ideas out; the plucky journalist who just wants the truth, oh look some yakuza, some Russian mobster in a gulag, that's a good one, rich guy obsessed with minimalism, yep got that one, blind samurai, oh hey that's original. The writing is just lazy, this show is completely over-hyped and leaves you with a sense of ""hey, haven't I seen this before?"" because if you've watched any of the other marvel shows or really any show featuring lots of hand to hand combat (Alia, Dollhouse) it's basically go out, fight a guy, win, rinse and repeat, but don't get too close just yet, oh look another pointless tangent and now we're back.",2015
9,"After delivering a wonderfully crafted show with Agent Carter, Marvel is back with another one, Daredevil. I am not a Daredevil fan, in the sense that I've never read the comic or care much about the character. The Ben Affleck movie - that I kind of like - is the only reason I know about it and what the Daredevil Netflix series did was to give the movie fans a sliver of déjà-vu, meaning I felt I was getting into something familiar, but at the same time they delivered a brand new show.",2015
6,I was hoping for more. It's a little dry & slow for me. Sometimes the scenes drag on for too long. Charlie Cox makes a good Daredevil. The ass-kickery is top notch. I was pleasantly surprised about Vincent D'Onofrio taking on the roll of Fisk. He's scared me ever since Full Metal Jacket. Rosario's Claire feels genuine & believable. One of the more honest characters in the show. I wish we could see more of her and less of Deborah's Karen & Elden's Foggy characters. They are both too whiny & annoying for me to give it better than a six. I find myself skipping through their scenes more and more often. I was hoping that would change in Season 2 but it didn't.,2016

7,Pros:,2015
2,"I cant quite get it, Why the high ratings to so many mediocre series of late. This series is of the classic example of said mediocre series that has high ratings, 8.9 to be specific.",2015
1,"When I was slightly younger, I had many of the publications of DC and Marvel, but this awful TV series does not manage to capture ANY aspect of what I fondly remember as a mysterious and almost magical alternate reality.",2016
