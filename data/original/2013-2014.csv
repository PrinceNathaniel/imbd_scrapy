10,"I've been looking forward to a viking film or TV series for many years, and when my wishes were finally granted, I was very worried that this production was going to be total crap. After viewing the first two episodes I do not worry about that anymore. Thank you, Odin:-)",2013
9,"I've been waiting for someone to make a good series about the vikings. I'm from Norway myself, and I'm naturally interested in our history. I've only seen two episodes so far, but I have to say - it really looks promising. The surroundings and nature in the two first episodes is exactly how it looks in ""Vestlandet"", the western parts of Norway. Stunnings fjords with waterfalls cascading down the sides. It really looks authentic.",2013
10,I've watched the two first episodes of the series and I can say that I'm POSITIVELY surprised.,2013
10,"I really enjoyed this first episode. Writing is strong. Acting is good and more importantly I am really fascinated by the characters. The most impressive thing however was the look of the show. Photography, art direction and just whole look is so lush and rich looks like a feature film. Cant wait for episode 2! Both Travis and Gabriel Byne both shine in their roles. I do hope a season 2 is in the works. I have read a lot about vikings and I can see the makes really went to great lengths to bring the true viking ways to the screen. Especially the religion and gods. I am a fan GOT and this show is great that it delves into the ancient world, but this show has a different flavor. More raw and intense, but still with a nice magical feel to it.",2013
7,"First of all: I really loved this show and this is the first review I write on IMDb is about this show, because it's simply my favorite show. I would gladly give it a 9/10 or 10/10. But the last season, season 4, ruined it for me.",2017
10,"There are some Hollywood liberties taken during the show this is to be expected it is a show. If you made a show about everyday life during the vikings time most would be dull and not exciting it is not like they went to battle everyday. The show has a lot of historical basis with some liberties taken to liven the show up. It is well produced and has great cinematography . If , you are however looking for a straight fact based view on vikings go to the library and pull anthropology research journals out. For everyone else if you like battles with historical styles, understandings of how they navigated and views on the social structure of the vikings then you will get a understanding. You will also see how laws and ethics were for the vikings so yes there is some historical accuracy to the show . All in all if you want entertainment mixed with history it is a great show.",2013
9,"As usual on IMDb fictional dramas set in a particular period in history attract the bores that insist on bleating 'its not historically accurate'. Well just ignore them as this is a fantastic and exciting look at the relatively unexplored Viking world. In the same vein as other fictional historical dramas such as Spartacus or Rome the plot centres around a single character and their family. We then take a brief look into their world and are shown how dangerous a place the world was at this time. The show has a quality feel to it not like some of the more poorly made historical drama around today (sorry but Camelot was just awful!). The sets are impressive and believable and the direction and framing of each scene is obviously set by a skilled hand. The characters are all interesting and likable and the acting is top notch. The only negative I could draw on was that there could have been a bit more action in the first episode but what action there was was very well done. My advice to you, just watch and enjoy it for what it is and don't be out off by the history buffs. If we insisted on only ever watching historical drama that was 100% accurate I'm pretty sure we would be watching none at all. Great show, a solid nine out of ten.",2013
9,"Maybe it isn't real 100 percent history. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part is seems to ring true.At times it almost seems like a contemporary crime drama, but the facts are there-the raids on British monastaries that did occur in the late 8th century, a fairly realistic depiction on what Norse life was probably like at this timeline, the spectacular countryside with its majestic forests and rivers, and the depictions of the Vikings themselves. Savage, eager to loot and plunder, but nevertheless bound by a sort of code of honor. Their acts are savage and the chieftan seems more like a medieval Godfather who uses his power for his own personal gain and who is not above killing somebody on the spot if he is displeased with his actions. The storyline is fairly literate and not the usual mindless adventure that too many of these movies present to us, and the characters are convincingly drawn and likely motivated. The music is good and the full size replicas of the ships are very accurate. Even the deliberate pace works to its advantage, we are never rushed and the story develops as it moves along. It is never dull and there is plenty of interest to engage the viewer. However, if you are put off by graphic violence , don't watch it. Those times were fairly brutal. Fine entertainment . Enjoy it.",2013
10,"There have been one or two negative reviews posted about this show and I have to say that after 2 episodes, I really like it... nit pickers may say that there are historical inaccuracies, but there are also many myths dispelled ... and with the appearance of Valkyrie on the battlefield at the very beginning of ep1 to take fallen warriors souls, unless you are deluded and believe in that being factual it was clear from the very outset that there was always going to be some dramatic license used. Others say the show is too Hollywood, this has to be the case to some extent but by no means is this another mass produced piece of garbage, unless you want the show cancelled after the pilot it must appeal to a mass American audience as entertainment it isn't a documentary. I personally feel that the show DOES have a European feel which is absent in many historical dramas, the locations are beautiful, the cast has been well selected and act their parts fantastically well. The good guys are instantly likable where as the bad guys you just can't wait to see them get whats coming to them, that is always a good sign as far as I am concerned as i want to see what happens to them and am looking forward to the next episode. So don't be put off by the pedantic armchair historians out there give vikings a chance.. it is what it is.",2013
7,"As other users noted, it is becoming a soap opera. The whole thing with Rollo also doesn't make sense: why kill your own followers if the Emperor wants you to prevent other vikings from sacking Paris? How does that fit with the history of settling Normandy with a viking band whose leader is named Rollo? By the way, what happened to England (besides the rubbish going on in Wessex)? Ragnar Lothbrok is getting spread a little thin here. Worse than that, the constant infighting, betrayal and Ragnar's weird mind trips is really bogging this show down. If they don't get back to pillaging and exploring soon, I may not stick around. The show started off strong, but I get the feeling that nobody expected it to make it to the 4th season. The first 2 seasons were strong, and I recommend them. However, the project is now so diluted by the four different story lines that it is now lost its way.",2016
3,"The effort that they put in to make the series look good worked for a while but in this last series ie no 4 we have seen a very fast decay of the quality and above all of the direction and content script etc. I am not sure why this has happened but the final was just a massive FAIL. The entire episode is a complete mess and the action scenes were just pathetic. What were the producers thinking letting this go to air? Not only are the fighting scenes about as bad as I have seen on TV in the last few years, the ships were a joke and the rowing was idiotic.. Then there were the totally unprpepared scene evolutions. Suddenly Rolo appears out of nowhere with an armada of very weird river boats and wins what can only be described as a battle between the first row of boats as the river is not wide enough for the massive number of boats to get anywhere near each other. So the battle is decided by a few boats and yet we see an entire army retreat, an army of berserker type vikings no less. Then the brothers fight. How totally idiotic that was. Beating each other into pulp and not a single other viking came over to help and put a sword in the ribs of Rolo. WTF? So now for the greatest fail of this show and here we see where a decaying show really shows its colors, in this case a dirty grey. Here we take a massive time leap into a period which can only be described as being forced onto the director by the producers who desperately need to intro the next series which I hope gets cancelled because this has become embarrassing. Valhalla is seriously ticked off.",2016
3,"What happened with this series? First season was great, couldn't wait for next episode to air. Second season not so bad, third, not so great, but this season got from bad to worse. It looks more and more like an soap opera with cardboard characters dressed only by coincidence as vikings, because no real history is respected here. So many pointless violent scenes with sole purpose to schock audiences, with no real importance for the scene. Ragnar became some kind of paranoid junkie, Laghertha a cold heart killer. And what was with all those exotic snakes? They barely made it to Europe but they made a quick trip to Australia to bring some pitons and keep them so lively in a stone cold shack without any heating in the middle of winter. Also there are some birds that are in changes one minute and absent in the next, only to appear by magic again. Really? Anda a Chinese slave in a viking world? So far fetched. I am really sorry about it because used to be so good but I think episode 5 from this season will be my last as this became ludicrous.",2016
8,"I am delighted to see all the reviewers energetically debating the merits of ""The Vikings"" first episode----it demonstrates that they acknowledge the historical value of the period the show is portraying. Yes, there were historical inaccuracies in the plot. This will enlighten the scriptwriters to the fact that viewers ARE paying attention! That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode---all that lush eye candy for a novice historical student of the Viking culture! This episode has chosen to jump in at some point in time, and chose the year of 793----without all the back story of a long and comparatively stable history of trade with the ""southern lands"". The Scandinavian countries were undefined and fluid at that time, and were generally lumped into the ""heathen"" northmen. ",2013
1,"This show has gone right down the tubes as the writers have once again taken what could have been a good drama and turned it into a show about a bunch of angst ridden, neurotic parodies of real men.",2016
4,"As a history buff, I was hoping to see an authentic depiction of Viking life, especially since it is the History channel, and while there is some attempt to do that it is also obvious that the writers and producers are projecting 21th century cultural values into the past and specifically promoting feminism. It is ludicrous to have a diminutive woman like Lagertha and a band of shield maidens take command and become Earl by force of arms. If women attained power in the past it is the same as it is today - not by their own endeavor, but rather through marriage or inheritance. So it becomes more difficult to suspend belief when I see 50 kg women beating and killing 100 kg men. I even read yesterday that one of the writers caters to a contingent of feminist fans in the USA. So while he may placate them he lost me. And a warning to all the lesbian feminists who watch this show - don't try this at home or you will find out why you just can't make it in combat units - you will get pulverized.",2017
2,"When are we going to stop with this political correct pandering? If you decide to do a movie or series about vikings , then do it as it really was, not forcing 21st century elements into the scene. Vikings did not take their wives in raids along with them and it was very unusual to say the least that women had so awesome fighting skills as Lagertha (Ragnar's wife). And then they had to include the ""completely unnecessary nod to empowered women"" scenes, like the rape of that Saxon woman during their first raid? or when Lagertha is presiding a hearing ( that also did not happen) and a man shows up demanding that he have the right to punish his wife and Lagertha of course sends him running away with his tail between his legs... ""YOu will have to answer to me"" and then a Face shot of the guy powerless , having to walk away in frustration after having been dissed and dismissed by a woman, just to make it sure that we get it ... That also would never have happened. Strong women roles do not bother me , it is the fact that they try to impose it on us and it is out of context . And if they are so politically correct, why don't they also have black or hispanic vikings for example? that would be ridiculous you say ?...well, so are these unnecessary scenes",2016
2,"Seasons 1-3 were enjoyable and well worth watching then things started to get weird. For me Vikings ""Jumped the Shark"" when the Chinese princess/slave/drug smuggler showed up. Did she carry 5 kilos of Shanghai Sally up her colon for over a decade or did she grow it during the brief warm season in Scandinavia? After that it got worse. Ragnar's drafty yet frost resistant reptile house and opium den, Ivar the Boneless and his little red wagon, Lesbo Lagertha, Floki the Muzzy lover, etc. etc. etc. Did it get worse after Floki spared the muslims? I don't know because I quit watching immediately after that.",2017
4,"Vikings is extremely over rated. Pros include cinematography and action sequences. Other than that this show is essentially a bad soap opera about vikings with empty characters and shallow dialog. People do not stay in character, the plot and immersion is weak and poorly written lines are poorly delivered. I struggled through 4 seasons but just barely.",2017
9,"I have a major problem with Vikings. How come Legartha, Ragnar's first wife still looks like she's 25 when Ragnar's 70? Right I have to write more about this so I'll go on, Floki is an old man but his wife too has retained her young woman good looks. This is fascinating, obviously the Gods were much kinder to women than they were to men at this time in history or maybe I could dare to venture that this is so far from the truth that it ruins what would otherwise be a very interesting and historically vaguely accurate series.",2017
7,It is clear that the writers of this show knew nothing about the old Viking society or it's rules. It's not for nothing that the first true democracy was established in Iceland where every free man had his vote. What the show depicts is a Stalinistic take on that society which is completely wrong. A ruler like the earl would reign for about a week before he was chopped to bits. I guess it's done that way for the drama but then name the show something else because it has nothing to do with what life was like when every man that was not a slave was a free man entitled is own opinions in that time in that place. Killing a smith (influencial people then because a sword could be worth more than 20 cows or an entire farm) because he made an anchor? Really?,2014
6,"Starts strong, battle scenes are great, but it gets weaker story wise as the seasons progress. Also, too political. In it's effort to create female characters that are on parity with the men, it ends up being a preach. It's obviously influenced by Game of Thrones, but unlike GoT, there are too many Mary sue characters. Bjorn is untouchable, Lagertha can't even mess up her hair. An example;The battle scene where Rollo and Ragnar face each other Lagertha gets stabbed. The scene is obviously made to create suspense, but it miserably fails. Lagertha didn't even mess up her hair. In fact the whole scene is like ''that was the most gentle stabbing I've ever scene! doubt she'll even get a scar''. And of course every male main character drops everything to come to the rescue of this supper bad-ass warrior queen, that castrates men for fun. Cringy scene. ",2016
3,"I subscribe to the opinions of the other reviewers who criticized the weak screen writing of the series. As an historian with a PhD degree in medieval history I was really looking forward to see the series. It's not easy to watch historical films as somebody who works every day with sources and facts. You have to ignore some historical inconsistencies or mistakes to enjoy a play. But in this case something went wrong... Either You switch off Your brains or You're a complete layman in Norse history and mythology. There are so many mistakes in the series, unbelievable!!! There are no fjords in Denmark. For an US-American it must be all the same: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, who cares... (I'm sure, a lot of You Yanks never heard off these countries). All of'em are sooooooo different in landscape. It's pointless and quite tiring to count all the other mistakes after watching 6 episodes so far. As mentioned: The reviewers above me listed some of them. Something I want to bring up (witch made me laugh for almost ten minutes): In the first episode Ragnar refuses to raid to the East. No more ""Russia"" anymore, he states. Wait a minute? Russia? Why not Spain, France, Portugal or maybe Turkey? Why not the UK or the USA then? All these states didn't exist in the late 8th century! The name Russia itself comes from the name Rus and the Rus people, a group of Varangians (possibly Swedish Vikings)who founded the state of Rus during the 9th and 10th centuries. Beside the historical solecisms the story and acting are pretty weak. Travis Fimmel should've been stayed with modeling. His acting skills are very poor.",2013
1,"What a complete utter butchering of Norse mythology, history, and culture.",2014
2,"The first seasons was good. Not as good as Marco Polo or Last Kingdom but good enough to keep me watching. Afterward, it becomes very clear that the producers wanted to prolong the series so they forced the writers to put in a lot of fluff. That reached it's worst in Season 401 with completely tangential and useless scenes like: 1. the Wessex king kneeling before Chris begging for forgiveness but confessing his weaknesses 2. Ragner's sex scene with his Asian concubine in the hot tub 3. and on and on and on.",2017
1,"I was a fan of this show when it started and into the second season. I just finished the third season and I can not believe it is getting such high reviews. I am not sure what happened in this season. I feel like the writers phoned this in. There was no story, just focus on each prisoner's little stories that made a huge effort for watchers to believe that the system is the real criminal and that the prisoners are all just victims. The show isn't even about Piper anymore, her storyline was so weak and boring. The relationship with her and Alex was dull. I couldn't wait for their scenes to end. The only potential storyline was what was going to happen to Alex and they just squeezed in a stupid ending that I guess was supposed to be a cliffhanger.",2015
5,"I am chiming in about this show because I am surprised at how positive the reviews are trending for it. After reading positive buzz over the past several months, I have finally had the opportunity to watch Orange is the New Black. And I am very, very unimpressed.",2013
1,"You don't feel in Prison anymore, Its feels like a High school. ",2015
4,is it because of the occasional lesbian sex shown in a very coy way ? or is it the odd flashing of a stray breast ?,2014
6,"Well the concept of women prison is something new and I started watching it with blank mind. Start is all in all mildly interesting but as the story progresses there is not much to expect. The leading character, Taylor faces multiple dilemmas, most interesting of which is about her sexual orientation. She used to be gay in past but she has a boyfriend now..and then she bumps into her old girlfriend in prison.so that is the most exciting part. But wait there is mild comedy too..she comes across a stalker whose weird acting is to be appreciated the most. The entire season is full of small time accidents and fuss that Taylor comes across. Orange is the new black is not a thriller as a prison based series should be but its close to chick flick. It covers every theme partly so, it is no more than a regular time pass daily soap.",2015
1,I'll be brief and to the point.,2015
9,This show is a seriously funny drama. ,2013
9,"It brings back memories of Weeds. You know in its glory days. The first few seasons before it went off the rails. That's what ""Orange Is the New Black"" is like. Equal parts funny and sad. A mix of true pathos and yet true honesty and beauty coming from the strangest places. Be warned however there is plenty of lesbian sex and if the ""F"" word makes your ears bleed it is probably a good idea to turn back now...This isn't OZ but this also isn't Disney. This is a true winner from Netflix and tells an interesting story not only from the main character's perspective but from the other inmates as well. It would have been boring to see things from just her point of view. Like Nancy Botwin on Weeds, sometime Piper Chapman is portrayed in not so good a light because she can be the villain in someone else's story.",2013
2,"Jason Biggs is one of the least talented actors in the history of film. His chief claim to fame is an almost psychopathic need to have us view his penis on film. And he is the bright spot in this ongoing disaster. (Well, they paid him $8 million for 3 American Pie movies for the use of his penis. It beats getting a job, but it's not really a talent.) Orange Is The New Black is proof positive the public will buy anything. It's the same episode one after the other. Oh, the players and plots change ever so slightly, but there's only so much you can do in prison. Here's how it goes: Show lots of bare beasts. Shower scenes make this a no brainer. Show women, especially women of color as skunks and untrustworthy bullies. Have some lesbian kissing. More bare breasts. More bullying of the skinny white girl. Body cavity search...please bend over. (The character, not you.) Switch to dopey Jewish boyfriend (Biggs) acting like a clueless fool. Make him a writer. Otherwise, he's even more boring. Toss in some heartfelt scenes with parents and friends.",2015
3,"It's a shame, because I initially really liked the show, the first season was so great, but I have to say that I stopped watching it in S4 (I just skipped many parts up until the finale).",2016
1,"Season 1 was a refreshing experience. An innocent educated woman sentenced to jail makes up for a great story to tell. The plot is centered around Piper's troubles and tribulations in dealing with her new life as an inmate, it made me curious enough to watch the whole season, and I liked it. Season 1 turned out to be very successful, the dramatic/comic entertainment value was undeniable.",2014
10,"Netflix bats it out of the ballpark again with another original, intelligent comedy from the Jenji Kohan, the incredible writer who brought us Weeds! I was hooked from the moment it opened. I wasn't familiar with Taylor Schilling, but I am now a big fan. She's totally charming as the lead and there's a lot of heat between her and fiancé, Jason Biggs. The inmates are a crackup. It's inspiring to see a bunch of women who aren't the same clichés we've seen over and over again. In Orange is the New Black, Kohan pushes the boundaries in the same way she did with Weeds. She somehow manages to make her female leads into adorable victims of circumstance, even if they are criminals. I enjoyed Weeds to the very end. Can't wait to see how this series unfolds!",2013
1,"I seriously have no idea how this got 8.3 i couldn't see more than 5 episodes (and believe me i tried). I think this series is just a ""girly"" version of a prison. I mean the worst thing that happened to the protagonist was to not eat for a day or two , watch some lesbian (witch she liked), get commented for her boobs (which again she liked) and cut some of her hair for another prisoner's hair.. WOW SO HARDCORE.In prison break you will see exactly what you want to see. You will be on edge every few minutes and the plot twists are endless.",2016
1,***SPOILERS***,2015
5,"This could have been a really good show if the writers had actually taken the time to do some research on blacks and latinos, instead of relying on stereotypes that are found on the internet. I realize that when it comes to the white inmates on the show there's a good variety of characters. You have the meth addicts, and the hillbilly and the trailer trash, and the naïve blond haired blue eyed princess, oh and there's even a nun. OK that's great, there's plenty of diversity there.",2014
2,"I heard so many good things about Orange is the New Black and the plot made it seem like it would be interesting so i decided to give it a try....I can now say i have officially wasted hours of my life watching one of the most uneventful, overrated, unrealistic and just plain boring shows on television ",2014
1,"If you want to see something unpredictable from the first episode. Well go watch Breaking Bad cause the main plot sucks. Everything that Piper wants she gets. She never has any bad news. It would make more sense if her fiancé, who fought the urge to cheat, cheated on her. From the first episode you realize shes going to get back with her ex Alex. I was really hoping this was going to be a good series and has a ton of potential and they just flush it down the drain. I wouldn't have seen it coming if she backed away from Alex cause she didn't want to be in the hole again, or if she realized that her fiancé was the right guy. Its a lesbian feminist show that holds no real plot twist. I mean the side stories are more interesting then the main one.",2014
1,"The one star is for some of the characters in this, it is no doubt full of talented actors and actresses but I find a lot of the sex, nudity in this series is put in there deliberately for shock factor and it overtakes from any substantial story line. Unlike Breaking Bad, this is not a dark comedy that is effective in combining profound serious issues with humour. It fails at this remarkably in my opinion. I have watched other incredible films that revolve or have a central focal point around homosexuality - like Brokeback Mountain and Monster - these films do not come across as trying too hard to be eclectic because there's a holistic component to the entire story and its depth. They simply just tell the story and the story stands for itself. I guess what I mean is that it is pretty obvious to a viewer when nudity and sex scenes (be they same sex or not) are trying too hard to be shocking or eclectic to increase viewer ship and it gets in the way of the story. It's just trying to be too funny, too different and too deliberate with trying to appeal to men's girl on girl fantasies that the story loses substance.",2013
10,"Jenji Cohan does it again. This show covers the life of an innocent minded girl going through the troubles of fitting in to one of the worst places to be, prison. Throughout her sentence she learns the do's and don't's. she finds living her suburban lifestyle wont work. just like our favorite drug dealing mom, Nancy Botwin, she learns quickly and not always efficiently. It does a great job of entertaining through laughs and a few cries. Great casting and writing. If you enjoyed weeds then I highly recommend watching this. The best (or worst) part is that you can watch all 13 episodes whenever you want if you're subscribed to Netflix instant. I can almost guarantee you will fall in love with piper Chapman. You will laugh and cry with her as she tries to make it through her sentence.",2013
1,"I have no clue who all liked this series. Its slow, boring, badly written, poor performances by mostly all characters. There are many good TV shows out there, this is definitely 1/10 rating I could not watch past 7 episodes of season 1 That too, I was forcing myself. It does not flow well and it tests your patience. I feel all those who have given it a thumbs up are not exposed to better cinema Its time people come up with honest ratings and reviews. Gosh, I hope the producers realize their mistake and don't make season 2 the choice of characters is bad, the plot is boring unlike other series where u cant wait to watch the next episode, this one bores the living guts out of you in an episode. Please please stop this torture",2013
4,"This show has mega-jumped the political shark in Season 4 and gone completely off the rails of what it started off as. The start of the show displayed the true to life stereotyping and racial tensions present in any prison in interesting but constructive ways. Now once interesting characters have turned into cartoonish, ridiculous clichés that instead of mirroring reality, are trying to mirror whatever is trending on social media. The saddest part being that most of the events in the news that the story is trying to mimic have been shown to be opposite or untrue of what they appeared, which makes it now seem awkward. That is the risk you take when you film episodes ahead of time without the facts.",2016
3,"I loved season 1 and 2, I couldn't get enough, but season 3 was a big disappointment. Nothing really happens and is very boring. Seems that the pattern follows the tragedy that happened with ""Weeds"" which had such a good start and then from season 3 it all went downhill. They should have stop while they were ahead. I liked that the story had Piper as the main character, now she is almost absent, and the relationship with Alex is so illogic! How could she forgive her so easy after she let her rot in prison? Because she loved her so much, right? Wrong! The first cute girl she see and she cheat on Alex and then she makes a perfect tattoo on herself without mirror or any knowledge on the matter. Please. And who was the little girl that almost died or the boy in front of the church? Whose memories were? Made no sense.And it seems they cannot afford any quality wig for any character in this movie.",2015
1,"I thought this is a popular series, it must be at least good not expecting this to be awesome.... but after watching orange is the new black, I lost my faith in TV series..Piper chapman the lead of this TV series is so much confused, or the writer of orange is the new black is confused about piper... she don't know what she is up to, she is just lost... so much unnecessary lesbian drama is shown.. I really regret the time I have wasted on Orange is the new black... first season was at least fine...but from second season it was awful... no direction of the plot.. unnecessary characters, unnecessary stories for unnecessary characters...",2016
3,"What happened to Season 3? It lost it's depth! Even Piper has been reduced to vapidity. Episode after episode, I keep hoping it'll get better but there is nothing but shallow characters and story lines. Even the flashbacks, which is basically half of the episode, don't really contribute anything to augment or improve the story. It appears to simply be fillers to just come up with a 55 minute episode. I loved Seasons 1 and 2, and was really looking forward to Season 3. Unfortunately, I find myself bored with every single episode of this season. Even Taylor Schilling, who did commendable acting in the previous seasons, appears to be high on something, in season 3.",2015
1,"I watched every episode of seasons 1 to 4 of OITNB during a bit of a marathon box set run last year. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was really looking forward to season 5 - but what a disappointment! I watched up to episode 4 last night and that's it for me I'm afraid! The season begins with a prison riot and by episode 4 it's still going on with no hint of authorities taking any action! There is no story line - just a mish mash of barely connected 'happenings' that are so ridiculous that they are not even funny (the 'hand in the pocket gun', the half naked guards in captivity, the talent show, 'Red' acting like a 5 year old on a sugar high and absolutely no screen time for Piper and Alex). The only light on the horizon was Uzo Aduba as Crazy Eyes - she was outstanding as always. Sorry folks, but I think this has run it's course.",2017
9,"I respect that different people have different tastes in music, clothes, women, movies etc...but if you are saying that this show is bad I really feel like your sense of humor is lacking. I'm a detective for one of the largest police departments in the country and I will advise everyone that doesn't realize it but this show is closer to how real police go about their day than any of those CSI, or garbage procedural shows. Cops do all that stuff all day...pranking each other, busting balls, trying to have a little fun. The job gets a little heavy sometimes so if we didn't have some fun it would be long days. This show is hilarious and perfectly timed retorts by Braugher and Crews are classic. Its the low key lines that make I hilarious...the over the top cheap laughs are somethkng all shows have to do to please the masses...who are stupid. Pay attention to the underlying comedy...its priceless.......""Terry does love yogurt""",2013
10,"Brooklyn Nine Nine is a new age police procedural comedy with an excellent cast and spectacular production. But that isn't what makes the show great, rather its something very trivial. The show, being a comedy, peculiarly enough,doesn't use any laugh track or a live audience to record laughs. In fact, they just provide us with a sketch where the viewer can decide whether it was funny enough for him to enjoy (laugh) or not.The show should be credited for its humorous subplots within an episode.The cast also portray their characters in an outstandingly witty fashion. The writer's vision of a comic police station is right on the money. I may have been biased so i couldn't think of flaws. An Amazing show. One of 2013's best.",2013
7,"After first hearing about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I was fairly skeptical about yet another attempt on Fox's part to regain their former position as king of network comedy, however; minutes after it had started, I was able to find an affection for this show that I haven't had for a comedy pilot since The Office.",2013
10,"It may be too soon to say having not even finished their first season yet, but since i haven't seen an episode i didn't enjoy i think its safe to say this one is a keeper. The one issue i have is how short the episodes are, which means if you watch the trailer for the series you've already seen half of the first episode. There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.",2013
9,"So I watch a lot of American cop shows like Criminal Minds and Castle, but as much as I love them, sometimes I feel like they're hugely unrealistic and over-dramatised. Brooklyn Nine-nine is a play on those kind of cop shows and it does it spectacularly. Also it even has a more realistic feel than the other cop shows. ",2014
9,"Equal parts Mockumentary-style Comedy + Cop Show = A perfect parody of detective shows. The star detective (played by Samberg) winningly carries the lead with charm (if not grace), but as part of a true ensemble cast, carefully crafted iconic roles played well, and all won me over in the first episode. The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! ",2013
9,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a show about a police precinct in Brooklyn and it follows a variety of characters, who are a bunch of misfits who when they get to work they do a really good job, there are weirdos, nerds, and one of the most egotistical characters you will ever likely see. Despite this all of the characters are amazing as they are all likable and have incredible chemistry which makes this show one you should watch.",2017
8,"I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.",2013
8,"Who would think of this duo would be the best part of the series. Saturday Night Live's Adam Samberg plays Jake Peralta, a cop in Brooklyn, New York. The precinct gets a new captain played by Emmy winner and Homicide: Life on the Streets actor Andre Braugher who plays the straight man to Samberg's Peralta. Braugher is great in his role and one the reasons to watch and the other is Andy Samberg. I hope this show lasts the season. It isn't filmed in front of a live audience. It's more like other sitcoms today where they film in a studio and on location. It's good to have a sitcom in New York City than another crime drama. Audiences need to laugh more these days.",2013
10,"This is my first review on IMDb ever and I'm not reviewing this show because I think it's the best show in the world (How I Met Your Mother will always hold that place in my heart) but because I think it's the best new show of this season and it's really funny (not perfect, but really funny) and I'm afraid that as the ratings for this show continue to drop it's going to get canceled. But that would be a big mistake because it's a very funny show with lots of potential and a great cast. Also, it has Andy Samberg in it which is kind of a guarantee for me. So give the show a chance and tune in so probably the only good new sitcom this year doesn't get canceled like everyone expects!",2013
2,"Just watched the rerun of the pilot for Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I thought it was a marvelous example of why so many people say that current TV comedies are pathetic. There was one small chuckle it got from me during the entire 20 minutes (minus ads, of course).",2014
1,"Maybe this show would be better if they dumped Adam Sandberg. He is just over the top not funny. His stupid childish antics make me roll my eyes. His attempt at forced comedy is painful. The rest of the cast is also fairly weak, but let's try with dumping Sandberg and his completely unfunny antics first. I was really looking forward to this show when I first saw the previews. Not unlike a movie trailer, the TV spots show all of the funny parts out of context. When you see those same lines in context, they become very unfunny. That is an amazing feat. I watched the first episode and was just floored that I didn't laugh once. I gave it a second chance, and again, failed to even crack a smile. Looking back at those episodes, my dislike for the show centers around Sandberg.",2014
3,"I watched the first five episodes of this new comedy, mostly because it received a Golden Globe for best TV comedy series.",2014
2,I am amazed at how some people think that this show is wonderful.,2014
1,"I really tried to like this show. I found the pilot to be inane and not very funny but still kept watching episodes until I just couldn't take it anymore. Samberg plays Peralta. He is NOT funny in this role. His character is just a five year old in an adults body. The jokes are stupid, juvenile, and just terrible. The acting is really poor but I attribute that to the writing because I have seen a couple of the actors in other roles or on stage as a stand up (Peritti) and they were a lot better than the character's they have in this dumb series. Personally I don't see this debacle going even one season unless it is only scheduled to run for 5-10 episodes. Man do I hope so any way because then maybe something good will replace it.",2013
1,"I tried watching this with a couple of friends they said its really funny. I did not laugh once the humor is either childish or just dry and unoriginal. It is terrible writing terrible filming terrible acting this show is literally awful. I don't get how people find it funny, it doesn't have one single redeeming quality I will be very surprised if it Lasts much longer its the kind of show that is laughable in a very bad way. Just take this dry stupid excuse for a sitcom of the air already I would rather watch Disney channel then this garbage. Its ashame as well because there's a couple of actors I've liked on other things but they do not deliver in any way on this show. Absolute stupidity enough said.",2015
1,"So, I've heard about this ""sitcom"" and decided to give it a try. I am this kind of a person who would enjoy watching both ""End of Watch"" and ""The Naked Gun"", so I can appreciate realism as well as humor. I mean, whatever the genre is, it is cool with me as long as it is well made. But this ""sitcom"" apparently tries to be so sickly politically-correct and non-offensive-inclusive-sorry-if-we-hurt-anyone's-feelings to anyone in the entire Universe that it becomes dull. What is the point of making a comedy, if you are political-correctness-scared to the point of reaching a state of total creative disability? If it's so bad, then don't try to be in it, you know. This is what I could suggest to the producers of this ""sitcom"". A regular ""civi"" might not appreciate the whole ridiculousness of this, but anyone who had anything to do with ""the job"" could probably spot a thing or two about a comedy that doesn't even try to base itself on any sort of real ground. What could be funny about a comedy that does not connect with reality? Would you really laugh at jokes that came from some sort of an alien planet? How funny is this for instance: ""you know how an Ih-grr walks in, everyone throws their drinks on the walls, 'cause it ain't even the /Bzzd/ time? Well, yesterday, this lurghry Ih-grr walked in EXACTLY at the /Bzzd/ time and everybody was like 'whaaaat'?"" Obviously, none of this is funny, because it has no correlation with anyone's actual experience. Any so is this ""sitcom"" show - it's non-correlating with what most Brooklyn-based humans get to experience! Do you know what the word ""sitcom"" means? In means ""situation comedy"". We're talking about a genre where certain FAMILIAR situations are taken and twisted around, amplified, ridiculed into a sort of a COMEDIC circumstance. This is exactly how the ""News Radio"", ""Married with Children"", ""Seinfeld"" and so on worked. However, this so-called ""sitcom"" fails this basic rule and becomes something more of a non-situational anti-comedy. One could not possibly relate to any of what they show. Whether it comes to the characters, the situations, the dialog - it all feels fake, flat, painfully conjured up and left behind. Besides, this ""sitcom"" had a chance to relate to some of the Brooklyn residents or frequent visitors of same. But the actual Brooklyn is never actually shown! Why would anyone make a show named ""Brooklyn""-something, but there is no Brooklyn in it? It sounds seriously like the all-time-famous ""Brazil""-titled movie that has nothing to do with the country of Brazil, only this time it's called ""Brooklyn""-whatever and it's not political, sci-fi-eish, funny, clever, critical, scary, violent, sexy or anything else that a movie or a TV series should be like, although it has ""Brooklyn"" in its title, but no one could guess that the action takes place in Brooklyn! So, this time I must announce that the sitcom genre is dead. Great. All we have to do now is watch re-runs of the good sitcoms made in the past.",2015
1,"This show is the worst most unfunny thing I have ever watched. TV is clearly hitting rock bottom. I saw an episode last night at a friends and it will be the last. Not even a single chuckle I got. Sandberg is the most horrible unfunniest actor ever. I believe he only became famous because Adam Sandler ""got him in the show business door."" Nice going Sandler. No characters are funny and the writing is horrific likewise. ",2015
5,"I watched a few episodes before checking the trivia section on IMDb. I wasn't surprised to see that it was modeled after The Office US and Parks & Rec. The same characters from Parks are magically transferred to a police station. There are two guys who resemble Jerry, one scary lady with deadpan delivery (similar to Aubrey Plaza's character from Parks), a ""by the book"" sidekick (Santiago = Rashida Jones's character from Parks & Rec). And Peralta's over eagerness has a Leslie Knope kind of stench on it. ",2015
1,"My wife and I were warned away from this show by our son, who said it was the stupidest thing he'd ever seen. Well, we both watched an episode simply for the fact that it had a corgi in it (we're both corgi nuts) and discovered, BOY did he understate just how much of a disaster this show is! I literally spent more time groaning and rolling my eyes at the horrible script and acting than I did even attempting to raise a smirk. There was no semblance of comic timing or character chemistry. The lines are read with such a pedestrian flatness which is something that I would expect from a Disney channel show, but not a major network sitcom. I really felt sorry for Andre Braugher and Terry Crews, both extremely talented individuals from whom I've seen greatness in other projects. Heck, even the corgi looked bored with this one. The real shock came when I saw that this show was in its third season! It literally made me angry to think of all the excellent shows that never made it to a sophomore season.",2016
3,"This is the case in series I suppose, people who followed the show and get attached to the character and the feel of the series give it high grades. To me this show wasn't funny at all. I saw two episodes of it and I just gave up wondering why I even looked at the second episode when the first had nearly no redeeming qualities. ",2015
2,"I watched an episode and thought hmmm...overuse of quick cutaways, overuse of completely unnecessary panning in and out, poorly set up jokes that weren't funny and have been used countless times. In fact, it resembled another derivative show with the same flaws called Parks & Recreation. What a surprise! This has the same creative team. At least they have saved money by never being original. Even each of the characters is ripped off from other recent sitcoms. Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore. As I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping. There, ten lines. Thanks to seventh grade English.",2015
10,"Comedy is a difficult thing to pull off, especially if you have to do it for around seventy episodes, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine does this to a tee. It's hilarious without fault, entertaining to the max and watchable, so watchable, binge watchable. The characters are all likable and relatable, which many shows fail to do without making one main character annoying or dislikable. It's also very much original, without being original if you know what I mean. It spoofs all cop shows, but does it in a way that the overall project feels fresh and like something you've never seen before. ",2015
10,The show is basically archer but its not a cartoon. One show is CIA one is police. both main characters are complete dicks and idiots but are great at their job. There is the annoying boss. In both shows there the protagonist has a close co-worker woman who is always on his back and thinks there better at the job. Both shows have a useless worker and they even look the same (Cyril and Detective Charles Boyle). Both shows take a really serious job as joke. & there both great.,2014
10,"This show is honestly great. It is easily the best animation show I have seen in a while on any network. The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week.",2014
10,"This is an extremely solid show. It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.",2014
10,"Rick and Morty is a hilarious new show by the genius behind Community seasons 1-3 and 5, Dan Harmon. The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there's no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.",2013
10,"Let me just say that I was very skeptical about this show. Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won't really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.",2014
9,"Heads Up: This review is based on the first few episodes of Season 1 only. I was really looking forward to Rick and Morty based on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this is a hand drawn show like older, more classic cartoons. My concern was that it would end up with a weak, poorly written script. That is not the case whatsoever. This show is incredibly original with its writing, characters, style and imagination. Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10",2013
9,"I just finished watching the first three episodes and feel instantly hooked. I have the same feeling I had when I watched Family Guy for the first time, in which I felt like every single character was interesting and was contributing for the series in their own ways. In this show, things that will make you laugh are dark and awkward at times which succeed every time. I haven't found a single bad moment so far in the first three episodes and can't wait to watch the whole thing ",2013
10,I absolutely love this show... Reminds me of the chemistry of Doc and Marty Mcfly from the Back to the Future series with a rated R twist. Slowly but surely the are tweaking character development. Getting better every new episode!!! I like the way Rick is always drinking and burping and slurring his speech. This show is getting a lot of acclaim with so few episodes and it deserves every bit. Honestly this is the best cartoons aimed at young adults and teens that I've seen in a years. I always get excited when I see a new episode trailer!!! Can't wait to see what direction they take this to in the future. They have set it up for literally limitless possibilities.,2014
10,"Awesome!!!! Just plain fantastic! Just what we've been waiting for! At a loss for words!! Thank You God! It's about time that writers have opened up to ideas from a new realm! This is it! No hold bars, out of this world, other dimensions, straight in your face! Brilliant! I can't wait to see more! I have to see more! There better be more; it would be pretty ugly, otherwise! Hawt-dam! Yee-Freaking-Haa! Sit down, strap in, hold on and be amazed! Super clever, great story lines, great visuals, smooth, exciting, thought provoking works of art; absolute masterpieces! I applaud the writers and commend them for their brilliance and am so excited this is happening! Rick and Morty FOREVER!!!",2014
9,"The show feels fidgety in the beginning. At first it makes you take a second to get used and into it. But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great. Keep up the good work",2014
10,"There were only 11 episodes in the first season, so it seems a little premature and overenthusiastic to call this the funniest and best show on television, but I'm tossing it out there anyway. ",2014
10,"I like this show,and I've told everyone from work to give it a go. For some reason they just don't get it. They're happy to watch another Simpsons episode but for this, for some reason they say no. In episode 6 ,which I've just watched, i witnessed the ""mesecks"" (i don't know their pronunciation , they yell it in a high pitched annoying sound, which is part of their charm), and they just go crazy. Homicidal crazy. Then there was Morty who was almost raped in a bathroom. This sounds terrible. It's terrible in a movie, its terrible in a TV series, and its terrible in animation. But for some reason, no, its not terrible. It's funny. I've never in a review had to justify rape in a toilet as being part of a funny plot line. Well Rick and Morty make it work. There's the father having the best sex of his life in a computer simulation,dog's making killer robots and takings us over before realising they don't want too and surviving a dead homeless guys amusement park internal organs. I don't write reviews often but every now and then i get surprised. Then the surprise is laughing, then its appreciation of the writers and makers. I tip my hat to you good sirs and madams. You have made an original, surprising series. Even if you start stealing from the Simpson's, i don't think i would recognise it because you would twist it into a creepy, unsettling, awesomely funny situation..PS they will start stealing from you soon. Awesome show. I know you can't keep going for 20 years but i would rather 1 season of originality than 20 years of same old, same old. You have a fan.",2014
10,When I saw the 14 age rating come up on the screen I nearly switched off thinking it was a show for kids. It is not. Besides from the content being inappropriate for them it is also far too good to waste on children. The writing is excellent and Dan Harmon's creativity shines through just as it did in Community. Not one episode yet has been remotely clichéd or uninspired. Even with the frequent parodies and obvious references to classic sci fi plots and other films/shows it still manages to present them in a new (and usually pretty damn disturbed) way. Frankly the 14 age rating feels a little low given the casual planetary genocide which seems to occur in every other episode.,2014
10,"Like it says, the show really is that good.",2014
10,"Shows such as Futurama, The Simpsons and Archer were presumed to have set the bar for animated series in the modern era. With all due respect, Rick and Morty walked in with elements from all these great shows and simply decimated the competition. The writers have undoubtedly created a masterpiece. A true jewel among the current roster for similar shows. Every episode is a roller-coaster and leaves you with laughs and thought provoking concepts. The way in which they have intertwined the futuristic elements and family drama in such a coherent and enticing manner is no joke. I've watched episodes over and over again to see if they have any discernible flaws. And I'm glad to say I've found none. The way they've set the show up allows limitless possibilities and that is great news for the impatient fans like me who cannot wait to see what they conjure up for the next season. Truly enjoyable and I recommend everyone give this show a try.",2016
10,Rick and Morty is easily the best animated show on television right now. ,2014
9,"The fascinating thing about ""Rick and Morty"" is that it manages to be funny, thought-provoking, uplifting, and disturbing at the same time. Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon have appeared to have poured their souls into this show. All of the characters have their share of endearing quirks that is typical of animated comedies like this, but they've gone beyond that convention. Far beyond it. This is one of the only animated comedies I've come across in which the character's personal flaws actually feel genuinely painful. Don't get me wrong, I love comedies like American Dad and Futurama, but there's a certain ""sitcom"" quality to those shows' conflicts that gives off the impression that everything is just going to be okay after the episode is over. Rick and Morty on the other hand, just feels so much more human. Time and time again the world seems to find itself at threat and the characters appear to deal with it by making things up as they go--just as actual people do. The end result is a show that that feels really easy to empathize with. I also love the fact that the show manages to bring up existential issues on occasion. Sometimes they're subtle and sometimes they're not so subtle, but they're always awesome. I really think its great that a show like this is confronting such issues. The bottom line is that Rick and Morty is a unique piece of animation that deserves all of the attention its getting.",2014
10,"It doesn't take the whole season to understand the ""WHY?"" for all the good reviews of this series, as it will grasp and turn your mind upside down and inside out you mind from the beginning and have you begging for more, but those last two episodes.. WOW, nothing shy of absolute brilliance and pure art.",2015
10,"This show is excellent, every episode is original in it's own way, and the humor is just the way I like it. The dubbing is just great - really adds a spice to the humor, and even though English is not my native language, I can understand every thing that is being said in the show very easily. Every Sunday night I sit in my chair, get my popcorn out of the microwave, and getting ready to begin another great adventure! the only problem in the show is that it needs to get episodes more that just once a week! I really recommend you to at least try an episode, in half a day u will already be past the last one :)",2015
10,"Truly a huge surprise for the 2014 TV season. Watched the Pilot a few weeks back and definitely felt the show had potential, and thanks to its brilliant use of YouTube to post initial episodes of the show, clever marketing through the use of Instagram and amazing billboards around the US, the show has quickly gained a huge cult following. A lot of credit goes to Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland for creating a universe that is so incredibly diverse, and easily expandable, combined with a truly thought provoking sci-fi element, that the show consistently felt fresh and new with each passing episode. I cannot remember a first season of a show this perfect since the beginning of Arrested Development (and perhaps The Sopranos). These high accolades do not go without merit: the comedy is clever, the creativity resounding, the voice acting extremely well done, the animation simple but beautiful, and the character development among the best I have ever seen. ",2014
10,"LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!! The jokes are original and very funny, and as well as that it is dark when it needs to be and has plenty of heart and can be rather emotional at times. The show has great characters and some really random ones, which is really funny and pretty weird, but mostly funny. Each episode is nicely connected with a mention to the previous episode or two, and always has cool themes and plot elements. I like the fact that unlike most shows like the Simpsons (which is dead now) this has plenty of substance to accommodate the style and visual wonder. This show is meant for teens and adults alike, and contains plenty of references to pop culture like Star Trek, cloud atlas and Garfield. I know this does sound like an understatement, but this show is literally the best, especially with all these unnecessary mindless kiddie cartoons these days which just try to be funny, and what is especially unique about this is that it doesn't need to try to be funny, it just is. Overall this show is worth the watch, you'll be amazed, and especially with season 3 on the way. Check this out, you will love it, that's a fact. WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!!!!!!",2017
10,"Rick and Morty is a show that is fun, smart, dumb, raunchy, and always entertaining. On first glance, one could be tempted to judge this show as one similar to Family Guy or The Simpsons, but that would be entirely wrong.",2014
10,I watched the pilot episode and was hooked. The sick sense of humor combined with the aloof attitudes is refreshing. You can't stop shaking your head at the immense nincompoopery combined with endless genius. ,2014
10,"Creativeness at its finest, and it clearly shows through out any site offering reviews about Rick and Morty. I try to predict the endings in every show I watch. I can't with Rick and Morty. It floats through the episode with attention gathering situations. I stay seated, fully engaged, with such an awesome plot. Laid back enjoying the show, the ending comes around and I'm up off my couch with my brain blown through my head. 10/10. I've also never taken the time out of my day to actually right a review for any other show. So this means quiet a lot to me. The creators have started the shows do not follow in order, but there are a few characters and jokes that are from the latter episode in ones later down in the season. Highly recommend starting from the first episode, even though its not really detrimental to the series if you don't.",2014
10,"Holy crap! I didn't think Adult Swim could make a comeback from the lame duck shows they been ""chundering"" lately. I was dead wrong with this one, I thought the plot was going to be a rehash of The Simpsons or some Aqua Teen Hunger Force clone, but thankfully this is a breath of fresh air, thanks to the creative minds of Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon.",2014
8,I have to admit that I was less than thrilled with this show's beginning. I didn't think the characters were well defined and the plot seemed very lackluster.,2013
10,I heard an awful lot of people dogging this show at its inception. I wonder if they gave up or kept watching? Because if they kept watching I don't see how they could still be hating.,2014
9,I remember how I felt after watching the first episode. It was 'meh' to describe it best. I think it was only out of sheer boredom I continued to watch it. I especially didn't like Skye. I found her too intrusive and irritating for my liking. But I knew the show still had some potential. The other characters entranced me. Sure the plot was bland and boring but I knew it was only the first few episodes out of twenty two. This meant there was room for development. And by gum did that last episode delivered.,2014
10,"I reviewed the show during the first season, when it was just off to a rocky start, and I said it had potential. But that potential has been satisfyingly reached, and continues to increase with every consecutive season. Without giving any spoilers I'd like to know that there are a lot of twists later on in the first and second season, that really make it a lot more worthwhile to hang in for, and when you go and re-watch the first season with those twists in mind, you realize that it wasn't just something they threw in to make it more interesting, it was something they planned from the beginning and dropped little hints towards that no one noticed. Ward was my least favorite character, until his true nature was revealed, and then when you go back and look at it with the experience of later events, you can see that there's much more underneath the surface. They were playing the long con, fooling people and thinking they were an average episodic show, when they had much more in mind for it. I have never been excited for any episode of agents of shield as I am the season three premiere, and I can't wait for the secret warriors story arc. The 10 I'm rating this is a bit preemptive, because I expect that season three maybe one of the best things to happen to the Marvel universe since Iron man 1, but it's also a bit of an apologetic rating for misjudging it early on in the first season. I now prefer agents of shield to arrow which used to be my favorite superhero show, but is now trailing in a close second.",2015
9,At first this show did not grab my attention. I have been a Marvel comics fan for many years and have enjoyed watching it grow into some of the best films in the last few years. ,2014
8,"I watched this because I grew up reading Marvel Comics, I've loved the big-screen Marvel Movies, and I really like Josh Whedon's past work, including ""The Avengers"". ",2013
7,"I have been anticipating this show for quite some time now, and my expectations were high. Let me start out by saying that I am a big Marvel and Avengers fan, so there was no question for me whether to watch this show or not. The fact that Clark Gregg (plays Phil Coulson) was in the cast only heightened my expectations and excitement! The pilot was, in my humble opinion, very decent. I wasn't blown away, but my expectations were met and I was intrigued by the story and entertained throughout the episode. I will definitely be tuning in for the next couple of episodes and ignore some of the bad reviews that I've been reading. The show is interesting and has potential to become a great show that will last for many seasons, which i hope it will.",2013
8,"I'm not sure why some of the reviewers have already dismissed this show. I wonder what people expect from a pilot but I think there are too many expectations based on The Avengers (and other superhero films). It's a TV show so there's going to be a lot of differences with respect to pace, storytelling and character build-up. Don't expect an hour packed full of action like a film.",2013
8,"I think this is an interesting show.As with all new shows they can tweak it as they go along.I thought in the beginning it wouldn't hold my attention,since I have only watched one Avenger Movie and one Ironman Movie,but I am a fan of other Marvel comic movies.I think the spin off to television is a good idea.I like the cast. I think the cast appeals to younger and mature viewers. I really like Clark Gregg's character Coulson,he's vulnerable but strong,very sexy.I think he has all the viewers wondering what they did to him while he was allegedly dead.I hope the fans and the network give this show a chance.I believe it's worth it.",2013
5,"If you go into this show expecting anything like the movies, you are going to be gravely disappointed. Right now it's at about a 5 out of 10. I thought the pilot was at times kind of a snore fest. The writing at times was juvenile at best. I expected so much more from this show, with all the hype and all. I hope it improves in the coming weeks, or it might be taken off my dvr. The pacing of the show somehow needs to be changed. I like the lead actor a lot, and was glad to see him carry his role over to the show. Maybe the wow factor is yet to come. Things need to be explained a bit better as well. I'm sure they can get it right. with so much to watch on TV will there be enough time to do just that.",2013
1,"Bland, boring, and a complete waste of time; I could use these words to describe this show, but why use words most other critics already have.",2013
4,"Agent Phil Coulson leads a team against international terrorist threats too big for the U.S. military and government to take on. As the team is dispatched on missions, they discover there's more to the world than what we experience in our everyday lives. Super villains exist that threaten the very existence of humanity. It's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s job to intervene when the Avengers and other heroes cannot.",2014
3,"I watched the first ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"" with mixed feelings, not really good but not that bad. The story was OK, if not good. But when my college asked how it was, I said : yeah well...it was OK. Let's see the second.",2013
1,"This show just seems to go down hill further and further each episode. I'm feeling more and more less connected with it and it's cast. The missions, the story, the back stories, the cast & the action scenes. I just don't click with it, maybe i'm too old, maybe if I was a kid, I would probably jump for glee over this, but really I just don't find it entertaining. Movie cameo's are fine, but they don't make for great show, I need a story and characters I can really get lost in and I just don't with this show. I'm three shows in and I think I'll give it just one more show and if from their, it just doesn't grab me, even just a bit, well it's one less show for me to care about.",2013
1,"For a show with such big names attached to it, it sure manages to suck really really bad. I've watched three episodes now, and I assure you I will not be watching a fourth. It does absolutely nothing to draw you in. It makes it feel almost impossible to care about any of the characters when they brought back Agent Colston from his death in avengers. How are you supposed to give a crap what happens to any of the characters when they can't be killed. I will never understand how a show this horrible can get a full season order while shows like firefly, Dresden files, and their ilk get the ax. ",2013
1,"Don't get me wrong you guys, I love the Marvel cinematic universe! (Except from the fact that we won't see Spiderman, The Fantastic Four or The X-Men in an Avengers movie any time soon.) But I don't understand why they decided to make a TV-show about S.H.I.E.L.D! The one thing that works in the show is agent Coulson, 'cause he is a bad ass! I'm just having a hard time seeing the point of all these mini-stories that somehow are gonna tie in to the universe of Marvel and Joss Wedon. The characters are grossly unappealing and lack depth, and they don't play well together. A perfect example is the one mumbling scientist in Coulson's team. That guy simply can't act! He should have taken a few lessons from agent Reid from ""Criminal Minds"" in how to play the socially awkward genius. But even if he did, the whole dynamic between the characters is off. The one redeeming quality about the show is the SFX. It really looks good for a TV-show. ",2013
1,First of all I want to know if they forged Joss Whedons name on this?,2014
1,"For a moment i thought i was watching iron man 3 . Because the story line was the same as that movie with the super soldier that explodes . Then i thought i was watching fringe with a bunch of people running around but no one knew what was really going on. Then i was confused when the agent of shield put the superman guy in a choke hold and he went to his knees. I thought oh the agents have powers,,, nope as he gets thrown through the air but is OK. I fell off my chair once and hurt for a week... I had to rewind the ending where the super soldier got shot in the head, They were all smiling and one guy gave the thumbs up. I was like why are they so happy that he is dead. That is kind of mean. Oh he is bullet proof. And the shield guys and girls have the special power of never getting dirty or their hair getting messed up. ",2013
9,"Whedon has done it again. Not only has he given us the greatest superhero ensemble piece that is The Avengers(among Firefly, Angel, and the excellent Sci-Fi epic Serenity, and other things of this caliber)but also this new and exciting take on an established and soon to be shared ""Marvel Universe"" known as ""Marvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"".",2013
8,"The Blacklist isn't the best TV show you've ever seen--it's not edgy or innovative with an original storyline or remarkable cinematography. It doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr. Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its appeal?",2015
8,"I've really been enjoying the first season of The Blacklist. It's thought provoking, has many twists and turns, and the cast is excellent. I feel as if Donald Ressler could use some more character definition instead of just being the angry/arrogant protagonist without explanation, although they may explain it later since I'm only a few episodes in. The only other thing that has bothered me throughout the show is Elizabeth Keen's hair. It looks like a badly placed and groomed wig. I realize this isn't her choice, but it makes her head look large and is distracting throughout many of the episodes. It's a small detail, but a very important one if you want the audience to create a connection with the lead. Hopefully next season they will change up her look.",2015
8,"The thing is, you just gotta decide what you are in the mood for. If you are in the mood for ridiculous, campy fun, this is your show. If you in the mood for gritty, well researched crime-drama realism, this is not your show. It isn't Breaking Bad and it isn't even in the category of the awesome English Detective Show. But it is fun. And it is especially fun if you have, let us say, a bit too much gritty realism in your 9 to 5 and you need to escape for awhile. James Spader has an uncanny ability to lose himself in his absurd character and make us suspend belief, if only for a few merciful moments, and really enjoy the show. It's hard to forgive the writers for the obvious clichés and intentionally constructed character hodgepodges (I can picture them now: ""Okay, for this show we're gonna combine Dr. Lector with Sherlock. M-Kay?"") but Spader and the unbelievable gorgeous token partner pull it off brilliantly. I kind of wish this was more in the style of 24, with more relentless action and less clean sweeping.",2014
10,"I've been looking forward to James Spader's return to the small screen since Boston Legal. and just finished watching last episode at http://www.trailerdb.net as always Mr Spader has chosen well the show to return with, it is a fascinating series about a mastermind criminal turning himself in to the FBI with a list of criminals that are pulling strings all over the world, the people behind the criminals.",2013
4,I was looking for a new show to watch and due to high ratings of the show I began watching but honestly I regret my decision. ,2013
7,with either kidnapping or abducting agent Keane !!! i have never seen anyone get abducted so much in anything ever !! its is almost like she is asking for it !!! Just when you think that Agent Keane has died it turns out to be another elaborate kidnapping. Just when you think that they cant get abducted any more due to extreme repetition they abduct her baby her boyfriend !! I think its time for the writers to find something new !,2016
7,"James Spader's idiosyncratic characterisation of Reddington hugely enjoyable. Megan Boone, however, is dire; she really is atrocious, lacking any of the style, commitment and, yes, humour, that made Jennifer Garner so fabulous in the similarly enjoyable, ludicrous, never resolving Alias.",2016
4,"Let me start by saying there was a lot of hype around this show and it didn't disappoint. The Blacklist is a crime drama, where one of the most wanted criminals in the world(James Spader)turns himself in which triggers a very interesting chain of events.",2013
9,"We don't watch crime dramas much. But Blacklist is an exception! It really gripped me, and James Spader totally eats the scenes he is in. With out him, everyone else is simply blah. I don't even care that the premise of a wanted criminal walking into the FBI and then after being held like Hannibal Lecter, gets to gallivant all over the place in his private jet as a little unlikely. But hey then there wouldn't be a show. I hope they don't drag out the mysteries, tho, but build on them. Im curious, but prolonged teasing is just annoying. The violence may be a little much for some people. But not if your used to Walking Dead or Breaking bad.",2013
6,"This is a great series that starts with a bang from the first episode of season 1 and keeps the momentum going right through to the end of season 3. The acting is first rate by the entire cast, most notably that of James Spader, Hisham Tawfiq, Harry Lennix, Diego Klattenhoff and Megan Boone (in the case of the latter, through to the mid third season). ",2017
10,"Not a big fan of crime shows at all, but the pace and the punch to this show is out of the park good. It isn't often a director and editor are on the same page and can pack in what would take most other shows 3 episodes to get across, they do it in 2 minutes. The show's strengths are not in the acting, because the director and editor has made this about treating the audience with respect by minimizing long drawn out dialog. That works for feature films and long novels, but doesn't work well for an hour TV episode. Ignore the reviews about the acting being so bad, they are doing what the show demands, and it all works. ",2013
2,"I was curious about this very hyped pilot, I like the idea and watched the pilot yesterday. I am not impressed and here is why; There is always a certain degree of imagination of course, that is not only expected but necessary- but the idea of FBI being so incredibly easy to manipulate is appalling. And the agents are portrayed as idiots. I have only seen one episode and I have already lost all respect for them. I did not like the female main character. She is way too gullible and perfectly fixed up even when she is in major danger. I thought we were passed those kind of female characters. And when story fails, because of lack of real people and a fascinating plot, add explosions, car chases and children in danger. I know it will probably pick up, James Spader is amazing in most things he does, but I will not waste any more time on this show.",2013
6,"i won't bother going into the synopsis...the last 70+ reviews did that. although i have continued to watch it, i want to like this show so much more. that probably would have been accomplished if the casting had been better. why oh why...in a town that must have at least 2 jennifer lawrences waiting somewhere in the wings to hit it big... did they settle for someone who can't hold my attention for a millisecond? poor james spader (brilliant as always) needs a foil worthy of his ""hannibalness""...an up and coming jodie foster. the really great shows have lived and died by the whole roster down to the smallest part being cast perfectly. this one couldn't even get the female lead right. and, if i'm guessing correctly, lizzie turns out to be red's kid..i suppose i have to hope she has an FBI sister waiting in the wings somewhere. otherwise, lizzie's in it for the long haul. and i'm probably not. damn..so close...",2013
1,"Watching the show has led to questions about why this is written, and for whom? Uneducated children under 13 years old, or that children understand that it is normal to become mistreated by the Government!?",2013
8,"Once again I see people criticizing a good enjoyable show because it's not like reality and ""Real governments and law enforcement organizations don't operate that way!!!!"" Get a grip people! Batman isn't real either but he's fun to watch! The delineation of James Spader's Raymond Reddington is more important than any hang ups you could possibly have with the plot. I just can't see passing up such a good performance and character study because a fictional show isn't reality. It's not often a real good character comes along and I feel Spader has pulled this one off excellently in every respect. Don't cheat yourself people. It's a good show.",2015
8,"James Spader does of course (well at least for me) 'carry' the series. Its not that he's some 'screen god' (he's not), but he delivers his lines with a convincing 'coolness' which, when added to the screenwriters quirky wit blends to create a performance which I find enjoyable. ",2013
8,"Finally the return of James Spader and in a role tailor made for his intelligent and mischievous acting abilities. Who better to take the lead as Raymond ""Red"" Reddington Americas most wanted man for acts of treason. First impressions after 2 episodes suggest the budget is there to take this show to great heights and there is endless possibilities to where it can go. Lets hope it doesn't rest on Spaders shoulders to carry the show. With so many great shows been aired on t.v today its got its work cut out.But with young Writer/Creator Jon Bekenkamp whose recent success with The Call staring Hale Berry it should have a fighting chance and I for one hope it does.",2013
1,"As the title suggests, there are endless loopholes that makes up the first episode, which is a very big let down and will effect my view of the entire series.",2013
7,"It's a great premise. Very original. The connection between the villain and the profiler seems to be apparent, but one can't be sure. We'll have to see as it unfolds.",2013
3,The good:,2013
1,"I watched the pilot episode. The acting is so bad. I was actually laughing through the entire show. Everything felt cheaply done. There was nothing in this show that seemed remotely plausible. It was like trying to watch a show that combined Silence of the Lambs and Homeland, except they dragged a bunch of people of the street, who had never worked in t.v. or cinema, and said make this show. The script, I think my son's pre-K may have written it. I'm actually quite astonished at some of favorable reviews this show has received. Even Spader, who is normally great, can't save this wreck. Save yourself the trouble, watch Homeland instead. Watch it again if need be. Don't waste your time with this show.",2014
3,"Like any series the blacklist started off really strong. It was fresh, it had it's own sense of humor and the intelligence of the character Red was keeping everyone excited. Unfortunately, the effects have run out. I believe Blacklist has ended up as one poor quality series. Most of the characters are stupid, and that is made so Red can seem as intelligent. The acting of both Liz and Tom has been poor the last 3 seasons and the whole story line, the mystery of Liz's past, has been extended for to long. Just end it already.",2016
10,"If you like Victorian crime shows like Ripper Street, Whitechapel, Sherlock Holmes etc. then you will love this. There are two differences which make Peaky Blinders stand out. The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.",2013
10,"I for one am a huge fan of this compelling series. A wonderful dark industrial landscape, great soundtrack, rich characters that have real depth played by quality actors, all to the tune of a great script and an interesting time line. You an clearly see the similarities with the high quality US series and they have gone for this market and there is clearly lots here that could make it a fantastic long running series.",2013
8,"Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. ",2013
10,"Dirty Pretty Things was good - excellent script, cracking acting... but it wasn't Peaky Blinders and this latest effort by Steven Knight is sublime! A couple of the Midland accents left a little to be desired but that is absolutely the only fault - and one to be easily ignored in the face of great writing, casting and direction.",2013
9,"I was not expecting it to be this good,I really enjoyed all 4 episodes. The story is interesting,the acting is brilliant and the cinematography is just beautiful!I am eagerly waiting for the next episodes.When I compare Peaky Blinders to other popular TV shows that use sex,brutality and violence to shock the audiences and get high ratings(which they actually do)this sincere work is like needlework;fine,classy and detailed.The makers of this drama have not chosen the easy way,they have set off to make a first class period drama,that dares to be different.Cillian Murphy is at his best,I will even go as far as to say that this is one of the best performances I have seen of him.Sam Neil and Helen McCrory must be praised,all casting is perfect.Peaky Blinders sets high standards for other television dramas to follow.",2013
9,"Cillian Murphy and Sam Neill are Amazing. I started watching the series because I saw that Sam Neill was in it, and that other guy who had a bit part in the Batman movies. As I watched the series I found myself extremely impressed with Cillian Murphy's acting. That was one of my first thoughts. As I watched on, I realized that the entire cast was great. The writing, character development, the acting, the soundtrack, the camera work.... the grittiness of it all. Usually a series takes a show or two, or even the entire first season to pull itself together into something great, this show started of spectacularly and rips right through the gate!",2013
8,"The premise is very well conceived and overall fulfilling. This may be the show to look out for to make it through the long stretch. High production values, brilliantly realized and meticulously detailed...intriguing characters that are unique and well written...fantastic cast all structured in a solid engrossing narrative. The integration of modern music gives it a very other dimensional feel that is richer and has more urgency than that of other period pieces which often come off as caricatures of themselves (cough- boardwalk empire). Authentic and powerful, I see this ascending to peoples must watch list. It is exciting to see where they are going to steer this one.",2013
10,"As a big viewer of the fantastic US drama series that have been available for the past 8 to 10 years, I am surprised and impressed with this series. It is thoughtful, has enough twists to keep us slightly off balance and the lead character - Tommy Shelby - is mesmerising. It also feels very real, which one would expect of the BBC, and I find myself thinking about it long after I finish watching each episode, so I guess that makes me engaged. such a shame only 6 episodes though - that is where the American series really do generate cult followings. Hopefully, Series 2 is being greenlight as we speak. And thank you Red Bee for the sub titles!",2013
9,"As a born and bred Brummy with a mild interest in our history, I'm really pleased with this series. Firstly that we're not being overlooked for London, Manchester or Liverpool, and we're being allowed our own history, which is interesting and colourful.",2013
10,"After watching broad-walk empire and finding it one of the dullest shows driven by boob exposure and shock value, and just as I thought that T.V is being dumbed down... Peaky blinders arrives. With a take on historical facts put together into this genius piece of art. I have to say i'm breathless . The acting is both engaging and real , the directing is done to absolute perfection , and the feel of the whole show brings darkness and a slight sense of humour that keeps you entertained. Also a show that doesn't parade naked women around every 5 seconds deserves a full 10 / 10 on that fact alone! Clean , dark , funny, alive, and real! My perfect show finally on TV! I just hope they make more!!!!!",2013
10,Cillian Murphy plays an excellent role as a de-mobbed Sergeant Major who is not about to put up with poverty after returning from Flanders Fields. ,2013
10,"This is my first review and I just had to do it. This show is outstanding in every aspect! acting, background music,the customs, details, its just unique. When I compare Peaky Blinders with other TV shows that use drugs, sex, and violence to shock the public and get high ratings for that, this sincere work is on whole different level; classy, elegant and simply amazing! Cillian Murphy is at hes best, pure excellence! Aldo its not only him, the whole crew is excellent, especially Shelby brothers and Tom Hardy (this is probably best acting of Tom Hardy ever).",2016
10,"Staggeringly good. A truly astonishing, lyrical, poetic and immediate invocation of the violently humane and brutally resilient England that crawled from the abyss of The Great War. This is four dimensional television: where the past redefines the present. Permanently. Also The tense scene between the IRA man and Tommy was the best few minutes of drama I've seen for years. Faultless acting, especially from Cillian and Tom Vaughan-Lawlor. Brilliant British Television. I'm just so glad the BBC has commissioned another series, because this show deserves another 4 series if the writing stays this good. Moreover the comparisons between Board walk Empire are annoying. This has a completely different atmosphere not least because of the working class British setting and the music.",2013
10,"Having never heard of this show prior to seeing it on Netflix, I must say I was quite intrigued right off the bat. With a rather unusual name, it stuck out like a sore thumb in my recommended section. After finishing the first season, I immediately watched all 6 episodes again. Now that i've finished it twice, I can easily say this is one of the best shows on British TV currently, and can stand toe-to-toe with anything HBO or Showtime has to offer. ""Peaky Blinders"" touches on a relatively unknown and fascinating portion of British history, and is supported by some of the finest acting I have ever seen on TV. ",2014
9,"As a fan of Cillian Murphy, I watched the 1st episode in great anticipation of his role -- To my surprise, Sam Neill's role is the most captivating of the cast -- While Mr. Murphy plays the strong silent type, it is something we have seen him play before – Regarding the role of C.I. Campbell, the writer's of Peaky Blinders will probably get awards -- Mr. Neill lights up the screen with his superb demonstration of dialog well-written -- I simply do not see Sam Neill but the character, C.I. Campbell -- One small criticism -- the one flaw the British t.v. shows/writers fall victim to is the need to ""tip"" the plot ahead for the viewers -- Just when I gladly welcomed the fresh writing of ""Sherlock"" and ""Downton Abby"" and their use of unabashed surprise to keep us watching, the writers of Peaky Blinders revert to the tried and true very ""British"" way of keeping viewers tuned in -- talk about spoilers to a story line ! I will continue to watch ""Peaky B"", and welcome these characters in my home.",2013
10,"The show may walk on a slow rhythm in the beginning but let me tell you this, I've finished the show and to be honest with you all .. Peaky Blinders is one of the best shows aired this year. it's steady, solid and beyond amazing. Cillian Murphy performance is literally great along side with Sam Neill, Paul Anderson and Helen McCrory. The show tell the story of a man ""Thomas Shelby"" Shelby family is a big name in Birmingham they're the good bad guys against the good bad cop Inspector Chester Campbell played by the great actor Sam Neil but this is not all. the show has deep events and deep story behind it as it's continue.",2013
10,"This was a great surprise, I agree with the prior review Boardwalk Empire falls flat when compared to Peaky Blinders. The acting is topnotch, The story line is awesome, I love how real life characters are added to the story, very good character development, the costumes the scenery are very convincing, I'm watching the first season back to back, that's 6 episodes an hour each. I can't wait for season 2. Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby was an excellent choice he becomes Thomas very convincing, Sam Neill as Inspector Chester Campbell is also dead on, he does a great job, and then there's Helen McCrory as aunt Polly & Annabelle Wallis as Grace two beautiful women perfect for the rolls they play, I can go on and on but I'll stop suffice it to say Peaky Blinders is now my favorite show and a must watch.",2014
10,Its not often I give anything a 10/10 but Peaky Blinders is one of those exceptions............,2014
8,"This second season has exceeded its expectations and has brought more action, drama and suspense to our television sets. The creator Steven Knight has captured in my opinion one of the most realistic and exciting series available to date. The casting for Peaky Blinders is excellent and 'Tom Hardy is outstanding' his cockney accent and attitude is together funny and scary, along with top hat and cane his appearance is a statement in itself. Tom Hardy is recently becoming my new favourite actor from this and his fantastic performance as Ivan Lock in 'Locke', another accent changing role which he executes flawlessly. Another great performance in this season in particular is that of Sam Neil, who plays Inspector Chester Campbell, A manipulative police inspector with cruel intentions. He is despised by all due to his excellent acting in this role, you forget he is the once loved Dr. Alan Grant in Jurassic Park. Helen McCrory also gives a fantastic purpose to the series and gives a wonderful loving but stern performance, (a woman not to be crossed) with an impressive accent considering her well spoken voice. Not forgetting the Peaky Blinder Mr himself Cillian Murphy gives a attention gripping performance leaving you admire him but yet still fear him. there's nothing the Peaky Blinders wont do to become kings of Birmingham! I look forward to what the next season will bring, I'm hooked! 'To the Peaky Blinders'.",2014
10,"You find a ""television"" series once in a blue moon which blows your mind, and Peaky Blinders has accomplished that in my mind. As of this writing, I'm on S03/E06, which I think is the most well-written and explosive episodes of the series. It's also one of the most amazing series that I have seen. These seem more like mini-features, with almost a full hour of drama. By the time I started season three, I started saying aloud how I love Peaky Blinders and its characters. They thrive on a combination of excellent storytelling and photography. ""Breaking Bad"" is the only other series that I know which have become the platinum standard of any series that I know exist. I venture to believe that Blinders beats out Game of Thrones as well. The main reason why Thrones and Bad don't live up to what I've experienced with Blinders? The sheer boldness of how the show compels you to understand and even empathize with people who make a living out of doing just about everything illegal that they could ever muster, in a place where just about everyone seems to be about some kind of illegal activity. The complexities of the characters demand that everyone must sell who they are and I cannot for the life of me, find any character who is a ""weak link"" to the series. ",2016
10,"This is such a binge worthy show that I'm holding back the last couple episodes like slowing down before the last few chapters of my favorite book. I'm not ready for it to be over just yet. As someone else mentioned, this show is all about character. You can't help but root for the Shelby's, regardless of how horrible they are. There's a line in the first season, ""You are bad men, but you are our bad men."" Pretty much sums it up. ",2016

Not only is it beautifully shot, the cinematic shots draw you into the life's of the characters, putting you on a personal level with them, I was left felling disappointed every time it finished and eager for the next episode. Murphy delivers a fantastic performance , as if he was made for the roll, not to mention really suiting the period clothing !! The tension in the story line had me on the edge of my seat, I so wanted a happy ending....... Please make another series, loved ever second of every episode....... This will stick in my mind as friends in the north has for years to come. Brilliant.",2013

9,"""The Fall"" is a very well filmed and developed story. The acting of all the cast is accurate and right where it needs to be. No more, no less. ",2013
9,"This series had me gripped from start to finish, and I couldn't be happier that a second series has been green-lit. As a senior police officer leads the hunt for a serial killer in Belfast, we see the similarities in these two amoral protagonists. The story unfolds with an economy of scene structure which never omits important details; every scene drives the narrative, but it never feels unreal or stretches credulity. Beautifully paced, tension abounds with spine-tingling murder scenes. The characters are very well written, and played with pitch-perfect performances from the leads, Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Another reviewer on this strand didn't like the ending, but for me it was spot on. The story took the time to include complexities and unresolved events which are reflective of real life. Are we to castigate every TV show production team who leave a show on a cliffhanger ending to give them somewhere to go with the next series? If the next one carries the universally excellent production values of the first, then I for one can't wait.",2013
9,"I have really enjoyed the first 2 episodes. It is interesting, dark and detailed with real people and real issues. It unfolds slowly but surely but inevitably.",2013
7,"One more episode to go, odd time to write a review but I just cant wait to express how good this show is.",2013
9,"And note that both my nods to great crime thrillers were directed to British productions. The hunt for a serial killer gets a complicated but teeth-gnashing treatment in this beautifully produced series, The Fall. Gillian Anderson plays Stella Gibson, a focused, rather humorless, detective who takes control of the investigation once she ascertains that recent murders are indeed the work on one killer. She doesn't have to fight the battles that plagued Jane Tennyson, however. The male officers pretty much cede control and follow her lead & respect her authority and insight. But she is like Tennyson in that she's sacrificed the personal for the professional, indulging in the occasional ""sweet night"" to satisfy her sexual desires. ",2013
9,"Gillian Anderson is an excellent choice as lead detective in this series about her pursuit of a serial killer. The show also follows the life of the serial killer giving the audience an inside look that is rare and quite similar to Hannibal, but less dramatic in a good way. Ironically Gillian Anderson also has a prominent role in Hannibal as his personal Psychiatrist. I wish there were more shows like this on television, but I fear that the average person is more drawn to less sophisticated programming. At times it seems a bit slow, but the characters are so interesting it really doesn't bother me at all. I have yet to notice any glaring wholes in the writing and quite honestly the filming and cinematography is excellent! I pray this show is on for many more seasons to come, often though it is this type of show with all its perfection that gets cut short... let's keep our fingers crossed... they did at least get a 2nd Season.",2013
3,"I am not an expert on the UK's criminal justice system, but it seems to me that they know who the killer is, where he lives, and they see him multiple times. What more preponderance of evidence do they need? Every detail points to him, including a fingerprint on the murder weapon. Why do they not arrest him? This show is like a Law and Order SVU episode, but not as good and 10 hours long.",2015
10,"Well written, excellent cinematography, keeps you hooked and on the edge of your seat. Characters are complex, and not predictable, also developed as the plot develops. Certainly there are some details that are not believable, mistakes that you don't think a serial killer would make, but they are easily overcome because of the writing and character development, and th eeriness of the storyline. If you want a comparison, think of Dexter or The Killing. Not much humor in the daily on goings of the characters, Very dark and serious, don't know if that's more common in Irish series. But you certainly want to keep watching it.",2013
5,"Life is too short to indulge this new genre of TV in the style of The Killing where nothing happens, no one talks, there's virtually no plot, no suspense, no tension and strangely, for a police show, no actual police work. It's a 'thing' now called Slow TV. I didn't know it was a thing until I started reading the reviews of this, The Klling, Above the Lake, Peaky Blinders and other shows. The reviewers kept coming around to slowness and inactivity as a dazzling new thing not a defect. Like they all loved shaky cam for years and until every movie was a camera tied to a monkey on meth. We can call this KTV where the K is for Ketamine or Klonopin. Anyway as to The Fall it's a straightforward story of tough cop chasing madman but they took that story and wrapped it in hour after hour of mood and atmospherics. I put in 5 hrs of S1 and 1hr of S2 and stopped because another 5 hrs I could have watched my fireplace or caught up on reading. I could put that book down every 45 minutes pay attention for 5 minutes and be all caught up. Maybe that's the intent of KTV; background noise you sort of watch 5% of the time. Give it the briefest of your attention it won't matter. Morally ambiguous good will defeat morally ambiguous evil and so forth.",2015
2,"Gillian Anderson has got to be portraying the most irritating, bland, shallow, dislikeable and frankly dumb main protagonist I have ever seen in a series. The constant whispering and a never-changing facial expression are just pathetic and whilst I realise she is meant to portray a 'cold' character, it is definitely over done.",2017
1,"It went so well until the half of 2nd season. The start wasn't great either but it was good enough. Then , terribly written story. And the ending extremely bad. I really expected more after how it began. Very disappointed. The way they found everything on him - extremely bad. Why did he agree to give away rose location. I thought he has a plan or something - it was going that way. But shot him out of the blue, even that scene was bad directed. How can he get injured that bad although the detective was first on the line - to say so. Then he loses his memory and they find , just like that, another crime to charge him with and all other evidence on him. Like they won the lottery. Bad, very bad turn of events I was expecting something smarter.",2016
2,"It gets one extra star from me for being a well made (with one critical exception) good story, but easily loses the other 8 because the whole story (both series combined) could have been told in a four episode mini-series, in which it might have been entertaining. Every single scene was edited abominably – At least 80% of it should have been edited out, including a lot of entirely redundant scenes. The Fall isn't really entertaining; instead because it's too slow it's an assault on your free time that is barely intriguing enough to keep you watching (if you're unlucky). It just doesn't provide enough value for your time by a long long way. I wish that I'd never started watching and I'm only wasting my time reviewing it now through pure altruism in the hope that anyone reading this will think again about buying the boxed set.",2014
2,"I don't know why everyone gives high praise to this lame series; if the main purpose of it was to show Gillian Anderson's wardrobe and an unbelievably clownish incompetence of an entire police operation, then yes, it gets a 10 at that. More than half the show the police are made look like stupid monkeys by a serial killer which is not doing anything special to anticipate or outmaneuver them. It's not like the killer has an extremely elaborate plan or is playing with them; no! It's just that the police are scripted to be plain stupid! At one point they have found their main suspect and he is in close range to them, but they still let him stroll right under their noses without making the first move (and no, the cliché of ""let's leave him make his move so he takes us closer to where he is hiding the victim"" is not even well developed to justify that dumb approach).",2015
2,"I decided to watch ""The Fall"" for two reasons. First, after watching about a dozen or so similar American products, I was curious how the British could do it. Second, I used to be somewhat of a fan of X-Files and wanted to see how Gillian Anderson did it in her second series (the first after X-Files). Boy, was I disappointed...",2015
1,We know the formula for a modern TV show is that a white male always has to be the bad guy and the strong man-hating female lead has it in for him. Littered along the wreck of a plot there has to be female to female kissing etc etc.,2015
1,I suppose I felt guilty giving it one star. Soooo I watched it again with my laptop switched off. Okay ... TBF until the last episode it just about fell into the word entertainment with huge reservations.,2015
1,"Do not waste your time on this series unless you want to spend hours imagining that Ms Andersons acting will ever get better. The writing is awful in the last of the episodes year two and I feel watching paint dry would be comparable. There is no spoiler here because the whole series ends as a spoiled mess. What I wonder is what producers for year two were thinking after this ended because I can imagine it was contempt for their own work. Imagine watching someone holding on to a cliff and then everything goes black. This will give you a small glimpse of the entire show. The story year one was actually interesting if you take out a few actors, specifically one mentioned earlier in this review.",2015
6,"Love the show, but I don't think the writers are making these first new episodes in season 3 credible. Why no armed guards with Spector ? Why is Rose Stag not in a private room under guard ? Why would the they assign a nurse that resembles Spector's victims ? I do hate when they do that !!!! Stella is great as usual, thanks to Gillian Anderson's superb acting, but we need to get out of the hospital now. The writers seemed to have dropped the ball a bit so far, however, I will stay with it on the strength of Stella. I owe her that. I have marked this down from 9/10 for seasons 1 & 2. I do hope the momentum picks up as this progresses as this usually is a gripping drama.",2016
2,"The Fall is the most un-original, uninspiring show i'v seen in a long, long time.",2013
9,"Why a 9, well the last episode left me a bit upset (to say the least). This story was written with Gillian in mind for the main role, once she agreed then the writing took off & more episodes were generated. I have noticed that a lot of reviewers did not like this series, whats not to like. Gillian's character is so unassuming & has absolutely no idea what she is doing to the male characters around her.....or does she? Paul was so calculating & clever just what you want from a vicious serial killer with a unique sense of wrong & right that only applies to him. The cast is excellent & the graphic nature of the series really made me feel like it was written for an adult audience & not for the teenage population that so many drama's are written for. To end I will say this, the storyline may be done a million times before but this had so many layers it had me thinking & discussing the angles with my wife for days after. Well done to all involved for a staggering drama for adults.",2013
1,"After sitting through the first four installments of The Fall, I couldn't help feeling that this effort suffers from one of the key things wrong with television today. Someone comes up with a premise for a 60 or 90 minute ""Movie of the Week"" and then the Network Program Directors decide to stretch it out to five or six hours (or, even worse, a weekly series). Another good example of this was New Zealand's Top of the Lake with Elisabeth Moss. This one had me begging for infomercials. The Fall could have just as easily taken place in The Wax Museum. All the energy, so far, has taken place in the swimming pool! I don't know if it was the Director or the Actors or a bad sound crew, but all the whispery, sibilant dialogue has been like fingernails on a blackboard. All in all, this could have been a mediocre episode of Silent Witness.",2013
6,I would've rated this show with a 8 or 9 in the first place.,2017
10,"It is very rare that you have a near perfect episode, especially of a series on commercial television. But FX has done it here with The Americans. It is nearly flawless. Great mind candy for the thinking person, with something to come back to after the first viewing. I credit the success of The Americans to 3 things: Great script, great music, and Matthew Rhys.",2013
9,I don't want to repeat everything that has been already said about this series.,2013
10,"I'm not going to spoil any of the episodes so read on. I'm just saying I've been waiting for years for a television series that sets the hook and does not let you go. Very intense, great social issues, Keri Russell is spectacular. I just started ""Nashville"" the series this year and thought that was the answer, but ""The Americans"" has bumped Nashville down to number 2. Some of the younger crowd who does not know the 80's, or the cold war between the USSR and the US, might not feel the intensity compared to us who felt the tension of the time - when WWIII felt on the doorstep. The first ten minutes of the series opener was the best ten minutes of any television series opener in history. The pounding music, the action, the mystery, the excitement was unbelievable. I just hope the writers can keep it going for the next ten years.",2013
9,"Who doesn't love a cold war drama set in the early days of the Reagan administration about deep cover KGB spies posing as a wholesome ""all American"" family living in a DC suburb? And in a perverted twist of fate, next door to the FBI counter-intelligence agent tracking these rumored agents, who exist primarily as mere urban legends in the paranoid imaginations of overly-thinking spooks. Needless to say, they ARE real and even more deeply rooted in Mom and Apple Pie than their believers would think possible. Not just disguised infiltrators, but perfect replicas of the Sears portrait American family in a simulacrum America as imagined by a Soviet espionage agency. That is to say 'Mom' and 'Dad' carry out often brutal espionage missions against the enemies of their Soviet homeland on American turf, while raising their 'American' kids, often with the unintended sit-com inducing results inherent in trying to maintain harsh Soviet-style discipline while pretending to be the indulgent and ""decadent"" parental units of innately suspicious, wise beyond their years 'tweens. Their situation is further complicated by a newly sworn-in US president with a more aggressive, anti-Soviet foreign policy, and their newly appointed handler ""Claudia"" - a matronly old Stalinist whom neither trust, and who will test the limits of their loyalties with far reaching consequences. ",2013
9,"It is early days yet, but the pilot was so engrossing (and Fox infuriating with its endless barrage of commercial breaks), it deserved a review.",2013
8,"I had not even heard of this show but by chance, saw an ad for it an hour before the pilot so I thought what the heck, and watched it. I was pleasantly surprised, I really enjoyed it, much more so than I thought I would. It was not perfect as some reviewers pointed out, but for a pilot working out the kinks, I thought it was exceptionally well done. I love the concept of doing this show back in the 1980's when the ""Soviet Empire"" was doing everything it could to keep up with America in regards to technology, arms, etc. What better way to collect intel than to have ""sleeper agents"" embedded in American society for the long haul? I plan on catching this show on a regular basis and see where they run with it.",2013
10,"What a great show this is. In stead of going for the 'fighting the bad guys' routine this show follows in the footsteps of great shows like Dexter/Breaking Bad or the Sopranos, where you find yourself supporting the bad guys and even rooting for them to win.",2013
9,I picked this up quite accidentally.. And i had absolutely no idea about the cast and anything else beside the tagline here on IMDb.,2013
5,"Its starting to take its toll with me. Unfortunately, this is typical with all long playing shows. The writers and the network get all caught up with the earlier rave reviews, so it seems that they like to drag it out. They should quit while they were ahead. It no longer has the suspense that I had felt at the beginning. The only thing left is to wonder what the writers have in store for the two leads. Do they turn turncoat, or are they arrested. I read that the fifth season would be the last and i hope that is true. The two leads are showing remorse over killing an innocent man who was only doing good for the entire world. Where were their remorse in the earlier shows when they were killing innocent people cause they were 'their' enemy...period.",2017
1,"I don't normally review, well, anything...but i still can't believe how horrible season 5 of this show is, especially after the first four seasons were fantastic. I had to check twice that episode 13 is really the season's finale as it just cannot end like this. Watching paint dry may be more interesting than what this show has become.",2017
10,"This show is very different and engaging! Love the choice of actors - Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys. They are doing an excellent job, great play! If you really are following the show close you'll get addicted!I love Keri Russell as a bad ass Russian spy! And Matthew Rhys is so sexy! They are a great on-screen couple and a team. Lies, spying, sex, intrigues you get the whole package!! The show is solid! You would enjoy the tension, the spy games, the chemistry between Elizabeth and Phillip, KGB spies, who actually start as pretending to be the perfect ""american"" family and then they actually realize they really love each other and between their spy missions they are trying to build their trust and love.",2013
3,"Initially this show had some decent intrigue. Some steamy sexuality. Some genuine suspense. And some interesting story telling. However, from the minute they introduced the Paige/Pastor Tim story arc the show went straight into the crapper. I have never seen a worse actress than Holly Taylor. Granted, it doesn't help that her character has to be the dumbest, whiniest teenager to ever walk this earth. (And that includes any teenager who has ever appeared in a slasher movie.) But even taking that into account, she is simply unbearable. And week after week she grinds the show to a painful, miserable halt. The show has completely devolved into a bad soap opera, with no merit whatsoever. ",2017
1,"I have watched 4 episodes of this program and to be honest every one got more unbelievable than the one before. With blabbermouth, bungling, fumbling FBI agents giving every scrap of sensitive information to strangers and next door neighbors whilst the Soviet spies need no sleep, spending every night out murdering the opposition of getting their hands on the USA's secrets. I can't take it seriously. The reality is that in the 1980s (this is the time line of the series)the Soviet Union didn't really have much US secret information, in fact just the opposite, they became paranoid, convinced the US was preparing a nuclear attack at any moment. Google the name Stanislav Petrov it will give you a good idea of what the true situation was. It's well acted and the sets are very good but it's no true reflection of the 1980s spy game.",2013
7,"I served 2 years in Soviet Army. The military uniform worn by Soviet KGB General is laughable. Absolutely horribly wrong! Generals did not wear boots in the office, regalia is wrong, haircut unseen in Soviet military. I was laughing so hard during the scene in Moscow KGB office. It's a caricature of a high ranking Soviet officer. I did not expect a complete correctness in depiction of Soviet realities but some of what I've seen was poorly done. Everyithing goes for naive American audience. I haven't missed a single episode yet because it is intriguing. I'd prefer to be focused on on the content. But when I saw scenes that supposedly took place in Moscow, listened to the conversations in Russian then I got an impression that authors cared about overall impression without paying much attention to details.",2013
9,I came into this show 14 minutes late and did not get up from my seat!! For a pilot this was an intense intro with just enough back story to keep you interested and not too much to kick you back.,2013
1,"Just wanted to remind you that this show has nothing in common with objective reality and is merely a product of stereotypes about USSR. Don't be delusional. It is like all this list of action movies about Russia - new Die Hard, new Mission Impossible, something more. This new movies are as far from objectiveness as the cold war ones were. More smooth, they indeed are, yet far from truth. There was a tradition to make Russian either bad guys or just stupid. In recent films and here there is a new trend - to say that Russians want to be Americans in the core of their heart. Don't wanna start a holywar in here - just remember that it's nothing but a fiction. I hoped it would be something more.",2013
1,"After a weak 2013 start I still held out hope this show eventually would find its legs and be a winner. Instead, at the end of the show's third season I found myself unfulfilled and asking in the words of the Peggy Lee standard, is that all there is? ",2015
2,"I liked the first few episodes of The Americans. They had the right mix of ingredients: Action, Espionage, Sex, Love, etc. But after watching the whole first season, I got turned off more and more by the unrealistic and lazy writing and decisions. Why did the Russians ever lose the cold war if they were able to churn out unbeatable and undetectable super spies like this? How did the Americans ever come out of the cold war ahead if they are so unbelievably inept and storm trooper like stupid? I guess wigs and glasses are such perfect disguises that during the 80s nobody was able to see through superficial changes on a person. It is painful to watch how the actors have to avoid the natural instinct to touch their partners hair when he is in disguise. How can a woman go through months of relationship and finally marriage without ever touching a man's hair (and thus blowing this whole set-up)? Throughout the whole series it is being kept alive by the god-like abilities and intuition of the Soviet spies and the stupidity and ineptness of the FBI. All in all way too unrealistic to enjoy for more than a few episodes.",2014
3,"The 3 rating is for Season Five- prior to this sleeper of a season I rated the series a strong 8. The Americans was one of the very few series that had been worth watching each week and looking forward to the next season. Vikings, GoT, Fargo and Saul are the only other current series I feel are in the same category. Sadly The Americans has suffered a severe decline in story line with the gross overemphasis of the Paige character. Paige's constant whining has dragged the series down and making her story central has substantially degraded the quality of the series. With any luck at all the season will end with Paige meeting an unfortunate demise which will then allow the series to get back on track. There has been little plot movement over this season. I hope the series gets back on track by focusing away from an extraordinarily boring character.",2017
3,"This show's totally unbelievable, no way it deserves the high rating it has. Soviet spies, back in the day, were suppose to be the best in the world you know? I mean they were able to steal the technology for nuclear weapons pretty much as soon the US finished the Manhattan project. No country has ever had an espionage coup that big. I've read the KGB even had one of their guys working as the HEAD of FBI counter intelligence right up to the nineties! But in this show the Soviet spies are like trigger happy morons. These people, they kill their own agents at the drop of a hat. They shoot people on the street in broad daylight. Blow up cars, houses, kill police, FBI agents. Why is it real life Soviet spies were undetected for long? Its because they DIDN'T do all that stuff. Good god the spies on the show are even worse than James Bond.",2015
3,"I started watching with the knowledge of the high IMDb score and the DVD cover design that is up to par, great was my disappointment when I fell into a crossing between Days of our lives and a vague subtraction of Nikita set in the 80's.",2013
2,"If you are willing to dumb yourself down and ignore gaping story/plot holes that make no sense, then perhaps this show is for you... if you demand realism and factual rigor from a show then I would recommend passing on this show.",2013
10,"Reign is a show aimed at girls, there's no arguing about that. It's fiction, doesn't claim to be otherwise. ",2015
7,"Some parts of this are way too painful to watch. I began watching it because I love Mary, Queen of Scots, but soon found that the historical accuracy of this was blown way out of proportion. Clothing (especially the dresses) - WRONG. Food - WRONG. Dance style - WRONG. Names of Mary's friends - WRONG. It seemed like I had a permanent grimace on my face for the beginning of it.",2013
2,"If you're going to make an historical series at least get it accurate. I've never seen so much rubbish. It soon devolves from a reasonably good start to a sexed up teen sojourn that has only the thinnest plot to do with Mary Queen of Scots. Typical American bastardised brainless fodder that they churn out to the dullards who rate it a ten. I'm not going point out the glaring mistakes, there's too many and it's all too tedious. ",2013
6,"I'll start by saying I'm Scottish with a reasonable knowledge of the times in the drama and this is bunkum BUT it is enjoyable bunkum with a very beautiful Mary and some of the best music I've heard on a TV show since the new Battlestar Galactica. Think 'The Borgia's' without Jeremy Iron's pope and you will be on the right lines when you imagine what 'Reign' is like. It's actually so pretty, and the music is so great, that I really want them to dump the historical narrative altogether and disappear off into a fantasy world where they can make up their own ending and create their own marriages and alliances as they go along. Adelaide Kane is a gorgeous Mary - in fact I keep forgetting it's supposed to be Mary Queen of Scots and getting confused with 'Snow White'. That girl was just born to wear red roses in her hair. Her young French prince is the ringer for the younger of the Borgia sons and is very easy on the eye - and talking about eyes, the 'bastard' brother to the French prince is another honey. And then we get on to the pagans in the woods, the conspiring Queen and the enemies all around. It's quite sumptuous. As I say, it's nonsense; it's absolutely not to be taken seriously, but I will carry on watching it because it is all just so darned enjoyable and glorious in it's wrongness. And the soundtrack is just breathtaking.",2013
1,"Having seen the beauty of THE TUDORS and the WHITE QUEEN ,and other similar historical dramas, I was looking forward to this account of Mary , Queen of Scots. I was disappointed within 5 minutes but sat through this drivel for the entire Pilot so I could give at least an objective critic. Let me say I enjoy a wee bit of creativity, and flexibility with historical ""facts"" but this is beyond that and has made a fairy tale story for the TV . If I was an American teenage girl I would probably love this ,but I am a middle aged English man who enjoys his history to be based on history and not some fantasy tale with overtones of some teen romance which seems to dominate TV these days , I was waiting for the vampire to appear. I was cringing the entire 45 minutes and this will be the last I see of this series. I really wanted to enjoy this , but the costumes and modern music just took all the enjoyment away and devalued such a fantastic story. They could of had Scottish music at the dance, even a modern take of Scottish , but instead ....",2014
1,"Really? I watched this hoping that it would be a class show. Instead, it's pure drivel. The characters are lifeless and I question its accuracy. Based upon others' reviews, other than the names, there is nothing historical about this show; not the wardrobe, not the music, and apparently according to what I've read, not even some of the intrigue.",2013
8,"People complained incessantly about the ""historical inaccuracy"" of A Knight's Tale, too. No, they absolutely didn't play Queen at jousting matches in those days or dance to David Bowie, and the young princess probably wouldn't have worn see-through dresses and post-modern hats. Heath Ledger's character wouldn't have been able to pose as a knight. You guys, it's a FANTASY! It's historical FICTION. It's not a documentary!! I loved A Knight's Tale and I love this show so far. It moves a little slowly, but it's GORGEOUS and I love the modern take on the 1550's. I love the hair, and the makeup, and the music! I think all of the elements blend together well and I'm totally hooked. I'll be really interested to see where they take it, and I love the characters. I love the mix of old and new, and the mix of fact and fiction. All in all, I think it's stellar! Again: it's NOT A DOCUMENTARY, people. It's a TV show. And a very pretty one.",2013
1,"Reign feels like a well-funded high school production, which makes a sad sort of TV-land sense, since high school girls are obviously its intended audience. This oh-so-twee tale of the young Mary Queen of Scots got the country, France, and the century, the 16th, right. After that, you are on your own. Four or more times every episode, the sound track inexplicably blares out a pop tune. It's like having Barry Manilow suddenly pop up in the middle of ""Game of Thrones."" Ugh. The only thing missing to make the disaster complete: vampires. Maybe they can sneak one or two in during the pop songs. Many reviewers argue that Reign is historical fiction. They're half right. It's fiction. If they are going to do something this many parsecs from reality, why not use purely fictional characters, rather than drag history into an alley and beat it beyond recognition?",2013
6,"This show is not historically accurate at all. The costumes are modernized. The accents are painfully inaccurate. If you are looking for a show to learn about Mary, Queen of Scots, move along.",2013
3,I was intrigued and excited by the ads running up to the debut of this series. The first few minutes of the initial episode promised historical authenticity. It quickly veered into a disappointingly predictable teen soap opera. ,2014
1,"All the ingredients were there. Decent costumes,decent sets,fair script and good quality camera work. However, the director simply could not decide which direction he wanted to go. Whether to make it a modern take on a historical theme or make it an authentic period drama. So, he decided to mix both. This obviously failed. It is a series which will appeal to teenage girls, due to the fact that the female cast (teenage girls) act like modern teenage girls, to such a degree that I was expecting to see an iPad appear and or see them texting. The incredibly irritating background music is present for most of the episode, and a lot of the time it is a competition between the dialogue and the music, meaning that some of the dialogue cannot be heard. It had great possibilities, under better direction, but sadly the opportunity was missed.",2013
2,"If you are a teenage girl who is interested in watching a grown up Disney Princess movie, then this show is for you.",2014
10,"This year season was absolutely fantastic. This is the BEST program by far. Already sad to see this season coming to end. The cast collectively have created such a wonderful program. The story line in every weekly show had enough drama, intrigue and suspense. The final scene clearly complemented the seasons turmoil by having Francis and Mary back together. However, the thought of King Francis dying saddens me already...but absolutely willing to wait and see. Now the future storyline with Catherine and Queen Elizabeth to attack Mary is devious and can't wait for the season to return...hoping it includes a miracle for King Francis to continue forever. Best, Best, Best show !!!!!",2015
8,"I have read a lot of reviews complaining about the show being 'historically inaccurate' or something along those lines ,and while they are most definitely correct in saying so, one has to understand that that is not what the show is trying to be. It started off as a fun, sexy and unusually compelling take on a age old story. Girl meets boy, boy and girl fall in love, politics and vaguely supernatural elements try to keep them apart. Yet recently this show, courtesy of its fantastic writers and cast, has become so much more. The plot lines range from political to personal with the cast doing a amazing job of making the tension seem real. You will not believe how easily you will become invested into this show and keep on coming back for more. This is a really good show, with some of the most talented young actors out there and a beautiful backdrop for all their intrigue, that just happens to be set in 15th century France. Definitely watch this show because it is wholly entertaining and leaves you wanting more.",2014
1,I would give Reign negative stars if I could.,2014
2,"I was very keen to watch this as it has such a high score on IMDb.I gave it a try. I barely made it through the pilot. I wanted to like this, because I love period dramas. Unfortunately I couldn't get over the dyed hair of Mary's ladies. The dialog is stiff and so cliché. All the young actors look like they are from a teen magazine cover. And when the dresses appeared to be purchased from a prom dress shop, was to much to bare for me. If I didn't saw any authentic period dramas before like those from BBC for instance, I guess I would have been able to appreciate this movie. Maybe if you see this as a fairy tale, you can enjoy it. But I was looking for something meaningful.",2013
10,"It's been three days later and I'm still obsessing over the premiere of Reign. I recorded it with my DVR and I've watched it three times. It's romantic, mysterious, and the characters are so perfectly imperfect. It's sad because the ratings weren't as high as NBC would have liked, and I'm scared that this show will be over long before I'm ready. No, logistically, this show doesn't make sense, and it's not that historically accurate, but it's so addictive that I'm impatiently waiting for Thursday to come again. I can't remember the last time a show has captivated me so completely. I pray that this show survives. I love the idea that hints at a love triangle and the drama that unfolds in the lives of Mary's ladies in waiting. I NEED THIS SHOW TO SURVIVE. I' haven't been this excited to watch a new show since The Vampire Diaries first aired on the CW.",2013
10,"I have watched all episodes from the beginning and I absolutely LOVE this show! It is NOT Historically correct and I am thankful for that. If I wanted History I would watch the History Channel. I adore all the twists and turns. I fell in Love with Mary and Francis. Only thing I do not like is when Conde came in and with events that happened..stole Marys heart. I am keeping faith this will Not last!! We the Faithful are hoping the writers continue the love story that made us addicted. You will LOVE this Show. Trust me. Long Live Reign Long Live Frary!! Looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us next. It is on season 2, so you need to catch up if you haven't already.",2015
1,"What a piece of really really bad horrible inaccurate piece of crap. There is nothing right here. Mary was never raised in a convent, she lived in the French court. They cant even get the color of her hair correct! The French royals were not her enemies, she was one of them. Francis was younger then her and sickly. Her ladies were ALL named Mary, whats this Lola, Greer business? Couldn't even get styles right. I don't think they wore high school prom dresses back then! Pretty modern looking interiors! WHAT is with the music? I guess trying to hide how bad this show is? Virginal girls would have never been allowed to watch a royal bedding. WHY do the French court all have English accents? I get this show is geared towards young girls. What a shame that so many are going to watch this and come away with the idea they watched history. Added comment, I see that this was filmed in Ireland. Well that explains the reason why the castle looks old and crumbling. Back in the 1500s they Weren't! Also they would look more French. Since it was in France!",2013
8,"When Reign won this year's peoples choice award as a new drama series, I was bit curious about it. I watched few random episodes on TV and it captured my full attention. Then suddenly I got the extraordinary opportunity to watch the complete First Season from my friend,Shathi.She gave her DVDs and now I am totally into it. I am always an admirer of historical drama since Troy and it eventually get more stronger by kingdom of heaven, The Tudor and Game of thrones. Reign is elegantly different in its story telling and plot twist. It has a nice mix of castle conspiracy but in the end suppressed with such a nice romantic tale.",2014
1,"Really wanted to like this one. But absolutely nothing good about this. Bad acting, bad costumes, bad script, other than characters' names, no connection to actual history. Watch the Borgias or Da Vinci's Deamons for a costume / historical drama with modern updates -- this is one hour I'll never get back! ",2013
1,"listen this series has turned out to be the most stupid and not understandable series that I have ever seen. Why would you put up so many unlucky couples, why put them up and break them up afterwords? why let Mary marry Francis than after that is done you show us that Francis is gonna die. Are you f kidding me? It doesn't even make sense. Make Bash watch while his ""girlfriend that left him for 10 minutes ago"" has sex with his f brother? Why? This series has gotten so f up that I got so mad and grossed out at. I know that series gotta have these romances and interesting stuff going on but you are doing it all wrong. I mean I'm done with it. Just wanted to let you know that you makers f it up. The actors are good tho",2014

9,"I am pretty picky when it comes to television shows... and I actually really enjoy this one. It isn't my favorite, but it's definitely a lot better than expected! It's certainly on the DVR list.",2013
10,"I really don't have time to be hooked on another TV show, but I'm sucked in. This is very suspenseful - I have not been bored for a moment. I really like the addition of Dylan. He adds some edge to the show, although it's already pretty gripping. I really thought this would just be some gore-fest - it's not (although there are some grisly scenes). It really is intriguing - the family dynamics and characters. I look forward to more. I loved Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground and Orphan - I will check out more of her work. She is very versatile - a fine actress. I am not familiar with the others, but they are pretty awesome, too.",2013
10,"Now, I had my doubts, for Psycho was one of the best horror movies ever to be made, and making a prequel show could ruin it all. But, my doubts proved to be fortunately wrong. The story centers around young Norman Bates, who's just moved to a small Bay Area town with his mother Norma Bates. It is set in the modern world, so that's why I had to rack a point off, but who cares. It is absolutely amazing. Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore lead an all stellar cast into the world of serial murder, cover ups, and horrific betrayal that can only go so unimaginably high. With shocks and gasps, and the kind of suspense that makes you clench your teeth, Bates Motel is definitely a must watch. If you haven't see this show yet, go on to channel 46 and start watching because it will grip you, and it won't let go.",2013
8,"I know this show is clicking because my 21 year old son squirms through out the show in total discomfort over the Norma and Norman relationship. He wanted to dump the show after the first episode but came back for the second. I'm sure he'll be back, almost against his will, for the rest. The main actors, Vera Farmiga as Norma and Freddie Highmore as Norman are spot on perfect. They have the look for sure, but more importantly, they have the psychology down perfect. Things are played in such a way that that mother/son kiss could be construed as normal, innocent affection, but you know damn well that something is wrong and getting wronger. There's a lot of story going on in this show -- a lot of mysteries to keep you hooked. Highly recommended.",2013
9,"Watch it,that is all that needs to said about this series.It has got decent actors,great pacing it has the makings to become one of my favourite shows.I can not wait for the next episode,i have watched three and they have all been very good i would rate this as a nine out of ten.I was not expecting it to be this good.I am not going to say to much as i don't want to spoil it.There are some shocking moments so remember that it has a horror theme and is very violent in places.They have gone all out with good actors i knew all of them from good films and series.The guy who plays the legendary Norman Bates does it perfectly,he even looks like him from certain angles,the mother plays the part very well i cant pick a bad fault about any of the actors.The story has me hooked,i know this is going to be good all the way to the end.",2013
10,"I'm not sure the age range of the ""reviews"" written by a view of these people, but I must say they are way off about this show. I went into this series with high hopes. I knew Norma and Norman's relationship would be deeply explored, and that's what drew me in. I however was not expecting there to be so much intriguing mystery surrounding the little community they find themselves in. The casting is top notch, I honestly don't think they could have picked a better actress for Norma. ",2013
10,"Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho 1960) was a suspenseful and frightening film about Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his dead Mother. The Bates Motel TV SHOW takes the story to a whole new level. It it is a prequel to the movie, about Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his mother, Norma Louise Bates (Vera Farmiga). Freddie Highmore and Vera Farmiga give an excellent performance in their roles. There are many other added features to the show including characters that are connected to the Bates family. I would recommend watching this show if you haven't seen it yet. Please see it from the beginning. There are many new twists in the story. I believe any Alfred Hitchcock fan would be excited to see this show. If you are a horror fan, watch this upcoming season!",2013
8,"The last thing I like to do is watching a series. I prefer films. Ended stories. However I could not resist watching the first episode of this idea of a nowadays prequel which is to explain how Norman Bates could become like he did in the classic Hitchcock movie Psycho. A strange, but still kind of compelling idea.",2013
9,"An avid fan of Hitchcock, I thought this pilot was well done. Though, it was interesting to see an iPhone ring in Mother's house, being this is set in the modern day. Olivia Hussey left some big shoes to fill after her portrayal of Norma Bates, but I think (given this pilot) Vera Farmiga was well cast by the producers. ",2013
8,"I wasn't expecting much from this series but a combination of good cast and fun episodes makes me look forward to this series on Mondays, right after The Following :D. The two main characters also are fantastic in the show. Freddie Highmore is always great in his roles and he even looks like a younger Norman. He puts on a very believable, soon to be psycho, Norman bates. And of course Verga Farmiga is also great as the overprotective mother.",2013
10,"So how do you improve on perfection? Answer: You don't! You just do something DIFFERENT while still remaining faithful to the core facets of the perfect entity. THAT is what this amazing new TV series Bates Motel (2013) does in ""re-imagining"" the classic 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film ""Psycho"". I regard ""Psycho"" as not only the GREATEST horror film of all time, but also as one of the BEST films of all time. It's in my personal top 5 all-time movies based on direction, writing, acting, influence, and staying power. It still to this day holds up immensely well to repeat viewing. I'm utterly fascinated by that genius film. So who would have ever thought that ANY potential remake/reboot/prequel, whatever you want to call it, could possibly live up to such an all-time, highly touted classic? Not me!",2013
6,"I have to say I was so excited about this show until the trailer showed Norman listening to Ipod. I'm pretty sure in that short amount of time Alfred Hitchcock found a way to roll over in his grave...twice. Being a fan of the movie I'm really disappointed in the direction the show is heading in and all the differences surrounding it: 1) the motel is by the sea, not in Arizona 2) Norma, mother, is nothing like what was described of her and her inspiration to buy the hotel was completely different 3) Norman goes back and forth from mama's boy to rebellious teen which considering the character I don't think fits him at all and various other reasons that are too numerous to explain. The time period really throws me off to, why in the world was this set in present times? It makes no sense but I do find it interesting that Norma and Norman seem like they are from another time entirely like they both just popped out of the early 60's, it's very strange. Maybe it's to make them seem like they're a world apart from every one else? It really clashes way to much for the general setting of the story. As much as I want to like this prequel to Psycho I think A&E dropped the ball a little. The story is not quite there all the way but it does have that curiosity that keeps you watching. I'm going to give this more time but for certain this will never live up to Psycho in any possible way.",2013
4,"There's just way too much wrong with the logic of this show for me to forgive. They've failed to build the Mother, son relationship like it should be. Norman's mother isn't as controlling as she should be. Norman having a brother takes away leaps and bounds from the, momma's boy, only child that Norman should be.",2013
9,"Watching the pilot, without any inclination of what it was about, was not the best idea. The angles, sets, and design were great, really setting a great theme for the show. But my question throughout the whole thing was ""What is this even about?"" After watching the pilot, I looked up synopsis of the show online, and once I knew what it was about, I enjoyed it a lot more. It is a great prequel to Psycho, the acting, though shaky at times, was overall very good. Freddie Highmore makes a great Norman Bates, as his acting makes you believe in his quiet, reserved, and rather strange character. Vera Farmiga also makes the story come alive with her acting, portraying a character who is both protective and comforting, while at the same time being quite a creep!",2013
1,"This could have been a wonderful opportunity to augment the classic horror movie psycho with a bit of backstory about Norman Bates, however, it really has fallen flat HARD. All we could take was the first 8 or so episodes before the useless plot lines, failing script, and poor character development grabbed a hold and forced us to shut the thing off. SPOILERS**For example, why ever was there an Asian underground sex trafficking ring being peddled by the police in this town? Why are there pot fields as far as the eye can see? Why is that girl afflicted with CF solving crimes? What the hell is happening in this town??! Isn't it supposed to be about the creation and early life of a deranged killer? It seems like Norman isn't even that troubled of a kid but rather the product of his bad up environment. Why does Norman have a brother even? His role is utterly worthless and forces teenage normalcy into what should be an increasingly terrifying connection between Norman and his Mother. The relationship between Norma and Norman SHOULD BE the focus of this series and it just isn't by any stretch. ",2016
1,This is good - - ,2013
3,"You know how everyone hated Hayden Christensen's acting in ""Attack of the Clones?"" Well, imagine all the worst scenes of that movie (mainly the ones between Anakin and Padme) and those are the type of scenes that fill this show.",2014
1,"When I look at the genre of this series on the main page, it says this series is a Drama | Horror | Mystery | Thriller. However it doesn't seem so at all. I think the proper genre for this should have been teen drama/ romance.",2016
3,"Sure the show is good, but it isn't the Psycho I know and love. Psycho remains one of my favorite horror films ever but this ruins the movies. It's suppose to be young Norman Bates but it is modern times, it takes place in an Oregon seaside town, not California, so this has little to do with the movies. And also what is up with the teenage girls in this show, have they seen another boy before? It is a clever remake of the movies but is no where near a prequel to the movies,if you want this aspect of the movie watch Psycho 4. If the show took place in the correct time period and correct location I would really like this show, I am not even sure I will continue to watch. If you never seen any of the movies then go ahead and watch but if you are a Psycho fan I can not see how any of you are liking this show.",2014
6,"Norma Bates was last portrayed in a cellar as a skeletal corpse. I really like who they had cast for Norman's mother, she's gorgeous. Besides that the actor who plays young Norman resembles Anthony Perkins character in the original, he's certainly showing a lot of his mannerisms, his nervousness and separation from people and only trying to please ""mother"".",2013
7,This modernized Prequel tries to be a lot of things. One gets the feeling from the first two episodes that the town and the townies will be more diabolical than a one on one butcher knife killer. ,2013
7,"The premise of this show did not sell me at first since it is an updated version of what the psycho of ""Psycho"" would be except it takes place in our time with Ipods and smart phones. This is the only stupid aspect of the show because it doesn't make any sense. Once you get past that anachronism the show takes off.",2013
3,"When I saw the promo for 'Bates Motel' I was immediately intrigued but knew I wouldn't have time to watch it as it aired. I found some free time and just finished watching season 1 and have found a new interesting show in TV, high quality taking away from the overall appeal. A few episodes in, I knew this show was doing a very good job at telling the Bates story, yet I found myself much less engaged than I would have expected. A few more episodes in, and it was more of the same. It wasn't until the 8th episode that I was able to put my finger on the problem. Unfortunately, the show seems to be(come) ""The Goonies in Psycho-town""... Will it keep its teenage storyline (almost smallvillesque) or will it grow out of it and get darker? I fell asleep.",2014
9,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.",2013
5,"This movie is NOT rated ""R"" but rather ""NC-17"" if not ""X"" rated. I got tired and almost fell asleep a some parts. About half of the movie is nothing more then them drinking, partying, and doing drugs. Literally. Also a bunch of pornography. It's like a college gone crazy for half of the movie (you see like 40+ boobies, a bunch of sex scenes, and a few shorts glimpse of a penis AND vagina)I got so excessive everyone I went with debated on leaving...",2013
8,The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.,2014
1,Martin Scorsese could have created a Real Movie about Real Characters who committed terrible acts on Wall Stree. Instead he chose to create a comedy farce for the sole purpose of a box office hit in order to generate tons of cash just like the character Belfort. There is no mention of the victims of Belfort's scams. I cannot believe he has been nominated for Best Director for this piece of Trash. I don't understand how this movie received 8.7 on IMDb.,2014

9,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.",2013
2,Dear Hollywood: It's time for something new.,2014

1,"Even though Jordan Belfort is a convicted con man, Scorsese & DiCaprio were apparently too dense to realize that his book was yet another of his scams. They leapt on Belfort's book like pigs on a pile of slop and thought everyone would be just as enamored as they were with the alleged life story of a sociopathic, sleazeball swindler. One example of how they got conned: In real life, Belfort never warned his cohorts that he was wearing a wire! In reality, he was a cry-baby snitch who immediately agreed to testify against his co-conspirators, never giving any of them a word of warning. ",2014
9,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen.

1,"The title of my review says it all. The Wolf of Wall Street was literally the WORST movie I have seen in my entire life. My opinion might not be quite so negative if the movie hadn't dragged its disorganized, rambling plot on for THREE WHOLE HOURS. At about the one hour mark I was already checking the clock out of boredom and disinterest, and continued to do so throughout the rest of the movie.",2014
1,It's hard to find the words to explain how TRULY AWFUL this film is. I'll try to do a list:,2014
8,"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.",2014
1,I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. Wolf of wall street does last 3 hours but there no shadow of a good reason for it. It could have lasted 1 hour and it would have been already too long.,2014
1,"De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.",2013
9,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.",2013
3,Wolf is a waste unless you are a 19-year-old boy who thinks Napoleon Dynamite was funny. Sex without passion. Drugs without end. Scenes without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the board.,2013
1,"Martin Scorsese scores a huge hit in this seminal celebration of human piggishness, rot and squalor. Sure one will face daunting challenges to self-indulgence, but if he tries hard enough and stays the course in dissipation and exploitation, he can become a King like Jordan Belfort, with a fawning, obsequious following.

10,"Allison Janney made me do something I had never done before. To be devotedly attached to a sit-com. She has created a character in Mom that it's bloody irresistible. An awful mother that it's impossible not to love. That's only achievable if the actress playing her is a genius. Anna Faris playing her daughter is a total find for me. Wonderful and a perfect foil for Allison Janney who reminds me of some of my favorites from the past, Kay Kendall, Eve Arden, Mary Astor, Joyce Grenfell and at the same time, she's like nobody else. She had only one moment in Primary Colors but she's memorable and has an entrance in The Hours that took my breath away. I want to see her in a movie that showcases her extraordinary talents to the fullest. Is that too much to ask?",2017
10,I am a little biased here. I am in recovery. Sober for 20 years now. Everyday I am very grateful that I survived. I don't take my life for granted anymore. So when I herd about this show I had to watch. As soon as I was done was episode 1 I was the shows #1 fan.,2017
10,I have to say first off I have always loved Anna Farris from the scary movie series and she does not disappoint in this sitcom at all. All these people saying that this show is negative and trashy are the same people that love two and a half men and watch it faithfully. I have laughed through every episode so far and can't wait to see how the whole series turns out. The woman who plays Anna Farris's mom is so funny and it kind of reminds you of the mother on two and half men. Don't listen to what other people say and watch for yourself before you make a judgment call. I see other shows that have a good rating like we're the millers which has no laughs in it whatsoever. We live in a generation where people see one thing they don't like an all of sudden everything about the show is bad.,2013
10,"I LOVE this show. A 7 rating overall is far too low for this great show. First of all, the gorgeous Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Bonnie. She really never fails to make me laugh. Her character is so lovably messed up. ",2015
9,"I absolutely LOVE this show! The actors and actresses do a wonderful job at keeping you laughing! I admit, the first 2 episodes were slow on the laughs, but as the story progresses, it gets funnier and funnier. I recommend this show to anyone who loved Two and Half Men and love to laugh. Both Ana Faris and Allison Janney have great chemistry and it works for this show! They are easy to relate to. Being a single mom of a teen and a boy growing up, while working hard to pay the bills and turn around your life whilst having a crazy mom in the mix! The actors who play the teen and kid also do a great job. All in all the whole show is good. You have cameos that come in. Who doesn't miss French Stewart? He is in this show and he makes for even more laughs! All in all, this show is great and if you are looking for some laughs and see the awesome chemistry with everyone on this show, then this is the one for you!",2014

10,"It's not easy to make a story of a dysfunctional family truly funny without making the characters dumb and ""over-the-top,"" but this show not only succeeds, it has gone through two seasons so far without losing any of its quality. It's a bit racy in spots but never gets crude (like 2-1/2 Men) or cheerfully dumb (Big Bang Theory and most other sitcoms), but even mixes in some pathos without affecting the basic humor. I haven't seen that ability since ""Frasier"". The cast, led by Anna Faris and Allison Janney, is uniformly excellent, with only French Stewart's chef being a bit too much of a caricature. Here's hoping the coming third season continues its excellent beginning.",2015
8,"OK so it's not what you want you children to model themselves after but then neither was producer Chuck Lorre's Two and a Half Men. This is sort of the female version of that great show and maybe it's because it's a mostly female cast that it seems to raise the ire of so many. I don't know or care, to me its funny. Anna Faris is well Anna Faris and if you like her in things like the ""Scary Movie"" series then you will probably like her playing Christy who often innocently deadpans her way through raunchy or absurd situations with great comedic sensibility. Allison Janney plays Christy's Mom Bonnie who is the counterpart to Charley Harper's slutty mom Evelyn. The show probably could use a ""Berta"" but it has enough good characters to develop into the same sort of comedic juggernaut Two and a Half Men was, given some good writing. Time will tell.",2013
7,"""Mom"" is a refreshing, in-your-face comedy with so many laughs you don't get much chance to settle down. For many people it will be too crude, but for those who don't mind the raunchier side of TV, this one is just fine (and never as crude as ""Two and a Half Man"" has become). Multiple Emmy winner (""West Wing"") Alison Janney plays the mom to cute as a button Anna Faris (""Scary Movie"") who in turn is the mom to relative newcomer Sadie Calvano. They all share problems with addiction and sexual appetites which make for lots of jokes as well as some touching emotional moments. ",2013

9,"Mom depicts with humor a real-life single mother trying to survive in this 21st century social climate. The characters are believable and the situations are real. I found myself laughing out loud any number of times during the show. Anna Faris does a fine job of depicting Christy,a single-mom recovering from an addiction problem with two kids from different guys. Christy's mom Bonnie (Alison Janney) does and excellent job of portraying the typical 2013 cougar who lives for her own self-gratification and seem perfectly fine with having been a terrible mother. I hope with all sincerity that Mom gets picked-up by the network. Good luck Mom!",2013
10,I do not really understand how people do not appreciate this show. They are completely missing out on the plot. It talks about real life problems with some humour. It does not advocates any kind of lifestyle but just how people deal with those problems. There are not a lot of shows that talk about those topics and it is done really well. ,2013
9,"Oh my god this show has me laughing in so many ways. people talk bad about the first episode. It is like any show and you are just getting to know the characters. The content is a serious matter and is brought to light in a most hilarious way. After that it takes off like fire. Fantastic writing, clever funny lines and a great connection. I love the characters. I hardly ever laugh out loud while watching TV. I have had plenty of truly great laughs. People shouldn't be judging a show because they don't the matter of talking about teenage pregnancy, or alcoholism. Its great to see these topics discussed in a open way. A funny one. But at the same time these topics are taken seriously.",2014
1,"Several of my friends recommended this show to me after the first season, so I decided to check it out. One episode was more than enough. I am a reasonably responsible adult who goes to work every day, and am a landlord on the side. So I find absolutely nothing funny in a show about an irresponsible single mom and her equally irresponsible mother who gamble away three months of rent, skip out on the landlord, then try and make the audience sympathetic to their ""plight"". Revolting.",2014
1,"Really? You really had a sappy, totally unrealistic stupid show glorifying teenage pregnancy, with the Mom and grandmother happily supporting this moronic situation? Don't you understand how much damage you did, and that now some stupid, immature teenage girls who already are playing with this fantasy with their equally stupid boyfriends just got another green light to delude themselves into believing, ""Aww, how cute I'll be pregnant and my boyfriend will be all happy and supportive, as will my mom, and we'll just trip on down the road of life and live happily ever after..""blah blah blah! I kept waiting and hoping that the pregnancy test would be negative and that the girl would get a wake up call to at least use birth control. But no...not a word about that. What a terrible disservice you did to teenage girls! The only HONEST show about teen pregnancy is ""Teen Mom"", which shows the reality of boyfriends who bail, girls who have to give up everything for that baby they had so much fun making, the mothers of the teen moms who are usually single as well having to step in and give up their own lives because of the selfish decisions their daughters made, the poverty and struggles, abuse by the boyfriends, constant stress, depression and misery, lack of education so bettering themselves is next to impossible....That's the reality! Not this moronic garbage in this particular Mom episode! Honestly, shame on you for such a stupid, thoughtless episode!",2013
2,"We really wanted to like this. Well-known and well-like actors, good reviews, etc. Started cringing from the first scene. Topics were simply too serious to be funny. Multi-generational sluts, teen pregnancies, adultery, drug and alcohol use, drug sales, (at least they threw in AA), absent and deadbeat dads..... Hey I can watch the news for this plot. About half way through we voted to delete the scheduled recordings. I'm trying to think back to see if I actually laughed during the show. No, I don't remember doing so. We did keep pointing out the various actors and what shows we knew them from. So sad that there is so much comic talent here going to waste.",2013
9,"Once in while, it is good to be reminded that we live in a male centric society. The drinking and womanizing of Charlie Harper was quite acceptable and cute. But try to make a comedy about the realities of life for the women who have been dumped by the Charlie Harpers of this world and you get comments about the values this sitcom is carrying. Isn't that a little hypocritical at best, and plainly sexist at worst? I simply love Anna Faris (I hope she reads this) This lady is talented and able to carry this show with the fabulous Allison Janey. ""Mom"" is certainly not perfect, but it has the unique quality of portraying something true. It is honest and doesn't try to be anything else. It is refreshing, and in my opinion, deserve an 8.",2013
1,"The main actress is a great female comedian. In all her works so far, she never needed a laughter track to make us laugh. But for this show, she needed it.",2014
9,"I've loved Anna Faris since the first time i saw her in the Scary Movie franchise. She's one of the most hilarious actress, she makes those faces you cannot not laugh at. I've discovered Allison Janney in Juno and thought she was just amazing! And the chemistry of them together is really great! The jokes are well placed through the episodes, they deal with important subject and are able to treat them with comedy and tact and that is a great quality. The grand-mother/mother/daughter relationship is fantastic! The kid actors and also pretty funny. ",2013

1,"I don't get what's supposed to be funny about three generations of women making poor life choices. Promiscuity, teenage pregnancy, alcoholism, drug addiction, drug dealing, deadbeat parents, all-around awful behaviour are hardly comedy material and surely aren't laughing matter if taken as lightly and superficially as the show does.",2014
9,"I was intrigued by the idea of a comedy show that portrays the horrors of addiction and its inevitable tragedies. As a long term survivor of the disease of alcoholism and an active participant in recovery, I began watching it to see how the show presented itself as relates to recovery. I have to say, after having watched all of the episodes so far that I find both the unfolding stories of the characters and the little slices of life at AA to be very well done. For those who say that the show is exploitative of human tragedy, I invite you to work hard, become a drug addict or alcoholic and come to a recovery program to see just how close to reality this show really is. In my time in recovery I have seen countless situations that were just as ridiculous and tragic as this one turn around and become stories of human triumph over adversity. One of the great joys of recovery is to be able to look back at the crazy things that happened in our lives and laugh because they are long gone and have been replaced by sanity. In my experience, early sobriety is often just as crazy as is presented here. I have never had anyone pull up to my house drunk in a fire truck as happened in the latest episode, but I have to say, if it did occur, I wouldn't be very surprised. Drunks are an imaginative lot and prone to bad decisions. People under the influence, both of substances and of substance abusers can do some very stupid things If you can't relate to the humor in this show, I understand. I probably couldn't either if I hadn't seen it played out over and over for years. Far too often, it ends tragically, but the joy that comes when it ends in triumph is wonderfully fulfilling. I have been so fortunate to have seen a good number of people come through things at least as crazy as this show and lead great lives, and then be able to look back and laugh at the folly that was their life under the yoke of addiction. I can't wait to see what happens to Christy and her mom! 9 Stars.",2014
2,"No, no, no. I laughed once & only because I share the main character's name & she pronounced it funny. So many actors that I enjoy, it's a shame that their talents are wasted on this drivel. The comedy is forced. This show is trying to sell comedy on situations that aren't comedic. This is a show about at least 2 generations of alcoholic, drug addicted, promiscuous mothers with zero parenting skills & the possible breeding of a third generation to turn out the same way. I found myself frustrated & irritated while watching this show. She comes from work to find a boy sneaking out of her daughter's window, then learns from her young son that her daughter & that boy took a shower together. Her response was a sarcastic ""awesome"" & then proceeds to do NOTHING about it. From then on it was nothing but downhill. Absolutely appalling. I just don't think I see this lasting. At least it's not lasting for me cause I'm not watching anything more from this show.",2013
9,I had to review this show after seeing the current reviews posted. At the moment there are 4 written reviews and all but one are HIGHLY critical and undeserved in my opinion.,2013
9,"I watched the first episode of Ray Donovan without knowing much about the plot or characters. Liev Schrieber is fantastic in the lead role and is reminiscent of Tony Soprano in that he is a dark, violent lead male under constant stress who is protective and nurturing of those he loves, while at the same time projecting an aura of violence and danger to those who would cross him. One scene, where Ray menaces a man who double-crosses him is particularly chilling. The supporting characters are also very solid. Paula Malcomson, (Ray's wife Abby) under-utilized in Deadwood is here allowed to flex her acting muscles in several scenes with Schreiber. Also in the show is the great Jon Voigt, who plays Ray's father. The conflict between them is set up right away in this first episode and one senses an Oedipal confrontation coming somewhere down the line. Most series start out weak and get better as the show grows and develops. This show, however, started out with a bang. If it gets BETTER it will very soon be the best show on television.",2013
10,"In watching Ray Donovan, the characters have such a believable existence that you can't help but wonder about the things the rich and famous we read about daily really do. I will not be able to read about a scandal without wondering if a ""cleaner"" was involved. This show is a true testament to those creators and writers who have brought about something so new and fresh that all other current series seem to pale in comparison. At times, the laugh out loud tastelessness of things being said just leaves me wanting more. Even if feeling slightly guilty for laughing. I am hoping this show stays raw and powerful and witty and that we will get many more seasons of the same.",2013
10,I heard about this show from friends who were discussing new shows. They were raving about it and how good it is. Also going on about Liev Schreiber and how good he is in it. Decided to check it out myself and I was not disappointed. Good solid story lines. Great cast. Its about time that a show of this quality is shown. Just hope whoever does the marketing this show does a better job as I have never even seen a commercial or ad for this show. I hope it doesn't get cancelled because no one knows of its existence. So many good shows get cancelled that way and then we get stuck with another trashy reality TV show. I also like that there isn't just one story line. There are many story lines going on. Jon Voight is also a great actor and I was happy to see him in a good TV show.,2013
10,Greetings from Lithuania.,2013
9,"Incredibly unique show, the writing is phenomenal and the acting is a great compliment to it...The show has a style and vibe that I really can't compare to anything and it's dark humor is top notch...Almost every scene is entertaining because the characters are so great and I really enjoy how portions of the background story are unveiled week by week...If there's one negative I can imagine someone saying about the show is that it's a bit of a slow starter...I don't even think this show has hit third gear yet and I'm already hooked...Just hope they don't smother all the greatness out of it like they did to Dexter..but that's another review",2013
10,I'm not sure how so many people could write a review after 1 episode of this drama. i must admit it was a very good episode but judging it after one episode is like looking at a race horse before you've seen it run.,2013
10,"I think Liev Schreiber is great as it is, but he plays an interesting role in Ray Donovan, and backed by an equally interesting cast. It took me until the second episode for the show to really catch me; when it did, it did big time. We often get a little glimpse of father/son relationships in certain shows, but Ray Donovan gets real gritty with that area. In fact, the whole family aspect gets a very unique spin here compared to others.",2013
10,"The previews and billboards of this Showtime series did nothing to intrigue or attract me as a viewer. I watched the pilot merely because there was nothing else to watch and I was slightly curious, and because I really like Liev as an actor, and Jon Voight is always great. I got hooked because of the underlying forces at work that shape the personalities of Ray and his brothers. It was a total shocker and gripping, believable surprise. ",2015

1,"Ugh, this used to be a good show. The spouse loves it so we watch. But I realized tonight that there is not one redeemable character. They are all annoying and awful. I wouldn't have a drink with one of them. There's not one happy moment of lightness. The world is bad, can we have a tiny tiny bit of joy in ANY of these people's lives? And all the flashbacks show how happy & wonderful Ray and Abby were together but all I remember is them screaming at each other and lying to each other for four seasons. And her, can she speak a sentence without the F word? And shave!!! Shave your face Ray!!! That look is ugly and played.",2017
8,"I think the one thing a lot of people who don't like this show seemed to have a problem with was ""lack of believability"" and ""pointless sex / violence / bad deeds"" . But I think that's exactly what the show is about, the fact that dark and awful things happen all the time, dirty meaningless sex happens all the time, and horrible violence happens all the time. And I personally find it interesting and compelling, but maybe my ""moral compass"" is broken. ",2013
8,"OK so I am not a TV person, I much prefer a good book or a radio show, American (trash) TV is not my thing. My wife recorded this and suggested I might like it - well she's bang on. The plot is tantalizing, the acting is first class (british soaps look out) and the direction brilliant - each episode like a mini film. I like the almost caricature characters - are there really people like this in LA - I fear yes! The sub plot with the boxing gym is a little off, but I guess this will develop as time passes. In short, I am looking forward to the next episode and it's a long, long time since a TV drama caught my interest.",2013

He then goes to his other client who wants him to stalk his girlfriend. While he watches her, there is a man outside her house watching her. Ray gets his license plate number, and goes to her door, and tells her what has happened. It turns out that that they know each other. She has a drink, and then they begin to kiss. It turns out that she has Epilepsy, and she has a small time seizure. Later on Ray is in the stalkers room, and threatens him not to go near her again, and if he did he would die. Ray goes to his brother and his brother tells him that his father is coming, and he has a half brother. After that they go to his clients party, where his client feels betrayed and tells his wife that he ****** the girl. His wife gets mad. He then brakes the old clients finger.

Everything that could possibly go wrong does. I mean really? Abby is diagnosed with cancer. Bunchy's wife gets postpartum depression. Conor shoots a neighbor's inflatable toy. Mickey just tries to do everything possible to cause trouble. And then there is Ray. He kills a high ranking Russian mafia guy? Really? And where does Ray get the money to pay his employees? Apparently he had to give all his money to the boss woman. And lastly, there is Hector the fighter. Seriously, he can't stop sleeping with his sister and kick her to the curb? ",2017
8,"I have not seen any advertisements of this series like other reviewers, but after watching the pilot episode I have to say this is the best new original series i have watched this year besides Hannibal. It takes a lot of familiar plot elements from its cable TV predecessors, and adds more to it. It's not as dark and monotonous like Homeland, but still brings the necessary suspense to it that makes this highly original series more of a dark comedy than a serial drama Jon Voight and Liev Schriber are excellent as the main roles in this series. I hope the writers can build on this interesting premise, and make it a hit TV series that it deserves to be. 8 out of 10",2013
3,"There is a lot to like about Ray Donovan. The acting is good; the production values are excellent; it's a well-shot show; and the writing is also pretty good. There is one major problem, however.

4,"I wanted to like this show, but season after season, nothing has changed. I keep reading in the reviews about great character development, but to me the characters haven't changed and more importantly I can care less about any one of them. Every time it seems like maybe someone has an opportunity to turn a corner and move forward with their life, they just revert back to the same stereotypical character that they have been portraying throughout the series. For those who feel differently, enjoy, but for me, I'm done.",2017

What makes this series fascinating is that it is based on a true story which makes me respect the real characters even more.",2013

7,"Masters of Sex was one of rare TV shows that had a refreshing approach towards human sexuality. I can even argue that it was somewhat educational even if we assume that it merely pushed people to read the books of Masters & Johnson. It did more than that but gradually the refreshing approach was bogged down by so many irrelevant, uninteresting, outright abysmal side characters and their awful story arcs.",2017

10,"What a relief! A breath of fresh air, such a welcome televisual event after the utter toot that generally circulates at the moment. The five episodes skittered by, delivering substance, great acting, and characters who tugged at the brain chords. Meaning that you think about the program long after the credits. I missed the 'live' screenings and so opted for 4OD, and watched all episodes back to back. The final scene of episode five when Dr Masters finally gives way to emotion and cracks whilst holding Ginnie's hand... well, I'd swap you that for all five million trashy episodes of X Factor that's for sure!

As far as I can see, the acting is great, the writing is great, the characters are great, and the time period is very realistically portrayed. This is the 1950's. It is a very conservative America. Not as much in the political sense as in the cultural sense. This was before all hell broke loose in 1964-65. The Civil Rights Movement was taking place and gaining ground in the South, but this is white upper class America we are seeing. A white hospital with white doctors and white secretaries. Because that is the way it was then.",2014
9,"The title ""Masters of Sex"" works on many levels and the creators of the show are well aware of the attention that this title will draw. This show is about the first scientific research in the area of sex based on the Masters and Johnson studies, who are the protagonists of the story set to the backdrop of the late 1950's at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. The set design is just about right and it very accurately represents the theme and ideology of the time. The characters are sketched out perfectly and there is no dearth of good acting performances with Michael Sheen stealing the show for his portrayal of the incredibly complex William Masters. The main part of the show is of course the study of human sexual response which implies a lot of mature content. These scenes, however tastefully done, may be a little too strong for the average viewer but if one can get over the explicit content, one can see their relevance to the plot. The story still seems a little empty at certain times but can be expected to fill up as it progresses with the introduction of new characters. All in all, a very well presented and unique show.",2013
6,"Everything interesting was shown and said in the first season, which was quite innovative, rich and well-paced. The gist of the series was the ground-breaking research of Masters and Johnson, how both characters met, started their collaboration, and the vast array of difficulties which frayed their work in an evoking and well-recreated American social setting.",2015

For example, in the first episode when Lizzy Caplan just wants to have casual sex with the young resident and no long-term relationship. The young resident gets attached and wants more than just casual sex. This may be the case for 1/10000 women...especially during that time...but it is too unrealistic for the viewed to swallow. Also, they don't do a good job selling the sex study and the premise of the show as a serious important topic of research. The producers cant convince the viewer that there is an important scientific aspect behind the plot...it simply people just having sex and Showtime trying to get viewers. Unconvincing effort.",2013

You have all these glamorous- looking women in stylish retro attire trying to advance society or something, working against a supposed era of sexual oppression that is so popular to romanticize these days like in ""Mad Men"" and ""The Help"".

The whole thing from that point on began to seem pointless. His marriage in reality was, in fact, different from what was portrayed in the series. They had children . . . so what was the point? As fiction, this seemed simply silly meandering. I stopped after fast-forwarding through much of the second half of the season (1). Michael Sheen did too good a job of being a horridly little hypocrite and Lizzy Caplan too good a job of being a capable, smart woman for the coming together of the two to be anything but disgusting.

3,"this is one of the most boring TV shows I've suffered through. Dr. Masters comes off as a freak, and Johnson has this weird way of speaking that is school teacher-ish. This has absolutely no basis in reality or historic context. Im sure the attraction is the nudity and sex, which is bizarre to say the least. why do we watch then?, because its so bad we laugh at it, speed it up and try to do an episode in 15 minutes. Again, the actor playing Masters looks like Mickey Mouse on a bad acid trip. How does something like this carry on when great TV like Low Winter Sun is cancelled? Cant imagine how Dr. Masters would've reacted to seeing his life's work made into a boring sex drama for TV, what an insult.",2014

There are no eye candy sets here, the men are all either unredeemable dicks or hugely patronizing pains and the women are, by far, the most appealing characters and actors. But that said, the writers certainly seem to have taken an interesting series and run it into the ditch by season 3. The characters have pretty much all outlived their viewer interest.

It's also based on a successful series of novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, so it's everyone's bet just how this first installment would perform that would determine its future as a potential film franchise, where many other potentials have fallen after its initial start - The Dark is Rising, The Golden Compass, and I am Number Four, to name but a few in this genre.",2013

The movie was basically a Twilight-ified version of the books I loved.

I understand that the director and the screenwriter were allowed to take some liberties with the script, and some parts of the book were just impossible to adapt into a movie, but this 'interpretation' was awful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even someone I deeply disliked. I was close to getting up and leaving the theater.",2013

7,"When asked if I wanted to see this film I half-heartedly said yes with little understanding of what I was going to see, wondering if I will regret it and have teen girls crying around me (I'm a guy), I was expecting an over romantic chick flick with something to do with magic, love, forbidden love and sacrifice. Something along the lines of 'Twilight' this assumption was Incorrect. And I was pleasantly surprised and pleased this wasn't another case of sparkling vampires or something similar. For all those who haven't seen this movie and believe it's the same thing as Twilight this alone being the reason you're not going to see it, you'd be wrong like I was at the start I recommend getting a bunch of friends and seeing it on a weekend . Where Twilight was just a pure romantic love story for fanged freaks, 'Beautiful Creatures' is a contemporary version of 'Romeo and Juliet' that explores the ""humanity"" of an unknown supernatural world of powers, preferably known as 'Casters' that's what they call themselves.",2013

6,"In Gatlin, South Caroline, the teenager Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) dreams on leaving the conservative town and go to the college. Ethan has dreams with a mysterious girl and when he meets the fifteen year-old newcomer Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) in his class, he realizes that she is the girl of his dreams. The outcast Lena is rejected by the mates since she is the granddaughter of Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons), who is considered a worshiper of the devil by the superstitious dwellers. ",2013
1,So this movie is set in Gatlin...and the main characters are Ethan and Lena... and that is where the similarities to the book end. My friend and I recently read the book in preparation for going to the movie. We adored the book and were excited to see the film. ,2013
7,"My brother and I went to see this in theaters by using our birthday gift our grandmother had given us with much expectations. Later, we walked out of the theater and we had a good time. Even though the professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it mixed feelings, I thought this is a pretty good film. It's not spectacular, though for there are some problems that I do have with the film.",2013
8,"so this weekend I went out of my way to catch a movie that interested me a lot from the trailers and the concept. Beautiful Creatures I know at first glance it seems like a wanna be twilight but I actually found it a lot better. I had to drive to another city to a theater I've never been to and see it all by myself in an empty theater and I didn't care. It was that good lol .Both Twilight and Beautiful Creatures are in the same genre of ""Young Adult"" stories but both couldn't be more different. From a film level, this tops the twilight films. ",2013
1,****May Contain Spoilers**** This was completely awful. If I were Kami Garcia I would be embarrassed. There were actually only 2 things in this movie that followed the books and I can't even remember what the second one is that is how disturbed I am. Within the first 2 minutes they had already screwed it up. The dreams that Ethan has pertaining to Lena. Where is the rest of the cast?? I can understand them not having a big budget (I don't know whether they did or didn't I am just assuming they didn't because of lack of characters) but really? They can't get even the lollipop that Ridley uses correct? Lena and Ethan don't Celt at all in the movie. Ethan never dies. Why the heck did Genevieve kill her Ethan? And not even have the Book of Moons. Where is the Sharpie? Why wasn't Lena driving a hearse? This really just makes my head hurt. I am so disturbed by how much they butchered what could have been an amazing movie. I really don't expect them to be able to even make a sequel now that Ethan didn't even die. I won't be watching it either if they do. This is an atrocity.,2013
1,"I thought this was going to be a fun and slightly scary paranormal/monster/romance, sort of like the Twilight series. Instead, I paid for the privilege of getting bludgeoned with Cultural Marxist/Politically Correct orthodoxies and bigoted anti-Christian stereotypes. A few examples: 1.) Christians are loathsome, vile stereotypes, but sorcerers/witches (""casters"" in this movie) are fine folk. Christians ban books and loudly and obnoxiously pray to be delivered from ""heathens,"" rather than reaching out to non-Christians with love and compassion. No scenes of Christians praying silently over a sick child in the ICU, or donating time and money to Christian charities which have made the world a vastly better place. 2.) Small town folk are ignorant, backward, close-minded dead-enders, but New York City is heaven on earth. No mention of the possibility that small-town people might be eager refugees from the toxic taxes, crowding, murder, rape, theft, and moral relativism of the modern American metropolis. Finally, there is the fatal plot flaw (spoiler alert) of the ""casters"" is this film being immortal, yet one of them gets shot and dies at the end. I don't get it. Don't waste your time or money on this wretched mess.",2013
10,"First off, how many times do people get let down going in to movies expecting them to be like the movies??? Get over it! The movie was great...the main characters were great actors and had great chemistry. I personally loved the movie. I actually liked it more than i thought, which is a good surprise for me. I knew id like it, but i liked it so much more! I really hope they continue to make movies from this series whether or not they follow the books. A good movie is a good movie...so all u disturbed book series followers get ur panties out a wad nd learn to appreciate great young actors and their hard work to make entertaining movies. For those looking for a good fantasy movie with love, action, and funny moments, this is the movie for you. It was good beginning to end.",2013
8,"The trend for magic and fantasy based romantic chronicles, something older than time itself, has recently gotten a 21st century reboot with Harry Potter and Twilight, and a tidal wave of ""teen fiction"" has emerged, each winning its own followers in the same way bands or sports teams do. Hollywood, scenting a sure buck, has begun adapting these, with differing rates of success. The template for them all is of course the runaway success of the ""Twilight"" films, which stuck close to their literary sources and used a cast of pretty and pretty vacant leads, leading to the films deserved reputation for boredom and cringe worthy sappiness (as well as slow meandering plots that went nowhere very slowly) Now that Meyer's cycle has played itself out, we're all waiting for ""the new Twilight"" in the same way people of a previous generation looked for ""the new Star Wars"" Could it be ""Beautiful Creatures""?",2013
7,"After seeing this film last night it is clear that they did not want to make it like the book, and if they did they did an awful job in doing so. There were so many characters missing along with so many enchanting moments that made the book. With that being said the film itself was outstanding. Great performances by all actors and just all around a job well done. Had I not read the books I would have walked out giving it a 9/10. For me I am going to take the book series and the movie series as two separate stories that are so close to being the same in that they have the same story line. If others can do the same and try to just see them as separate things than this could be a really successful movie series.",2013
1,"This is one of the absolute WORST movies I have ever seen. I haven't read the books, so this is not based on how good or poor the adaptation is...just how purely awful the movie is. All three of the ""senior"" actors are great actors. The fact that not one of them was able to pull off even one well-acted, honest scene should tell you something. The younger actors are unknown to me, and I now have no desire to know them. There are actually good (funny/satirical) B movies out there. This isn't one of them. It is a BAD B movie. I took a young teen who wanted to go and she was bored but stuck with it because of the books. I honestly felt tortured having to sit through this show. The saddest thing is that I wanted to read the books prior to this and now I think the well is poisoned. I can't imagine anyone liking this movie. Our audience grumbled and complained during the show and afterwards.",2013
3,"My 19 year old daughter and I both have read the entire series and absolutely loved the books, so we were very excited to see the movie. Both of us walked out of the theater feeling let down. The main complaint we had was how far the movie strayed from the book. It wasn't only a couple of things as another reviewer said, but some pretty major elements and characters in the plot. I understand about time constraints but I feel like the screenwriter could have written the story in a better way and remained true to the original story. For example, making Amma the ""Keeper "" (rather than Marian Ashcroft) and Ethan 's caretaker just felt wrong. The ""Moons "" song was never mentioned at all and I thought that was a big element lost. Genevieve killed her Ethan in the movie and she did not use the ""Book of Moons "" to bring him back. If there's ever a sequel, will she suddenly turn nice to help them? At the end, Ethan wasn't stabbed by Saraphine and brought back by BoM to the demise of Macon. So in a sequel, how will they handle Ethan 's split soul? Then Lena was claimed light and dark and got her green and gold eyes even though that didn't actually happen until the 2nd book. In the first one, she wasn't claimed remember? All these plot changes lead me to believe that there will not be a sequel. ",2013

1,"Movie 43 is a collection of twelve short films starring twenty-five big name celebrities and not containing even a fraction of the laughs in its ninety-seven minute runtime. Connected in a disjointed manner and baiting the audience by a filled cast, this is one of the most unpleasant times at the movies one could have. Not since Garry Marshall's Valentine's Day have we seen so many shining actors succumb to such joylessly impotent material. Only this time, the material is not only impotent, but crass and well over the line of reprehensibility to the point where one shakes their head and assures their inner-self to walk out of the theater, walk to the nearest video store and rent as many foreign films as they can carry.",2013
8,"I don't know, maybe I just have a strange sense of humor, but I thought this movie was funny. I always find it funny when serious actors do slapstick roles. I watched it several times and I still find it funny. I say if you like movies like Airplane or Blazing Saddles, just a hell of a lot nastier and rude, then this is the movie for you.",2017
1,"I have to be honest- I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations to begin with. It is only on a rare occasion anymore that I actually buy a ticket for a movie with any hope that it might actually provide entertainment, which is a shame. This movie, however, just lowered the bar- by a LOT. Hands down one of the worst movies that I've ever seen- and that's saying something. It is just a gaggle of actors working on an acid-trip of a script. Every bit of comedy is based on shock value, which wears thin on your patience very early on. It's gross, lewd, and utterly lacking of any wit or connection with the audience. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone- as I nearly went up to the box office and demanded a refund. It isn't even that I'm a prude or hate gross-out humor, I'm 18 for crying out loud- I just have the ability to recognize when someone put actual effort and thought into making a movie funny and when Hollywood is laughing AT US, instead of vice versa. Miss this one. 1/10",2013
1,"After a misleading Trailer I gave this ""Comedy"" a chance. To be honest this is the worst movie I have ever seen. You can only laugh about the ""jokes"" if you still have the humor of a 14 year old who is just reaching puberty. Seriously. Every joke is based on penis, pussy, flat sex and even shitting on your partner. Even the allusions towards other movies are so horribly done that there is no way to compare this level with a Tarantino style.",2013

1,"I want to let each and everyone reading this review know that I created this IMDb account for the sole purpose of writing a review for this very movie, Movie43. First, I would like to start by mentioning how the movie trailer is very misleading and provides people with false hope and expectations. From public defecation, to having one's testicles on one's neck, and even incestuous relationships are only a few of the many examples of the dark and rather disgusting sense of humor that along with the imagery of the movie create a rather repellent and false portrayal of sex and other universal themes. Additionally, Movie 43 consists of several unrelated scenes that do nothing in terms of both the plot and characters' development of the movie. This movie is so bad that it has the ability to infect one's nerve cells with both aids and cancer, creating a new type of nerve cells that reproduce at an exponential rate and possess the ability of causing one's IQ level to drop dramatically. If you don't want to waste your precious time and intelligence, then listen to what I and many others have to say about this movie and simply don't waste your time watching it. Every user that claims that this movie is nothing else but absolute rubbish is telling nothing else but the honest truth. There is this saying that seems very appropriate given the main message that I am trying to convey; ""Curiosity killed the cat"". This saying serves as a warning declaiming to not let your curiosity get the best of you! A great number of people, myself included have fallen prey into this very trap and have made the very mistake of disregarding many of the wise reviews proclaiming that this movies is complete balderdash as it lacks plot development and many more elements crucial to a movie's reputation and watch-ability. Just like Plato, a well known Greek Philosopher said: ""A wise person learns from his mistakes! A wiser one learns from others' mistakes!"" I hope this review came in handy and opened your eyes to the harsh reality that is Movie 43. I wish each and every one of you the best of luck!!! Trust me, you will need it!!! XD",2017
1,"Wow, just wow. I'm astonished. I've seen over a thousand movies in my life, and out of all of them, this is the worst. Its worse than The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, After Last Season, and Ren Seeks Help. This is the worst, most pointless, hollow, and lazy excuse for a theatrical feature I've ever seen. There is no vision or creativity here, its literally just a bunch of unrelated 5-minute skits. I could at least give this movie some credit if the skits were funny at all, but they're not. They're all disgusting and repulsive. As I sat through the first skit, I was like ""well that sucked, maybe the next one will be better"". After the next four, I was like ""well maybe one of them will make me laugh"". I was wrong. The rest was just a vapid, soulless, agonizing experience. I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even involuntarily smile during this whole movie. The whole product just feels cynically slapped together with no respect for its audience and for the sole purpose of making money. Many of the celebrities they got were either bribed or guilt tripped into being in their skits. This isn't even a real movie; its like a bunch of unfunny YouTube videos mashed together. Think of the 15 worst Smosh videos you've seen, and watch them back to back. That's basically this movie but with more depraved sexually graphic content and random celebrities. You'd have a lot more fun watching YouTube videos for 90 minutes than watching Movie 43. Normally I have no problem with gross and inappropriate content, but only if there's a point. This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Slimy film business practices typically only happen occasionally behind the scenes of most mainstream films. Every decision involved in the making of this movie started with the thought ""We could exploit the Hollywood system by..."". Movies like this are the reason IMDb should allow a 0- star rating. This movie is nothing. This movie deserves nothing. Therefore, I shall give it nothing.",2017

You either love this movie or hate it, judging by  the votes and comments, but I loved it, and many others will too - so  give it a chance and watch, don't just read the bad reviews. I probably  wouldn't have bothered to watch either if I'd read the reviews on here  first, but I'm so glad I did!  The movie content blurs the boundaries between the surreal and reality  and takes the P out of society and ourselves. 'You couldn't make that  up' scenes that really happen - unbelievably! The hair-gel scene in  There's Something About Mary and the toilet scene in Dumb and Dumber -  these are the kinds of sequences that make up movie 43. Yes, they're  disgusting, but they do happen, and you have to laugh about the  ridiculousness of it all!",2013

I can only assume this movie was made for people who enjoy poo, balls, and cats jerking off to pictures of their owners. now it may seem funny at first but believe me when i say this movie sucked. Now with that said i laughed harder walking out making fun of the movie then i did for the entire one hour and thirty minutes of painfully awkward moments. other then that though it did had a really good cast, even though it seemed like this might of been a movie for them to just let off some steam and not be so serious.

And by the way, the synopsis on this site isn't even close to being correct. The plot is a guy (Dennis Quaid) who is trying to pitch his many ridiculous movie ideas to a studio exec (Greg Kinnear). As Quaid is apparently describing them to Kinnear, a clip of the movie is shown to the audience. The ideas are completely absurd, uninspired and not at all funny in any way. It's a shame that all these top-name actors are so desperate for money to make such a film. Bigger shame is they won't get a dime!

He asks them to step off, politely, but they simply respond that, ""That's no way to talk to men of God!"", and throw him out of their monastery. For weeks this goes on, the monks selling flowers, and the florist getting more and more desperate to make them stop. Finally, he goes to Hugh Mactaggart, the biggest, baddest man in town -- he could get anyone to leave town -- so Patty decides he's the best way to get rid of the monks, gives him the rest of the money, and retires to bed, wary of the results. In the morning, a knock on his door reveals Mactaggart, offering a firm handshake and saying, ""They shan't be botherin' ya again Patty.""

I can usually find some redeeming quality in most movies no matter how bad they are, but this is just a pile of crap. I almost asked for my money back. There wasn't one good thing about this. How on Earth did this movie get made. I'm shocked at how bad it was. How did someone hold a gun to the heads of all these talented actors to get this movie made. I can't say enough bad things about this. Wow! It even mentioned ""Howard the Duck"" as a bad movie. So, they know about bad movies. This will probably take the place of ""Howard the Duck"" as the worst movie of all time.",2013

How people can lie so much in the description of the movie. I can't believe those actors took part in it. What a shame. Why? Why! This is only for people who laughs at obscenities and profanity.

However, no review could prepare me for what I was about to see. Movie 43 is a culmination of 'comedy' skits directed by a multitude of talented people - talented people that decided to bang their heads against a wall and create a script after they had acquired a multitude of seizures and other types of brain damage. Movie 43 is weak, no new jokes are present here. The type of humor that exists in Movie 43 is the type of humor your troubled 13-year-old son would find in the dark side of Youtube. This movie isn't a comedy, it's a horror-drama. You're sad that you're watching it, and horrified when it ends.

This film is literally everything wrong with the film making industry and I can't bare the fact that this film somehow got the attention of the cast in this film. It's amazing how unfunny this film is. Literally any skit on YouTube is better and more worth your time. This film tries to be funny by being offensive and gross, which really doesn't do anything besides make the viewers go ""Ew, god. Why?"". Did I mention that this film literally has no story? This film is literally just weird and unfunny skits that are inferior to the skits you'd find on YouTube. You'd think for a film with literally no story, there'd be at least something good about it otherwise. But I can think of nothing. I'm honestly debating on whether or not this is the worst film I've ever seen. The reason for that is because I'm not even sure if this is even a movie. It's just a compilation of really dumb and weird skits that, again, YouTubers can do better, and for a big Hollywood ""film"" like this, that's embarrassing. If this is the future of comedy sketches in films, we have officially reached the bottom of the barrel, and I think we're done here. I recommend to just watch comedy sketches on YouTube instead, as literally nothing about this film is worth anyone's time whatsoever. It is really weird and unfunny. And I'm okay with some weirdness here and there that is at least well executed. But again, this film is gross and offensive, and for some reason, I'm supposed to find that funny? I hope Hollywood has learned their lesson because I couldn't bare another one of these so called ""films"" again.",2017

I don't really think its a 10, but I'm giving it that just to stick it to you humorless snobs. Perhaps you won't find this movie suitable to your ""evolved"" pallets, but for those of us that still laugh at farts, and make dick jokes and think seeing someone getting punched in the balls is funny, then you should be amused by this one.

However, the movie does not disappoint, its very entertaining and full of action and hard core scenes. The acting is as expected, nothing Oscar worthy but good enough from action legends like them. The idea is simple and is easily understood. The one difference in this movie is that the chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Stallone is excellent and they deliver some humor also. The only downside that I can think about is the fact that this movie is really meant for both the stars fans and not people who are looking for real ideas or excellent cinematography. Bottom line go enjoy the movie and don't forget your popcorn.",2013

This movie is with both main actor, not a Sly movie with a cameo of Arnold, its both of them all the time. It's good and funny. The plot is intelligent, I liked it. It's not a remake of any kind, of course you know the end or you can predict some of the turnouts. But, overall it is fun and intelligent. The ending is rushed a bit, turns out like a bit of a sort of ""Expendable"" style of movie, but not as much. No sex, or any kind of romance in that movie, or super chicks making you want to jump at the screen, it's a typical American movie, blood, guns & some violence, but no chick.",2013

Actually, you get a fairly decent film.",2014

10,"Let me start by saying that the fact alone Schwarzenegger and Stallone are in their 60's doing a film like this is the ultimate reason to watch this. I can never understand why people claim they are too old. If anything they put people half their age to shame with their physical abilities and they should inspire people to want to stay energetic well into their senior years. This movie is absolute Gold! We finally have the two biggest movie stars of all time headlining a movie together and believe me you get what you pay for! The action and visuals were what I expected, very clear and stunning. The prison was almost a character itself in making the audience feel apart of the setting. My hat goes off to the director who was able to balance the off-screen chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger and fuse it into the story. No joke these two guys were made to star in a movie together. The nostalgia is off the roof!! Every movie has its flaws and no doubt this one did but in saying that, I was able to automatically ignore them here because of the story, it was well paced. We see Stallone's character introduced as a prison security expert who is set up and put into the worlds most secure prison. Here he teams up with none other than Schwarzenegger who plays another prisoner, pretty much ""the one you don't mess with"". Together they plot their escape and it is done superbly! Overall I think this movie is a well made action thriller and will surprise audiences with something they haven't seen before from both Arnold and Sly. I will be surprised if this film doesn't get much attention at the box office because this movie goes back to a time when Hollywood was larger than life and gave us memorable characters and memorable action scenes. 10/10",2013

But we digress. Sly plays an expert who professionally escapes prisons to test their security. He gets set-up and end's up in an experimental shadow prison from which he and Shwarzie have to escape. The film reminded me a bit of (and borrows elements from) Fortress and THX-1138. Contrary to The Expendables the film has a descent plot and is well made. The VFX are good and never look fake, so generally speaking a fine production. I expected little so I was positively surprised to see that it could deliver 2 hours of solid entertainment. It was never going to be as good as T2 or Cliffhanger but it's a pity it just flopped at the box office. I hope many people give it a second chance on DVD or BD as it is certainly worth the watch.",2014
10,Came back from 'Escape Plan'and I liked it. Seeing 2 of the 80s action icons Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone together was great. The plot was really unique and something new for a change and the small twist between Arnold and Stallone at the ending was just hilarious for me ,2013

Abigail (Amy Ryan) and Hush (50 Cent) are his team and Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) gets them the job. The CIA comes calling to test a privately-run secret prison for the worst of the worst. When he's taken, his team lose track of him. The prison warden Hobbes (Jim Caviezel) refuses to let him go even though he gives the evacuation code. Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the prisoners who helps Breslin but they're on their own.",2014

2,"Don't really know why everybody is praising this movie like a masterpiece. I saw it and regret that i bought a cinema ticket. The acting and storyline is ridiculous bad. Stalone is imprisoned because... yeah, why? He wrote a book and a prison got built including his opinions for a perfect prison. He doesn't know anything about it and than he got imprisoned there because somebody wanted him disappear? What? Why? Schwarzenegger supports him with his prison break with his worst acting ever and that guy who wrote the conversations for him should feel guilty his whole life long. Yeah and then this Oppium drug dealer. lol yeah, why should some drug dealer pay money to imprison him there? A drive by would be much cheaper... oh wait, of course, they needed a Muslim in this movie for Stalones escape plan. And then, last and least: Neil. A drunken doctor haunted by guilt, who tries to redeem himself with helping with the prison break. I was damn close to leave the cinema, but i got still popcorn left and the tickets are too expensive to waste them... ",2013

But if you neglect that need for nostalgia, then all you are left with is a foul movie.

That is not to say that the current crop of action flicks are works of art,they are not, but they are products of their time. Escape Plan feels as if it is a product of the Eighties, and it is difficult to find the appeal of such a past its sell by date product.",2013
3,"It is not often that you get to see a movie that defies description,,,,but I suppose if you wait long enough, anything is possible. Yes, there is lots of action, and yes the acting is fair, but believe me when I say, there is absolutely no sense whatsoever to the plot. You will spend most of your time asking yourself, how did this come about, how did that come about. There is absolutely no continuity in the story and no explanation for half the stuff that happens. So, if you do not need a plot or for it to make sense, and are happy to sit in front of a screen and watch some action and listen to sound effects, without it making any sense,then this is the movie for you. You can give your brain the night off and put your eyes and ears on overtime. I think Stallone and Arnie, can basically write a script during lunch, and just get someone to make the movie regardless. This is nothing but money for the boys. Oh! yeah,,,I gave it a three for the sheer barefaced audacity of making it.",2014
1,Why can't thugged out gangster rappers just stick to rappin'? When I saw the rapper who goes by the moniker half dollar or 50 pennies was a part of this film I knew there was no way it would be saved. I am so relieved that I did not watch this mess in the theater. Stallone should really retire. It seems that his head keeps getting bigger with age. It looks down right swollen. The skin on his face looks like silicone. I kept wondering if the make-up people on the set couldn't do something more to make him look more human. His acting also seems to be getting worse with age.,2014
2,Do we really need to see another movie in which Stallone plays the victim vs some big bad brutal machine? And in which the warden is a sadist who never raises his voice but speaks in near whispers (to show contained rage I guess--but it's a cliché).,2013

1,First of all this rant is going to be filled with SPOILERS so now you are warned. ,2013
1,"I hoped from the previews to see an exciting action flick with spectacular scenes, suspense, maybe some cleverness, heroism and victory in the end. Hyper violent, anti-North Korean war mongering overwhelmed any such values. North Korean ""terrorists"" are shown as brutal and ruthless as Nazis. American air defense is incredibly skimpy, incompetent and late. Our military leaders are weak saps who cave in to every terrorist demand with ""Oh, Pleeze don't hurt our President! We'll do what you want."" Our control of our own most potent weapons systems is easily overridden by one woman terrorist at a keyboard. The American SuperDuperHero single-handedly kills many of the terrorists and liberates the President. After killing the UberVillain, he even has a moment to put a bandage on the wounded President. That scene actually made me laugh.",2013
2,"Gerard, where did it all go wrong! I remember Butler as a good actor on his way to being great. He has the personality and the talent to do so much more with his craft. This was formulaic with an absurd plot - which constantly contradicted itself. The entire US foreign policy changed to save the President. No, don't think that would happen - you just get another President. A major sequence where they torture staff to get missile codes with the President vowing never to give his up - which he doesn't, but they somehow tap it into the computer anyway. Eh??? The fight scenes are beyond dumb, the assault on the white House - might appeal to a ten year old. The C140 attack, was so cringe worthy as to make me actually rise out the chair. The General in the control room!!! Stop it. And the flag waving cringeworthy speech at the end - do any Americans still buy into that type of faux patriotism. I so hope not.",2013
6,Olympus Has Fallen is yet an other US president oriented flick. A ton of action and special effects with almost as many logical flaws.,2013
7,"I find it ironic that Gerard Butler, a Scotsman, as disgraced Secret Agent Mike Banning, embodies the spirit of John McClane much more than Bruce Willis did in that last dreadful outing. If anything, Butler has done nothing more than to cement his reputation as a bankable and likable action hero for the new generation in this old-school action movie. He has a commanding presence on-screen, quips wisecracks, bleeds when it's crucial, and dispatches the bad guys in a methodical cross between Jason Bourne and John Rambo. Not even the fine supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott) can take away Butler's limelight.",2013
3,"Cliché, cheesy, inane, boring, predictable ... all could be used to sum up this horrible movie. It sucked, and I want my money back. Because this is America, and when things suck you should be able to get your $8 back.",2013
7,"Like Milius' Red Dawn (though not quite as accomplished technically), it's both completely indefensible substantively and yet a very enjoyable action film all the same. It knows what it is - jingoistic, idiotic drivel - but it's well shot and competently acted idiotic drivel if that makes sense. ",2013
1,"What can I say ? First of all congratulations Antonio Fuqua. Selling and getting BO profit from a production straight lifted or ripped down to last inane dialog from a B grade cheese flick you can rent from Blockbuster or Netflix is an accomplishment no one can deny. It is even more impressive to get positive reviews for this silly trash that takes itself seriously which makes it even more terrible. When this thing was called Air Force One everyone every critic ripped it apart. Only explanations Olympus Has Fallen getting a 7+ point in IMDb ( a rating system which I will never take care of ) after so many years can be decreasing IQ of mass movie going audience and insecurities of 9/11 on US public. Every dumb stupid over the top Die Hard action cliché was crammed in this production. A C-130 gunship entering restricted DC airspace before shot down from a safe distance beggars belief. Or highly trained Secret Service agents wasting ammunition on a fast flying armoured aircraft. Or same agents exposing themselves only to be mown down. North Korean terrorists ( yeah you read that right Korean ) are depicted more like Orcs or Klingons. Any actual Koreans watching this film would probably laugh his ass off. At least in Hollyland Number 1 villains are not Middle Easterns with cheesy Arab accents anymore. What else ? Fallen military trained lone wolf hero killing all of them one by one , meanwhile taunting evil mastermind ( who makes one of most ridiculous evil turnout / reveal scene just by taking glasses off. Rick Yune is just not Gary Oldman ) with US macho jargon and saves the day. Down to talking to his wife in the middle of war zone he basically screams ""I am a John McLane looka like no:10241."" Failed military strike to retake captured building to increase tension. Oh look only 3 seconds left to disaster...AAAAAND it is averted.",2013

2,"I was looking forward to watch this one and had high expectations without knowing that I would watch another obvious and typical American movie. I admit that the action was OK but there were too many stereotypes and plot holes. I am getting sick and tired of those kind of movies, in which the Americans save their world, their president and one man single-handedly takes down a gazillion enemies with just a butterknife. Don't you people realize that those happy endings with the president surviving and adressing to the nation are just pathetic? At the end of the movie I was hoping that that korean dude would make it and nuke the entire country but no oh no, the president gets shot and the one-man American army saves the world with three seconds left on the clock. Come on now. Even you Americans can come up with something better than that. I will start avoiding those kind of movies and rather watch CSI Miami reruns.",2013
1,"This film is dire. First 20-30 minutes are acceptable, just about. I hoped the movie may improve. Alas, I was wrong. The last 30 minutes are top drawer trash. The middle is, well trash as well Patriotism and propaganda it seems is ABSOLUTELY all Hollywood is about these days. I know Hollywood have always done their fair share for ""war"" efforts. However, with the Soviets no longer a threat and they've all but finished bashing the poor folks from the Arabian peninsula, now it's on to North Korea. One man, Yes ONE man, (American man of course) saves not just the day, but the president, not once but TWICE, saves his son to boot, plus he saves the White House (albeit in part). During the mayhem and chaos and one man army Heroics our man still finds time to make flippant calls on his ""cell"" to his beautiful wife; herself an all American Heroin working in the ER (blood smears and wide eyes cuteness to spare). The musical score is so trite and jingoistic it is vomit inducing - make sure you have a sick bag handy.

Secret Service agents disobeying protocol because the President said so (their job is to protect him from himself), running INTO gunfire instead of retreating to a defendable position, a plane making it to 30 min outside of DC without being picked up on radar (UM NO), hundreds of NK soldiers making it onto US soil without any explanation as to how they passed customs - and it KEEPS GETTING DUMBER. You can't watch this with your brain off because it keeps insulting you each time you try to. God it's not even good as background noise bc of how dumb it is.",2014
1,"There were so many ridiculous aspects to this movie, it is hard to name them all. An old clunker transport plane gets into the DC airspace and magically transforms to some high-tech piece of machinery, all within arm's reach of the US military planes...the lack of negotiation with terrorists is actually the US giving the terrorists everything they ask for. All so they will not kill our president. NO president is worth all that...Susan Sarandon's character reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as she is being dragged to her supposed death...the N Korean army of about 20 taking out all the secret service and US military...the use of a single gauze on an abdominal gunshot wound...Seriously, who wrote this crap??? It was abysmal, to put a positive spin on it.

I haven't seen any reviews that point out this glaring fact yet - if they're out there and I missed them, I apologize up front in the case of any repetition! Apparently, Steven Seagal was unavailable for the 3rd installment of the 'UndSeg' trilogy - he's probably busy with some mega-badass projects that call for lots of ponytails and squinting. So what did casting say?? Screw it!! Throw a Scotsman in there to save the American president! Gary Busey can't play the treasonous double-agent part again? No prob, just use Dylan McDermott instead...not as much of a maniac, maybe - but he was in Jersey Girl! Tommy Lee Jones too busy shooting commercials to lead an elite terrorist squad? Can we use a Korean guy instead??

7,"This is a fun film and nothing else really, this is just 2 hours of pure fun and sometimes that is good and this is one of those films. Ex Secret service member Michael Banning is the only man who can save the president of the united States from a North Korean Terrorist group attacking the white house. Gerard Butler is a good lead and is a great action hero with some one liners reminding me of a Die Hard film or an Arnold film. Aaron Eckhart is a great president and truly makes out like a president should be in a film like this in this situation. The Villain was good in his role as a seemingly generic terrorist and Morgan Freeman is great as the speaker and really does steal the show at a few points. The Story is pretty generic and really could be argued to be the biggest weakness as it really is as generic as possible and similar to previous films. Also the script is okay but it could have been better in these circumstances. The style though is really cool and the cinematography shows just how high the stakes are in this film and how important this film really is. Also the fact that this is an 18 means they take the violence up and it grounds this film in much more reality then films such as White House Down. This is a great action film and I believe that this is a good step for action films.",2014
2,"If you haven't seen ""Olympus has Fallen,"" DON'T! After the first thirty minutes--assuming you can get past that point--it's a mediocre action movie.

In the end, Banning has found his way into the bunker where the President is being held against his will by the Korean leader, Kang and rescues him.

2,Do you know what would happen if you blew up every single U.S. ICBM as it sat in its silo? No?

3,"It sucks that they had to put up a poster of this movie with Duke (Channing Tatum) and Joe (Bruce Willis) so grossly misleading when Duke showed up about what 10 mins or so then dies and Joe shows up when half of the movie is already finished, and not getting much burn at that (I should have known, how many of Willis's recent movies has been like this already). For an average movie goer like me (i'd like to think of myself like that) that doesn't normally go researching(goggling stuff) before watching a movie, I was sucked up by the poster itself expecting a whole lot of Duke and Joe in action. In my opinion, The Rock is not a bad actor himself but sadly he is not able to carry the movie by himself. I believe the movie producers/marketers or whoever is responsible for creating that misleading poster cheated people for their money. To be honest I am not sure I would be going to watch the movie in theater had I known I would be only getting this much, It's one of the movies I could have waited to be available on HBO\TV or on DVD. I did like the special effects though, especially the mountain action scenes.",2013
7,This second G.I JOE film doesn't have much in terms of a well thought out plot but it does have some great visuals and is packed with loads of well staged action sequences so action movie buffs should have a blast.

6,"As a film buff, I love seeing films alone on Saturday afternoons or Friday nights. As as result of my frequent attendance, I have come to know not to expect much from action blockbuster films. Yes, you get your usual incomprehensible hand-to-hand fights, buildings exploding and enemy gunfire as inaccurate as ever, with the inevitably minimal plot and screenplay. As the ending credits rolled, I stood up thinking ""ehhh"". The film definitely had some amazingly entertaining action sequences and awesome special effects, but you know, you can't really be THAT amazed with an action film. Not gonna lie, the screenplay in this film was pretty well written, and it included quite a few pleasantly surprising laughs. Dwayne Johnson has a big few months ahead of him with the release of Snitch (which I give a 7/10), the next Fast and Furious movie, and Pain & Gain. With this film, he did reinforce his true acting credentials, even though not much notable acting is observed in such a genre. All in all, if you're expecting something like Olympus Has Fallen, you might be dissatisfied. If you go in like me, with no true expectations other than hoping for some entertainment, you might like what you see.",2013

It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters, this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately, it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired.

I mean really ZARTAN SO MANY GREAT CHARACTERS IN THE 1ST MOVIE AND THEY PICK ZARTAN...... rip chord wtf really and no original joes why does Hollywood always screw up sequels. only movies like lethalweapon and die hard were able to do the action sequel why cmon stick to a story. in an economy like ours is right now I would not waste 10.00 to see this garbage movie. I am upset that I did I wqas so upset I walked out of the movie and demanded a refund. in closing if you have no previous wants from the last movie then watch good action but as far as G.I.

1,"I was absolutely disgusted with this film. It wasn't particularly offensive to any particular group (although the film's depiction of Muslims in one scene and the fact that every Asian character in the movie is a Ninja will likely raise a few eyebrows) so much as it was to its audience. The film expects the audience to believe outlandish scenes so long as there are explosions. The film is ""short""(although it feels long) but even with the film's length about 1/2 of the scenes are utterly pointless.

Luckily they kept Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, they are just as awesome as they were in the previous film, really enjoy the rival show of these two character.",2013

It's an action movie, its supposed to.

The bad- not that the leads are great actors, but back to back to back action set pieces leave little room for acting, the dialogs are as banal as they can get, and the climax is cartoonishly over the top.",2013

8,"The sequel to the first G.I.Joe movie gathered some negative reviews like its predecessor. This kind of thing doesn't deter me from watching any movie and one of the reasons is because you have to understand what kind of movie you're going to watch. I know that this is a mindless action flick with a simple plot. It's entertaining and it doesn't have to prove a point by being a perfectly constructed movie. It's meant to look cool and lack any real depth. After getting that out of my system, I can say that I enjoyed watching Retaliation and will try to watch it many times in the future, as this is the kind of film I watch when I wanna have fun. Ranging from The Rock to Willis this movie has very stylistic characters that ultimately kick ass with the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow battles coming to mind. The special effects also look impressive, particularly in one massive destruction scene. If you like to just lay back and see great fights and a little eye candy then this is the movie for you. Anyone trying to be logic about this I'll just tell you that you are wasting your time.",2014

9,I want to state that this review is from the view of a movie fan and fan of G.I.JOE and Hasbro Toys.,2013
1,"I came into watching this film under the premise that it was gong to be about the revenge of cobra commander. The first film ""The Rise of Cobra"" was very well done with incredible graphics, action sequences, and an encompassing plot that made sense and was consistent with the storyline. However in this film there wasn't a plot. The movie went in every direction without a singular purpose that made sense. Honestly the action sequence and graphics were incredible, but thats all the film offered. I never clearly understood the changes in setting. It was like beginning all the Joes die except a few. They plot the demise of the president. And Cobra attempts revenge. But other than that, I don't know what the plot was or why the director found it fitting to not make a plausible plot. I was very disappointed with this film and was hoping for even better performance than the first film.",2013
5,"I am not a die hard movie buff. I enjoy watching several different genres and have several favorite actors. But I would not say that I am a opening night have to see it kinda guy. Saying that I was excited that GI Joe was coming out with the second movie. I understood that many people didn't like the first one. I did not only because of the story line but also because of the special effects. (SPOILER) But killing off a top name actor in the first act is pretty much crap. Not only did you kill him off in the first act I didn't feel anything from the other Joe's. besides ""Johnson's"" little scene of him taking the dog tag. So you killed off a great actor and ""Duke"" one of the larger names associated with the toys and cartoon in the first act and never brought him back later in the story line or made his death mean anything...

Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes, was great, had character chemistry and interaction, a great line-up of Marvels best and usually got every character spot on (Even on one shot appearances). I looked forward to it each week. Avengers Assemble reminds me more of the Super-Friends than the Avengers. Bad call Mickey. I hope Avengers Assemble improves, it seems like a dumbed down version of the previous series or the film. They had a good thing going with Avengers: EMH and may want to assemble the old team.",2013
1,"This cartoon is inferior in every way to earth's mightiest heroes. The voice acting, the dialogue, the plot and even the character designs are horrible compared to EMH. Black widow looks terrible compared to the EMH version. I remember looking forward to each episode, because the characters were different from each other. They had personality. Here, they all seem to talk and act the same. What was the point of getting rid of such a good EMH team? They should have just continued with EMH, instead we get this crappy movie continuation instead of the excellent comic book stories of EMH (yes I know they were modified but it was amazing). I don't mind the movie. They had to do stuff in a 2 hour window but the cartoons can hold true to the amazing marvel legacy from the comics. No need to dumb it down to the movie level. I was so looking forward to this after EMH and it was an utter disappointment.",2013
2,"This new Avengers show just doesn't seem to mesh very well. Maybe because the previous Avenger cartoon (EMH) set the bar high but you would think the new one could come close. This new show equates more with the really old 90's version, where it's noise and colour, and poor story telling. The worst part for me is that gawd awful loud background music that's on almost all the time. It's like the story is not told well enough, so they have to cue the suspense music to tell the audience, 'yeah, it's exciting now'.",2013
1,"Just finished watching the first episode of this, and it was terrible. I know I shouldn't judge it so quickly and I will watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any better, but it will take a lot to change to make this a good show.",2013
2,"EMH was such an excellent series that could have gone on for a long time. They were setting up things like Guardians of the Galaxy, which I had never really heard of before and I am sure a lot of others had not heard of either. This is just continuing the movie. The movie does not really not need a follow up because of the MCU and MAOS that are continuing the stories in the movies and bringing it to TV. It seems that this is just a ploy to commercialize the franchise more and sell toys. I do not plan on following this series the same way I did with EMH. Disney XD is overall doing a poor job with their Marvel properties. Spider-man is alright but is also very much for kids. I agree with another review that I read that the voice acting and designs are terrible. This is more like the Super Friends than anything else.",2013
1,"Avengers Assemble is an anemic shadow of the series it replaced (the vastly superior Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes). AA's characters are flat and lifeless, its team dynamic is flat and lifeless, its animation is flat and lifeless, its dialog and plots... you get the idea.",2013
1,"There is no justification for calling this a continuation of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It isn't. It's a cartoon made after the film. The voices are subpar, especially in comparison to EMH. Most of the character's are absent despite Tony resuming the Avenger's Protocol in the first episode. Falcon becomes a noob when he was a seasoned veteran and fighter in EMH. Black Panther is gone, Ms. Marvel is gone, Wasp is gone, Henry Pym and Scott Lang, the list goes on. They worked as a team and were cohesive in EMH, whereas there's tons of unexplained artificial tension in Avenger's Assembled. Black Widow no longer has a Russian accent. I tried looking up a link or email to tell DisneyXD how unsatisfied I am with this garbage. I couldn't find an email for them. They should just make more seasons of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.",2013

1,"You know someone in power at marvel animation either really hates good cartoons or just plain doesn't care. Just like with Spectacular Spider Man the folks at marvel animation saw how much everyone loved Avengers EMH and canceled it in favor of a big stinky pile of capitalization. As if people who didn't know about avengers before the movie were going to be somehow too stupid to handle the slight departure that EMH was from the films, they decided to take away our beloved EMH in favor of an abysmal show that was more similar to the movies. I really REALLY hope that this show get God awful ratings and toy sales so whoever it is in charge of those moronic decision's either gets fired or learns their lesson. Notice I didn't describe the show at all? That's because its not worth a description. Bring back quality and drop this poop marvel. Ugh...",2013

1,"when i saw that this show was in production i was excited. seeing the art work for the posters gave me high hopes for the series. i read that it would spin off the movie but was sure it would not work that way. the marvel universe in the movie is just not big enough to sustain a show that would need many more characters and villains. so i was sceptically on the direction of this show. after seeing the pilot i realized that marvel animations will never be as good as dc animations. the writing is terrible, the dialog and jokes are terrible and shallow. the characters are weak and don't correlate to the characters in the movie or in comics. after a couple episodes i hope nothing but failure for this show so that the original material will not be ruined for future projects. Disney is really lazy with their television show animations and should take more pride in it. and the company should realize what they bought when they bought marvel.",2013
1,"Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes was very good, Avengers Assemble is dreadful. There is very little respect paid to the history of Avengers comics. There is a lack of intelligent writing and dialog in the show, and the fighting action is boring, unrealistic, and undramatic. The creators of this show have completely sold out Marvel Universe. The Avengers United They Stand series that ran on Fox in the 1990s was also good. Watch those series and I think you will agree with me about the huge drop in quality.",2014
10,"Wonderful show. I waited because all the reviews were so awful to watch this. But when I finally sat down and gave the show a shot i was shocked to find Avengers assemble so enjoyable, and let me tell you I was amazed that people hated the show so much.",2014
2,"I was saddened when I found out Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes was being discontinued as it was exemplary at representing the spirit and the mood of the Avengers along with being downright entertaining and intelligent. But this new show simply makes me depressed. It is awful. Awful writing, awful voice acting, awful directing. It assumes the viewer is an unfocused idiot with the maturity of a 4 year old (and there are shows for that demographic that are better). The animation is its only saving grace, not that it's so good, but that's it's slightly better than mediocre. ",2013
1,"OK, i've managed to suffer through 10 episodes so far... why would they cancel earth mightiest heroes for this??? so... 1. I agree with everyone, the show is dumbed down... no story arcs... almost every episode is independent of one another, so there is no need to see them all 2. The characters suck. They are all flat. You could interchange their dialogs and actor performances, and still it would not matter. Captain America is bland... Thor is practically a dumb blonde... Hulk speaks way too much... there are many missing characters. The bad guys also suck.",2014
1,"One would expect an improvement to what came before, but Avengers Assemble is clearly an impoverished and lazy mockery of Earths Mightiest Heroes.",2013
6,"So when i read that they will canceled Earth mightiest heroes i was angry,but anger washed away and was replaced by anxiety that they will ruined this show as they did with half of second season (first half was good but since they rushed everything rest of the season was overall awful) and i was right they did it.Every episode is for it self,they have to very little with each other.There isn't any story that will hold your attention and characters have lame background.Each episode as i said is story for it self,so far i don't see any link between episodes.Thats awful if they don't change that soon i will stop watching this.They did nice job with designing characters,world,CG effects are good,voice acting is excellent,combat scenes are good and that's all good points it has,everything else is bad.So my conclusion is 6.",2013
7,"I would suggest renting it, or perhaps buying it if the price is right. My final rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, and it deserves it! This movie has gotten me through some dark times. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. That said, the main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. I thought this was cute and not bad. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the voice actors. It will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy. Find it today, even if you don't like cartoons.",2014
10,"Yep! I've seen ""Avengers: Earth's Mightest Heroes"" once. It was great. But for Avengers Assemble was doing just very well. This is the show I really enjoyed. Like other heroes. Captain America, Black Widow, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and Falcon. Teaming up for the first time. Since that the animation was beautiful as it looks. Like they battle against the Cabal for the first time ever. I found this Avengers Assemble impressive marvelous. But I believe the show can do better. Well, for the moment. I really love that show that was great and it's doing just fine and it was excellent. I fount it very interesting since I've watch most of the episodes I've missed.",2014
8,"Some of the other reviewers need to look at the age limit on the show. It's recommended for age 7+ kids. It is not an adult superhero show and does not pretend to be. Yes, ""Avengers: Earth Mightiest Heroes"" was a better effort, but it's still fun to watch. Some of the plots and dialog are a bit over the top. But when you think about it, most superhero stuff is over the top. It's certainly okay if you are a fan of the Marvel Universe. Just enjoy and don't worry about it. Voice acting and music are okay, a nice array of villains are brought along, plenty of smashing and mayhem. Some of the other reviewers remarked about the level of damage done in the show?? Obviously you have not read any comic books in a while. There's always a roof coming down!! Like I said, just watch and enjoy!!",2014
4,"OK, I have only watched the first episode so maybe it gets better, I sincerely hope so, but for a pilot, it failed miserably.",2013

3,"So I wanted to get more into the animated Avengers shows, so I finished Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It was easily an 8.5-9/10, with great character development, amazing voice acting, a changing team, and an expanding Marvel universe. I absolutely loved it. I finally finished it, and I found that Avengers Assemble is a newer and more modern version, so I decided to give it a try, hoping that even if the art style is different, it would improve upon the near perfect show that was EMH. I was horribly wrong. This show is so awful honestly. Characters repeatedly pull off feats that normally wouldn't work but only do because of the fact that the writers can't figure out a way to solve the story without some awful plot device. There is next to no character development, only following what the Cinematic Universe has done, and even then what they did with it was unbelievably awful. Characters are extremely generic with no development or consistency to it. Even if the show is meant for younger children, you could watch Earth's Mightiest Heroes as a child and still enjoy it, because it didn't always try to take itself seriously, while Assemble clearly does. The art style might look better, but don't be fooled. Avengers Assemble is by no means an amazing show.",2015

2,"Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite series and I was so excited to see this movie. I've been to plenty of book-to-movie showings, so I knew not to expect the exact same thing, but regardless, I went in with high expectations. The beginning was... weird (and out of order, but that's just my OCD, no biggie). However, this movie was so horribly different from the book that it lost all of it's value. I don't just mean the events were slightly moderated to save time, I mean they changed the entire plot. Jace wasn't terrible- could've been cockier, Clary was horribly over-dramatic, Magnus was expressionless, and they managed to ruin my favorite character: Valentine. He became a bland, one- sided villain, unlike the ingeniously dynamic character Clare made him out to be. The movie had changes in it that ruptured the foundation of the book and a lot of what it stands for, ruining the ingenuity of the plot and the world that Clare built which had me so enraptured from the beginning. It's a shame because they had such potential with this movie. I still can't understand how they could take such a great story line and decide that it was only acceptable to warp it to a point beyond recognition....",2013

3,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it made me want to scream. I cannot forgive the scene where she freezes the demons. As a group, instead of killing the frozen demons, they walk through the demons and wait for them to unfreeze and have the demons kill the werewolves. Come on! They can kill off the werewolves with more demons. There are so many little things like that that just made the movie stupid for anyone who's older than 15.",2013

3,"I went to see this movie the other day and since I'm a big fan of the books I was all so excited to actually be able to see my fantasy on the big screen. But as the movie started playing everything went down the hill. They have changed basic dates which play a big part in the whole story since certain events happen at specific time and they actually change the whole story. With the exception of the funny poetry scene with Erik everything else was.. how can I put it politely? Bad. I couldn't even understand the feelings the characters were supposed to be feeling before they were spoken out loud. In the books there is a certain motive, communication-battle- communication-adventure, so you're able to understand what's going on. But in the movie you just don't get it. The movie itself is a spoiler, it gives way too much information which is supposed to stay hidden because it makes the upcoming story more interesting and breathtaking. ",2013

The plot not even close. Is like they took out everything in the fantasy/horror movies and tried to put it together in this one. Failed, failed miserably. What's with the vampires or werewolves ? where did they come from? why vampires are bad but WW are good ? What happened with the vampires ? who were they working for since they didn't show at the grand finally ? The characters have such a inconsistent background, one can't get their role at all. They just pop out with no explanation, they harm then help with no explanation, they do things without any explanation, and the movie ends that way. Terrible. That little friend zoned sob is bitten by vampires, what happened with that ? No explanation. I would stay away from this series and the books also. One star for the so close incest.",2013

Though, this seems like a trend with YA movies, beside Harry Potter I tend to see critics rip and tear apart teen movies like birds feasting on a dead carcass...I swear they all get together and decide to do it as a group. (just saying) Anyhow, I wouldn't say TMI was perfect, but it was the first in the series and I hope they get a chance to fix their minor mistakes and release City of Ashes.

I'm surprised to see so many positive user reviews on here , my advice is read the critics reviews far more accurate - no big blockbuster franchise here I for that I think we should all be very thankful , This is one strictly for young kids only !",2013

2,"You know, I really wanted to give The Mortal Instruments: City of  Bones﻿ a fair shake. I mean, it LOOKED like another Twilight clone...it  SOUNDED like another Twilight clone...it even FELT like a Twilight  clone. (Don't ask me how I know how it felt.) But, I was determined not  to judge a book by it's movie (ha!), and went to see City of Bones last  night.  It's a Twilight clone. And a terrible one, at that.  Listen, it's clear that this type of movie has an audience, and I am by  no means a typical member of that audience. On top of that, I am not  familiar at all with the books. But none of that should matter - a  movie should have enough merit to be watchable by anyone, even outside  of the usual demographic. And this was nearly UNWATCHABLE.  Let's try to do pros and cons. This should be fun...  Pros:   - Lily Collins, the main character and poor man's Kristen Stewart, was  also in Priest﻿...one of the lowest-scored movies in BDBOS history.  So...she's consistent.   - You know those people who ALWAYS say, ""The book was waaay better than  the movie""? Again, never read them myself, but I can't imagine the  books being ANY WORSE THAN THIS, so at least that will be an easy  argument to win.   - Lena Headey, aka 300﻿'s Queen of the Spartans, still gets to kick a  little bit of ass.   Cons:   - I've read that a considerable amount of the book was cut from the  movie, simply because it was impossible to fit everything into a 2-hour  film. I feel like whatever was cut from the book would have made a  better 2 hours of movie. So many plot holes, so many needlessly  unanswered questions, so many things that DON'T MAKE A GODDAMN BIT OF  SENSE.   - Twilight did this already. If you're a Twilight person, you've seen  this movie already. Awkward, ordinary teenaged girl, thrust into a  secret world where supernatural beings battle each other, and gaining  multiple One-Direction-looking love interests along the way. If you  told me that this movie was really called ""Twilight: The Other New  Moon's Eclipse At Dawn"", I'd believe you without argument.  - In God's name, WHY IS THERE AN IMAX VERSION OF THIS??? STOP IT,  Hollywood. It's hard enough to justify watching 2 dimensions of this  crap.   - This movie might actually be cheezier than Twilight. Terrible one-  liners, public shows of affection at awkward times, and a plot twist  that will make you feel REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE about things you saw  previously in the film.  - When the audience (which was practically empty in my theater, by the  way) starts laughing at parts of the movie that aren't supposed to be  funny...you have a problem.   - It's over 2 hours long...and you'll feel EVERY LAST MINUTE of it.  City Of Bones scores a 1 out of 5 on the BDBOS, and should not be  watched by human eyes. Vampires and werewolves should probably stay  away, too.",2013

4,"The plot is simple, predictable, and at times a bit cliché. It is easy to see where this movie borrows elements from other movies and even role-playing games. Character development gets tangled up in haphazard storytelling. At times the blatant exposition drags the pacing to a crawl and at other times it is rushed along with barely any time to absorb what is going on. In the midst of all this are a variety of interesting young characters, most of whom we hardly know. Even the three main characters could stand a bit more depth to make us care about their situation. The acting is fine, but certainly nothing noteworthy. The dialog is mostly smartly written and current, but that makes the occasional gaffe really stand out. Visually this looks more like a television production than a theatrical release, and many of the demonic effects show a lack of either talent or budget. Overall, I would rather re-watch an episode of Buffy or Angel, or even Teen Wolf than this again, but it's not awful. If you like clichéd teen romance with a bit of supernatural/fairy tale parental drama, you might really enjoy this, but for most folks who like supernatural adventure movies there are a lot of better options available.",2014
7,"I almost always agree with the critics, but this time. Yes, it has a lot of plot holes. And, yes, its climax isn't that worthy of applause. But this might be the first time you had so much fun with a newcomer since The Philosopher's Stone. And, curiously, it has almost the exact same flaws of the first HP movie: it doesn't know where it will lead, it has the pressure of being exactly like the book and kinda needs the support roles to make the movie a solid picture. ",2013
1,"Okay, let's begin with the premise of the story. It does not have one and quite honestly, i am surprised an actress would allow herself to be humiliated like this in the name of acting. As a previous actor, this is one of the reasons I got out of the industry is the fact that these type of films would not be considered over the top but the industry will censor some crude language???",2017
1,"Where to start? Watching Nymphomaniac, both volumes, is like going to an art show where feces is displayed, and everyone is standing around discussing the contours, layers, lighting, and you're standing quietly thinking to yourself, "" I must be missing something. This is art! Isn't it?"" Basically, the story of emperor's new clothes at its finest. I will be bold enough to say that no, I'm not missing anything. It really is just sh** I'm looking at. My final thought at the end of both volumes was ""wow, those are hours I'm never going to get back."" And it's not that the movie was all bad. Charlotte is wonderful, as are all the other actors. The topic is interesting. I didn't mind the nudity and I wasn't offended by any of it. There just isn't any point to it at all! None. Just when you think there may be some point in the friendship she develops with an asexual male, the story stuffs that thought into the toilet in the most confusing unnecessary way. Or when you think there is some point to her love story with Jerome, that is trashed in a very stupid way too. And if the director thinks that he is building up, just to let us down, well, he fails to build anything up since the whole movie is so boring and monotone. There just no point. And if the point of the movie is that there is no point, then why the Hell am I stuck staring at the screen for so long? Anyways, I am utterly disappointed. This is poop. ",2015
1,I have written quite exhaustive review of this movie but Socialist State of IMDb kinda prohibits some words - but in a very Kafkaesque manner does not explain which ones. That's somewhat unfortunate as the movie Nymphomaniac can only be described by words that describe some mature content activities. I mean some really depraved mature content activities.,2016
1,Whilst watching Nymphomaniac I found myself often intrigued but when it was over I wondered what I got out of watching it ultimately. It all didn't really go anywhere if you ask me.,2014
2,"The characters all end up committing heinous acts that throughout the runtime of two films would lead you to think is completely unlike them at all. Not only is the final act a giant figurative middle finger to the audience, but it also decides to give all the characters completely new personalities just to be able to create a shocking ending. What is so infuriating about the ending, is that there was no built-up or anything suggesting that the characters were capable of doing these acts. It is not as if only one character were to do something that is ""outside of their character,"" but it is pretty much everyone in the movie decides to do something completely unlike themselves all at the same time, just to be able to have an unsatisfying climactic conclusion. Other than the final act, the other scenes also seem to delve more into fetishism instead of focusing on the central ""problem,"" which is her sex addiction (or nymphomania). The movie rails off into an unwanted territory and brings all 4+ hours of these two volumes to not only a disappointing ending, but also an ending that is insulting to its audience.",2015
2,"I'm going to keep it straight to the point. Just when I thought, after vol. 1 that it couldn't get worse, along comes the nadir of blackness and utter hopelessness. I know Von Triers from ""Dancer In The Dark"", a film that I liked but found nearly unbearable to watch and only saw once and never want to see again. I recognize the talent, however, and braced myself for another helping. Little did I know what I was really in for. The bottom line is that these films depict a world inhabited by people that are desperately and hopelessly doomed. I've never seen such nihilistic portrayals in my life. I'm all for ""realism"" in films but I don't want to be thrown into the ""real lives"" of these people....no, no a thousand times no! Their world is so bleak and hopeless and devoid of any affection or warmth or light that it simply looses any sense to it. The lives of these people have not an iota of the elements that make living worthwhile so once that's realized, after about a minute, it becomes pure torture. I pride myself on my level of tolerance for the fetishes and idiosyncrasies that people have but sheer brutality is something that I know exists but care not to be thrown into in brutal graphic detail. These are the most bleak and depressing films ever made to my knowledge.",2016
3,"As much as the first part held a plot of the history and background of a sex addiction to some extent,Vol 6 just hurt my eyes and ears and bored me to sleep. The drastic images of self-abortion and self- inflicted pain, as well as the vulgar sex scenes; I am not a qualified psychologist/psychiatrist, but it all seems a little vague and improbable to me. It is sort of upsetting that a film spiked with such great cast (from Charlotte Gainsbourg, Shia LaBeouf, Uma Thurman, Stellan Skarsgaard and Willem Dafoe) brought such poor outcome. Changes between the young/old characters for Joe and Jerome did not work for me either - the plot lost out on even more of its scarce credibility. The film looks like a clueless mix of shocking images and cliché philosophical statement, and the poor, predictable and almost annoying finale made me want to score it a 1/10 initially.",2015

1,Nymphomaniac Volume II failed to satisfy my taste despite the fact that it has sex and porn.,2014
3,"Lars von Trier. If you know the name then you're aware of the avant-garde, ambiguous style he produces in every feature film he's made. Nymphomaniac, with its two parts and 240 minute running time, has its cast practicing real sex acts. It's the sole reason why this film has garnered so much attention. Overlooked is everything else in between. Joe (Gainsbourg) tells her tale of emotional and physical highs and lows to Seligman (Skarsgard), a dutiful, friendly fellow that helps her after an assault. Her life's story is split up into metaphorical chapters, from the moment she finds her sexuality as a young girl, up to present day. Gainsbourg is a fine example of ideal casting, looking the part before baring any skin. Her story telling is clunky and disjointed. Lars von Trier's scriptwriting is dry, elusive and as ambiguous as a white canvas. The C word's blurted out more times by Gainsbourg than seen, grating like nails on a chalkboard. The acting's authentic, by all accounts (most notable is Stacy Martin playing young Joe), but only when dialogue is absent (Shia LaBeouf's accent is diabolical). The scenes that contain nudity represent nymphomania. Porn's toes are not being trod on. Nymphomaniac's easier to digest than other LvT films. Some viewers may feel short changed and a little underwhelmed, both physically and emotionally, by the end.",2015
3,"Overall, I thought the first one was okay. Even though a majority of the time I was bored with the story, I did think it was somewhat interesting and I felt the acting was very good in it. I also felt the real sex element of the film was nothing more than a gimmick to create buzz but it wasn't so bad that it tossed me out of the film. However, I didn't really feel the same in the second installment.",2014
2,"Nymphomaniac 2 Now I liked the 1st film but this one? I couldn't get away with I think this one makes you realize that the character has no emotion or remorse for what she does and then the writer tries to shock us by comparing Paedophiles to Nymphomaniacs and in my eyes trying to justify the 1st of the two is unthinkable stating that 95% of them will live with it without anyone ever knowing and not acting out their fantasies! (No these people are monsters) I think he has gone on for full on controversy by trying to defend it, but apart form that the film is not as strong as the 1st part with a pretty poor ending which lets it down.",2014
3,"I'm torn. I think I got maybe some deep thoughts and themes out of this movie, but on the other hand I'm disturbed and disgusted. If I have to rate it as a drama then maybe a 3 or 4. As porn.... I don't know. Don't watch porn so don't know if it was a good one or not. Yes, it can be arousing at some moments, but then something happens that changes the direction of the story. I guess it's hard for people like Joe. If I would be a nymphomaniac I would be a bad one because of my shy personality. I would die just because I couldn't get sex and that would drive me mad, probably. In the ending she could have just hit the old man to knock him out and run away, don 't think that there was a need to shoot him. But maybe he deserved it.",2014
2,"But, this is a two part movie, each of which were around 1:50 minutes each. I could barely sit through the first half, I had to stop 2 minutes into Volume II. I love the way his films are shot, they look amazing. But watching 2 hours of a movie, with a plot that basically doesn't exist in my eyes. Just a lot of sex scenes and talking. If you want to watch this to see the nudity and/or sex scenes, it's really not worth it. I have no idea why people think Lars is such a good filmmaker. This movie was a complete waste of time. The only redeeming factor is that he pushes the envelope by putting scenes of sex scenes that are not simulated. You're better off watching some free porn on the internet. Don't waste your time with this garbage.",2014
3,"Must say, even in the first part I did anticipate this ending, but wanted to believe he will not be as predictable and quit frankly bad tasted. SPOILER!!! ",2014
3,"Now we come to the second half, the light and brisk tone turned into darkness and intense.The volume II completed itself to a whole encyclopedia of sex, basically it encompass some most hitted genre of pornography, the heartrending yet anticipatory breakup with Shia and her son, the grotesquely sadistic sexual experience(Jamie Bell is a seductive rising star I think he looks extremely authoritative even in a gray sweatshirt), the lesbian trans-generational sexbut I have to say the second half chose the WORST ending. I almost felt Lars's ineptitude of finishing this overly ambitious and kaleidoscopic of nymphomania.",2014
3,"I dispute what appears to be the central contention of this movie - that Jo simply exercises her inherent right to find fulfillment in any way she deems necessary. Behavior like hers is the reason we have courts and a legal system. Also, her character's lack of a moral compass reflects directly in her partial downfall near the end of the movie.",2017
1,"If you like shocking films, then you will love the rating of this film,  as the only truly shocking thing here is how on earth it has achieved a  score of over 7/10.  This is the sort of rating that makes you think that the human race is  genuinely a lost cause. That devolution is no longer a theory, but a  reality.  What would be useful is to see an 'average age of user review'  alongside this score. If it is above 14, then I wish to play no further  part in this world.",2014

1,This movie is not better than Volume II.,2014
3,"Lars is one of those directors that is emphasis the freedom of speech and tries to be controversial. However sometimes, there is a limit to that. And I am not one of the viewers that nitpick or makes a big deal out of this in movies. But this one really pushes the limit with it's messages about how pedophiles deserve a medal for not giving into the desires with action. Seriously what the crap man? I feel the second part was just not really necessary and really could have combined it into a 3 or so hour movie. This is the spiraling downward story of Joe and it really drags a lot. I am not sure if the main goal for Lars was to bore and make the audiences depressed a great deal through this volume, but if so it does the trick. The dialogue this time around is also really boring and lost it's somewhat interesting flare that the first volume has. The message seems to be that there is no hope, people are all selfish hypocrites even the ones trying to do the right things, there is not point in caring for others because people are crap. And that is what this movie seems to come down to. I am cool with people being entitled to their own opinions although I may disagree. But this Vol is all about shock factor, but it just got boring and annoying really quickly and just wanted it all to end. Even if it has a crappy ending. Now when it comes to the ending of this movie, some critics seem to feel that it's a betrayal and a middle finger to the audiences. I actually re-watched certain scenes to see if there is any symbol or messages that I might have missed that leads to the ending. And not really, the ending really is a cop out. It's like Lars was inspired by movies like ""Irreversible"" or ""Man Bites Dog"" and was like Lars was thinking ""I can't let this movie have a somewhat happy ending, it needs to end with a tragedy. Even if that tragedy is just smacked on there because I am all about melancholia"". Maybe he just wanted to shock the audiences one last time, like you know it's coming but giving hope to the audiences and then crushing it. Some say Seligman was trying to sacrifice himself others say it's to show the unavoidable power of sexual desire and hypocrisy as the human condition. Knowing a bit about Lars, it would have to be the latter.",2014
10,"NYMPHOMANIAC is the most exciting, intelligent film I have seen in a long time. The moment I saw Seligmann shuffle out of his apartment to Rammstein, I knew I was in the hands of a filmmaker I could trust. This scene was the first of many at which I found myself exulting inside. GO, LARS, GO! NYMPHOMANIAC is von Trier's F-14 and he takes it on bombing run after bombing run, destroying a different pious hypocrisy each time. The film is full of all sorts of audacious touches that no other filmmakers working today have the guts or brains to include in their boring, sentimental, ideological films. ",2014
4,"...to the point where a gore-fest like this reset of ""The Evil Dead"" series failed to impress me. Sadly, mindless Grand Guignol appears to be still popular, and the profit margin of this one will undoubtedly spawn a sequel. More's the pity. Truthfully, the ensemble acting from a quintet of relative unknowns is passable, the DP work from Kiwi Aaron ""Spartacus: War of the Damned"" Morton is quite nice, and certainly the goo and gristle are up to snuff (been looking for a place to stick that pun for awhile), but unfortunately it's all in the service of tyro auteur Fede ""Yes, my first feature film!"" Alvarez' pedestrian script and workmanlike-at-best direction. Others are apparently also to blame for the script, including Diablo ""Juno"" Cody, and likely should be held equally responsible---small recompense to the viewer, though.",2013
7,"So I've read here and there that this remake lacks the camp of the original. And I look back over 20 years ago, watching The Evil Dead on a crummy rental VHS, in the dark of my teenage bedroom one night. The camp? The original Evil Dead was a terrifying experience, even with Bruce Campbell's over the top performance, the film was a scare-fest, a terrifying trip even nearly ten years after its release. The camp was in Evil Dead 2, an horror comedy remaking the original already, technically. ",2013
5,"There are two ways to watch the 2013 version of Evil Dead. If you weren't watching horror in the eighties then you'll probably view this as a competent little horror flick. The acting is decent, as are the special effects. There are a few bits that make you jump and other scenes are reasonably creepy. Therefore, you may conclude that, if you were looking for a decent horror film, then you have found one.",2014
10,"I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).",2013
1,"This movie is very easy to summarize : If you're an Evil Dead fan who loved the previous parts (and part 1 especially) : avoid this like the plague. If you've never seen any of the other Evil Dead flicks : you're in for an average horror movie with bad acting, poor dialogue and a thin storyline filled with loopholes.",2013

1,"I just finished watching this movie and I'm just sitting here wondering how and why this movie even got made... It is probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. It honestly has no coherent plot except what it ripped from the original (which I don't understand who decided that movie needed a remake because it's an amazing classic). The characters in this movie are some of the stupidest I've ever seen. Honestly, all of them deserved to die. So when you find a book that's bound in human flesh your FIRST instinct is to read from said book? Oh your sister is possessed by a demon and is basically infecting everyone with it but let's not kill her because she starts singing a song from your childhood? You want to go down in the basement with her even though she's killed practically everyone? I didn't root for any of these characters. Whenever the possessed people would talk I found myself just laughing because it was so forced. It's like they were trying to be scary and intimidating but it just came off like characters from Scary Movie. The actors in this movie have the intelligence of a bag of rocks and the acting range of Kristen Stewart. ",2013
2,There are definitely more but here is at least 10...,2013
1,"Remake or not, this film is an absolute bore. It seems the director spent more time getting nice looking shots rather than focusing on performances that should propel the narrative, which they don't. Far from it. The problem starts with the screenplay, which is just dumb, since the focus is on character development, a useless tool if the performances aren't directed well enough. The cabin and the woods is simply not a character as it is in the original, there are minutes of boring dialogue at the cabin before they even open the door. It is gory, but it has little affect since the performances are so terrible that the audience couldn't give a damn if they die or not. Decent work with CGI gore but still not convincing enough. No special makeup effects (appliances). Unlike other remakes (dawn of the dead, the Texas chainsaw massacre) that actually REMAKE the majority of the film, the Evil Dead seems to slightly deviate from the original screenplay, making it difficult to watch without comparing it to the original masterpiece. Mise-en-scene is bland, the props are lame, especially the necronomicon, and the cinematography is lacking if you consider Raimi's experimentation in the original. Overall, this film has no character, no soul, and no dark humor.",2013
2,"Why why why why why did I get excited for this film? Why do I keep doing this to myself? A horror remake with modern gore effects and a fresh take on the best the eighties have to offer. It has to be a winner right? WRONG! This is the latest in a long line of horror remakes that just fails in almost every dept. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Halloween. Elm street. Omen. Hills Have Eyes. I Spit On Your Grave. The Fog. Fight Night. Friday 13th. Amityville. I kid you not, i paid to see them all. Lined up for pre screenings or opening midnight showings. Always excited. Always disappointed afterwards. In many cases, I was more gutted than the slasher victims on screen. The only two remakes that were decent was The Thing prequel and The Crazies.",2013
1,"SHAME RAIMI SHAME!! Sam, why would you risk your outstanding legacy by attaching yourself (loosely), to this utter shemozzle?!? Clearly you were offered a few bucks to help promote this film and give it some credibility, but is money worth more than credibility? Reputation? Respect?!?! I could say the same about Bruce Campbell, but he has never been more than a B-actor, (though still totally awesome), and thus I understand his desire to make a quick buck, but Sam....you have no excuse.",2013
1,"Far too much emphasis on blood and gore effects at the expense of quality acting, coherent writing, addictive story, skillful direction and genuinely horrific shocks.

1,I cant stand why Hollywood do the movie and call the remake when not like first movie. This called Evil Dead but it not Evil Dead like first Evil Dead. It normal cheap horror movie with the cabin and the blood. It have normal the teenager and normal the bad acting. Normal the gore and normal the one survivor hero who kill the badness. That is OK because that is normal. But it not Evil Dead. Why they try and lie to the people by saying it is remake? It not the remake. It only have one or two thing in first movie like necromonicon the chainsaw and girl in the basement. Everything else is different and not the Evil Dead. No laughing in the movie like other the Evil Dead. No the scares and the fright. Just gore to cover story not in.,2013

But have heard only positive things about the remake I had my doubts. At last, after a lot of stupid remakes this one kicks you straight in the face. In fact, it's based on the original one. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved in making this flick and Fede Alvarez (the director) did a great job for his first full feature.",2013
1,"Extremely sickened by this film. I have never sat through a film where I simply wanted it to end. Graphic sickening torture porn for soulless sociopaths. No story to speak of, which the original had in spades. Amateur acting, with nobody approaching the charisma and screen presence of Bruce Campbell. All this film had was buckets and buckets of cow blood and pointless violence. That's all it was. Pointless violence.",2013

The Fright Night remake actually did a decent amount of justice for its source material. But then, you stop and realize how short Hollywood has come up in terms of original ideas and cool scares. Nowadays it seems to be a) remakes b) torture porn c) possession movies(these have got to go) d) more remakes. Heck, the last original and clever horror movie I saw was Cabin in the Woods, which was actually a horror themed comedy rather than a true horror film.",2013
2,"This movie was laughable at best. I was actually very excited to see this and brought friends with me, I had to apologize to them. This movie was the pinnacle of wasted potential. I have to admit it started of well, just because it had maybe 2 or 3 good jump scare scenes. The rest of the movie was just a downward spiral of crap fueled by gallons upon gallons of low budget watery Kool-Aid blood, a very dumb plot, pointless dialogue, some unnecessary expository info, atrocious plot holes, and ridiculous plot contradictions. It was hard to tell what was getting more butchered, the actors or the Evil Dead Franchise.",2013
1,It's interesting how the budget for the original was around 3 hundred- thousand dollars and this movie's budget was around 14 million dollars and the original was exponentially better simply because the had to try back then. I think if the budget for this one had been barely a million dollars it would have delivered but instead it just delivered another rehash of the same movie that has been released every few months for the past several years; stupid characters you care nothing about getting involved in something that will lead to their demise in the most unrealistic manner the director can come up with.,2013

3,"This film is not worth seeing. First of all, for being ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience."", it was not scary at all. I was more scared by Disney's Bambi than this movie. Another problem is that there was not one moment where I could not see what was coming. It was incredibly predictable. The effects do look great, and are the only thing that merit a 3/10 review. Some scenes were utterly disgusting and stupid. A lot in this movies was laughable, It's almost as if they were begging to be mocked by Scary Movie 5. The characters are OK, but there isn't much bond built between them and the audience. Most things that happen are ridiculous. At one point a man is stabbed directly in the heart, shot with nails, and then continues to survive for 40 more minutes in the movie. There was no tension, just death, more death, blood vomit, creepy voices, death, blood, death. THAT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE, no buildup at all. The music half the time was a rip-off Hans Zimmer and the other half was a incredibly annoying WWII bomb siren. Did not feel original at all, very generic, possibly the least original movie I've seen in a long time. So in review, if you like not at all scary movies, with annoying music, disgusting violence, stupid demons and characters, and wasting $10 to see it in theaters, by all means see this movie.",2013

8,"Don Jon was very well-received in its regional premiere at the Paramount Theatre during Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was written, directed and starred Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He did a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut, but he may have been trying to do too much. The acting by Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, and Brie Larson is quite good. I think it is Gordon-Levitt's script that leaves something to be desired. His character Jon is a very successful ladies' man who is also heavily addicted to masturbating to internet porn – numerous times daily. Many people will find the film to be quite funny and enjoyable. However, the graphic use of porn will not be to everybody's taste and may be off-putting to viewers – particularly female viewers. I'm also wondering whether the extensive use of porn will lead to the MPAA giving it the kiss-of-death NC-17 rather than an R rating.",2013
10,"(Somewhat Spoiler-y) I've dated an older woman, and in a lot of ways she tried to tell me the same things Esther tells Jon. In fact I remember a few distinctly similar interactions, so on that level the movie really spoke to me.",2013
7,"Defining what kind of film this is had to be the hardest part of getting DON JON made, but ultimately it was worth it! It isn't really a ""guy"" film even though *technically* it tries to look at sex from a guy's perspective. It may actually best be called a ""chick"" flick, but one they would see alone rather than with a date. At the screening I saw, ALL the raucous laughter was coming from very obviously female voices - falling out of their chairs laughing over what they viewed as stereotypical male behavior - and even as the supposed ""10"" played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself to be the kind of demanding (insert the word for a female canine here) who a very stupid - make that excessively immature - straight boy (like the one played with supreme élan by author/director Gordon-Levitt) would make a fool of himself over! ",2013
7,"I saw this at a pre-screening for SXSW and I was really impressed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really holds his own as a writer/director, and it was nice to see him in a role I hadn't really considered him ""right"" for. Scarlett Johansen and Julianne Moore are both wonderful as well. Basically, you should see this if you get the chance. It's funny, charming, different, and tells a great story that ends up going in a direction I hadn't anticipated.",2013

Over the years, he's starred in such films as Brick, The Dark Knight Rises and Looper, and has proved to be the type of actor whom everyone loves - and who actually deserves that love.

After meeting Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jon falls in-love and struggles to choose between her and his addiction.",2013
10,"Don Jon, was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar, raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on, turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes, the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it, but it has some reason to, seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film, soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film, Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately, I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it, it is out, so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon, did have a lot to say both about young men and women, sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women, he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect, beautiful and however you want to put it, but other than just looking at it, there is no real connection, or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling, or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman, he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film, our lead character, Jon, meets two very different women, who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times, is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young, or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon, is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman, but right from the start we do not really like her, or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit, or care for her to know, but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time, this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect, or just like it is on movies, magazines, or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality, relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose acting has impressed me over the years, especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act, but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts, or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men, women and relationships in general. As the film ended, I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt, decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character, but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes, I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter, but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship, or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt, and as it stands Don Jon, is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.",2013
8,"""It's not that I can't stop I just figure why should I...it's not like I'm cheating on her."" Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame. Overall, a very well done and good movie that won't be given a chance by many people because of the subject. I give it a B+.",2013
10,"First of all, I'm a female and I'm not really into sexual things, porn, etc., but I understood the movie. John(played by the handsome Joseph- Gordon Levitt) is a typical New Jersey guy, who is obsessed with sex in general.He's addicted to watching porn to that point where he prefers it rather than real human interaction. He has his regular routine that you can see him doing over and over again. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) and at first she's playing hard to get and you can clearly see that she's mocking him. I didn't quite understand why she got so mad about the fact that John watches porn. Esther (Julian Moore)takes a very important part in the movie. At first she seems nothing more than a crazy old lady, but then she completely changes John's point of view. She teaches him the difference between love and sex. Overall I think this movie is genius and really carries a message.The acting is brilliant as well.",2014
7,"There is no doubt that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. He has impressed me in his past roles in Brick and Inception. In this movie he portrays a twenty-something from New Jersey who grows as a person from an immature kid into a man. The movie started off very strong for the first 25-30 minutes, with Scarlett Johansson doing an admirable job as his New Jersey girlfriend. I particularly liked how the pervasiveness of sexuality in the media was shown. From the Hardy's commercial to various music videos and models on TV. The rest of Don Jon's family were also great, and I wish we could have spent more time at the dinner table with them. Julianne Moore played a much larger role than I had originally expected, and did a great job helping Jon grow as a person.",2013

I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very credible Jersey womanizer and an even more credible lost soul. Until...",2014

Marky-Mark's Good Vibration serves as a very apt soundtrack to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut Don Jon, as the dramedy immerses itself within the art of adult entertainment If you're not quite with me, never mind.",2013
8,"WoW! I am writing this review as a way of crediting Joseph Gordon-Levitt (JGL) for his ambition as a director. We all know him for his stellar performances as an actor in movies such as Mysterious Skin and Looper as well as the Nolan masterpieces Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. he has a great career going on there as he has repeatedly proved to be one of Hollywood's most versatile performers – he can play the villain, he can play the mastermind, he can play the sweetheart here he has chosen to mime a dumb, incredibly superficial Don Juan of the 21st century. The main character Jon is certainly not on the bright side. he keeps his life restricted to the same patterns and the same schedule as ever: working as a bartender, hitting on attractive women and getting them to bed, working out at the gym, going to church and confessing his sins and watching a lot of internet porn. It is the last-mentioned occupation that this movie revolves around, which is kind of revolutionary in itself. How do you make a movie about a topic as sordid and yet ordinary as internet porn? You have to give it to JGL – he had had an idea there and explored it thoroughly to come up with a film that investigates the consequences of excessive porn consumption. For Jon, it has become unquestioned everyday routine to raid the internet for porn whenever he feels the need. Thus, he jerks off multiple times every day and even does it after he banged a hot girl. When he gets emotionally involved with particularly attractive Barbara, played by Scarlet Johansson, he is – for the first time – confronted with the idea that his porn addiction might be something bad. But not only Jon clings to stereotypical images- his girlfriend has a hard time challenging her own romantic ideals, which are basically epitomized by corny Hollywood tearjerkers. This is a clever arrangement by JGL which endows the movie with a depth and reflectiveness you would not expect from a comedy with this plot line. The logical synthesis that transforms Jon into a decent human is represented by Esther, fabulously played by Juliane Moore. Jon comes across her during his evening courses at university and is clearly not interested at first, because she is much older and probably not attractive enough for him. However, the lady does not let go of him and tells him truths he cannot stand to hear . at first.",2016

8,"Addiction is the sweetest lie that pulls us under, but we don't realize that we're drowning. Instead, we dream the sweetest dream, perfection, but one will rock the boat, stirring waves of conflict and control. We struggle to gain what we had, but it still slips between our fingers. And somewhere in-between, a heart is beating, waiting to be noticed, and a catching glance notices. Two lives drift closer against the waves of despair and tragedy, and two hearts become one. And addiction is the sweetest lie obliterated by good vibrations, but the story does not end here for there is no happy ending because nothing ever ends. And love is only the beginning.",2014

9,"This film depicts story of a deeply flawed young man struggling to turn his life around. The movie reveals the generous good-hearted nature of Oscar, on whose life the story is based. The awards the film has won are well deserved, as the film-maker succeeds in presenting an unsparing look at Oscar's many failings even as he humanizes this young man whose life is largely unknown to the American public. In a quite amazing fashion, all of this is done through the lens of a single day in Oscar's life, with only the aid of one brief flash-back.",2013
10,"I knew nothing about the true story behind this film before I saw it but Ryan Coogler did an impressive job of telling this controversial story. Coogler takes us to the last day in 2008, and introduces us to Oscar Grant's life. A young, troubled father that is trying to do the right thing by his family. This was his debut at Sundance and he didn't disappoint. The audience laughed when the actors laughed and shed tears when the actors shed tears...it was a very moving film. By the end of the film I felt as though I knew these people personally. The whole cast did an excellent job! I'm looking forward to hearing more about Ryan Coogler in the future.",2013
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not politically correct to criticize this movie, but it seems only fair to treat it as I do every other movie on which I comment. If that sounds like a bashing is coming, you are mistaken. In fact, this is an emotionally-charged, well written and exceptionally well-acted movie that provides much anticipation for the future projects of its first time director Ryan Coogler. However, in my opinion, it is also flawed in its ""Based on a True Story"" placard that is then followed by much manipulation (3 Oprah references), some of it even bordering on misleading.",2013
9,"Based on the true story of one of the most heart wrenching instances of police brutality in American history, Fruitvale Station humanizes Oscar Grant, a victim of senseless police violence and racial profiling. This film does not paint him as a saint nor does it paint him as a crook, it shows him as a human being with many flaws. Michael B. Jordan gives an electrifying performance as Oscar Grant. He doesn't miss a single step and delivers a performance that has solidified him as a force to be reckoned with on screen. The film, as a whole, works but not for storytelling. This is a film that has great performances and that keeps it above average on many levels. If there was anyone else playing these roles, especially Jordan, I feel as if the film wouldn't pack as much of a punch. Ryan Coogler directs the hell out of his actors and does a fantastic job keeping pace. Running at just below an hour and a half, the film moves. It doesn't drag, it doesn't lack, it is a beautiful and moving portrayal of a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and the decisions that he made to put him at Fruitvale Station on that fateful night.",2013
8,"An independent film written and directed with stunning effectiveness by newcomer Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station is based on a true story, and even though its story of an unarmed black male who is shot on New Year's Day, is pulled from national headlines, the film is a character study of the choices in life and how a cruel twist of fate intervenes. It lingers in the heart and mind long after the end, and as such is one of the best films of the year.",2013

Haunted by the Newtown school shooting, the Aurora theater shooting, as well as countless local and minor shootings, American lives have been turned upside-down on numerous occasions. Somehow, one recent shooting almost seems to have been buried by the others. That shooting is the tragic death of Oakland citizen Oscar Grant on New Year's Eve, 2008. Five years later, first time director Ryan Coogler brings this story back to the public eye with Fruitvale Station, a heart-wrenching drama that is sure to leave you misty-eyed.",2014
9,"""Fruitvale Station"" is not the feel-good movie of the year. Nevertheless, I think you should stop at this station to witness the impact that this movie throws at you. The film is based on the true story of Oscar Grant, 22-year-old Bay Area resident, who crosses paths with friends, enemies, family, and strangers on the last day of 2008. Grant was accidentally killed by a police officer at the Fruitvale BART station. The officer was part of a group of policemen who held Grant and his friends at the station for fighting with others in a train. This unfortunate event did not get the headlines that the Trayvon Martin case did, but was just as sad because a young life was taken away way too soon. Writer-Director Ryan Coogler orchestrates ""Fruitvale Station"" primarily on Grant's last day with his family, girlfriend, and friends; instead of just simply taking the ""plight for justice"" road. Consequently, that gives the movie more depth and authenticity. Coogler's scribe of the picture was not as impressive as his direction but still gets the word out on doing what is right not just for one's own sake but for their loves ones; and of course, he also disseminates the message on the unjustified death of Grant. Michael B. Jordan's starring performance as Grant was a slam dunk; and let me tell you it was no lay-up due to the nature of the complex character he had to portray. Jordan completely disappeared into the role. There were also some impressive supporting turns from Oscar-winner Ocatavia Spencer as Grant's mother Wanda, and Melonie Diaz as his girlfriend Sophina. ""Fruitvale Station"" does get overdramatic at times, but it does have justifiable reason to do it. So you might want to take a hanky, but I think this movie is one that should be on your track to witness. ***** Excellent",2013
8,"Seldom do we remember in our desensitized 24-hour news society that behind every headline, every momentary tragedy, and every affected victim there's always a personable human story that reveals the true layers of heartbreak once exposed for all to grasp, understand, and mourn. One example in particular of modern headline tragedy was the senseless,unwarranted shooting of 22-year old Oscar Grant by police officers at the Fruitvale BART station that reinvigorated a debate on prejudice and a call for civil rights that unfortunately lead to some violent protests in the aftermath. This heated headline event is the subject of 26-year old filmmaker Ryan Coogler's debut feature entitled Fruitvale Station that is a relatively solid first film depicting the importance of family, the rarity of second chances, and the difficulty of responsibility leading up the inevitable heartbreaking event that is heavily dependent on performances rather than strong narrative substance. What's meant by the word solid is that this isn't an immaculate film without flaws and deserving of infinite praise because it contains a great deal of manipulative narrative tricks, an overly positive dramatization of its protagonist, and absolutely zero new insight on the societal issues involved or a genuine message to take away beyond its sad and rather plain recreation of actual events. Instead of delving deep into the obvious flaws of Oscar Grant, ranging from an ill temper, relationship cheating, and drug peddling, Coogler sets out to overly forgive these foibles making Grant a martyr instead of a palpable human being representing how no one deserves his tragic fate no matter their past, present, or potential future. However, Fruitvale Station does demonstrate that strong acting performances coupled with a careful execution of technical choices from a new energetic developing talent in Ryan Coogler can make an effective and emotional film. Most of the positives within the film are located in the light dramatic touch of the hand-held camera work, the intimate settings, and the strong acting, especially a star turning performance from Michael B. Jordan who carries the tragic weight of the film on his shoulders. Though Coogler's debut feature might possess an idealized portrayal of his film's subject Oscar Grant as well as some blanketed assumptions on justice there is a great deal of admirable qualities that makes it a dramatically riveting and socially tragic depiction of true events.",2013
9,"Fruitvale Station (2013) was written and directed by Ryan Coogler. Michael B. Jordan plays Oscar Grant III, an African-American man who was shot to death in the Fruitvale BART station on January 1st, 2009. The man who killed him was a police officer. The killer was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served about two years in jail.",2013
1,"This movie is a completely biased ""slice of life"" that is trying to pass itself off as a documentary. It is intended to fan the flames of hatred and rage over a very tragic incident. Why? In the film, Oscar Grant is portrayed as a troubled young man with a heart of gold. I, along with 99.9999% of the other viewers of this movie, have no idea what Oscar Grant was like. But this film was so obviously biased, with so strong of a political agenda, I don't believe one bit of the picture they painted of Oscar Grant. How can I? ",2013
4,"This movie was not about getting to the truth of what happened to Oscar Grant, the film is about creating a sympathetic viewpoint regardless of the ramifications. The producers have every right to do whatever they want if they are making sure we understand the film is complete fiction, which of course they don't and the movie does. ",2013
1,"I wrote one of the first reviews here of this film and it was removed before it became impossible for supporters of Oscar Grant to have such a large number of unbiased but negative reviews taken down simply because they weren't liked. It had nothing to do with the film and was purely a political move. It seems that at the time of my first review there was a movement that this thing get a major award! So I submitted another review that is even more negative than my initial one because I had more time to consider this awful movie. It's simply a totally biased and rather amateurish film that twists facts to fit the political message of those involved in its production. Both badly written and poorly directed, the incidents depicted are presented in ways that are not accurate and unfair to both sides of the issues. That being said, the acting is actually rather passable and those playing significant roles are quite earnest in their work in spite of the stereotypical characterizations in the script. Kevin Durand as the personification of evil, the BART officer involved in the shooting, is an absolute standout. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities and is almost satanic in the film. However, the film has little to say for itself and is a big disappointment. It depends far too much on sensationalism and pure controversy to carry it along rather than presenting an interesting interpretation of a real-life event. Much too preachy and superficial overall and those are tremendous understatements.",2013
4,"It's a true story. It is a semi-tragic event. You already know the ending. I thought there would be some background and character development that would make me truly compassionate and empathetic. Alas, no. Here is a 22-year-old convict with a young child. Not one decision was made in his life with any concept of consequence. He gets his girlfriend pregnant as a teenager. He goes to prison for dealing drugs. He cheats on his girlfriend. He loses his job. All of these events in his life were avoidable. They were CHOICE. So as much as I want to root for him, I find myself not caring. You have to take most of the story with a grain of salt. The story is highlighting the BEST of Oscar Grant, and still the character portrayed is a selfish, irresponsible loser. So when he is killed, regardless of the method in which it occurred, I don't feel a thing. I actually feel that society is better off without him. The acting is solid. The direction is pretty good. The story is simply not uplifting or inspiring.",2013

5,"At a recent screening of 'Fruitvale Station', I asked director Ryan Coogler if he believed the Involuntary Manslaughter conviction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officer who shot Oscar Grant, was justified. Coogler was circumspect, stating that he was just trying to make a movie about what happened but he added that he could understand how Grant's family could have been very much upset with the verdict. An African-American man in the audience commented that that the film did a great service in pointing out the ongoing problem of police brutality in America today; again Coogler was circumspect, acknowledging that his film has engendered a multiplicity of opinions as to the proper verdict for the officer who was charged with Grant's shooting.",2013

7,"Half way through the year and Fruitvale Station is looking to be the indie favourite of the Oscar season and its first hour quite deserves the hype. It begins with the shocking and raw real footage of the event the film documents and leaves the rest of the film on the strong dramatic irony that after these 24 hours all these characters lives will change and none of their plans will come to fruition. With this irony it makes the excellent character study all the more fascinating. Michael B. Jordan is terrific as Oscar Grant, giving a subtle convention-defying performance and he's well supported by Octavia Spencer and Melonie Diaz. I came to feel truly involved with Oscar, especially due to the intimate photography and detailed writing. It's very impressive work from such a young filmmaker who's the same age as the real Oscar Grant.",2013

6,"I have read a lot of reviews and acclaim for this film and when I finally got around to watching it.....it was very underwhelmed. There is so much praise for Michael B. Jordan and Octavia Spencer. These two actors do a great job. I do not think either of them are Oscar-winning, but perhaps Oscar-nominating. Michael B. Jordan's performance is great, but that alone is no reason to see this movie, instead, just watch Chronicle where he is still great (although, compared to Dane DeHann in Chronicle nobody in that movie is a great actor). There is no doubt that this story is tragic. A loss of life is still a loss of life, especially when the incident is an accident, it's just not a very good film.",2013
1,"Talk about revisionist history, this is not what happened. And this is also not the story of Oscar Grant's life. This guy was a menace to society and on this night, he and his friends were rampaging through the BART system menacing the passengers. It is true that Johannes Messerhle was an inept, incompetent police officer who accidentally reached for his firearm instead of his taser, but the way the story is told here is just unjust, deceptive and manipulated to fit the way the producers wanted it to read. I don't think I can ever see another Forrest Whitaker movie or see him the same way ever again. This is disgusting and makes me nauseous.",2014

Gore Verbinski has delivered a film that moves leisurely along peppered with rousing action sequences, comedy, villainy and pathos. It is solid entertainment.

1,"This Disney's Lone Ranger movie is somewhere between a children movie, a bad comedy and a ridiculous, awful western! As a movie, we can see very serious fails - How can you mix a comedy for children with the scene of Butch Cavendish eating Dan Reid's heart??? And Lone Ranger abandoning Tonto??? I played with Lone Ranger toys 35 years ago!!!!! It was part of my dearest childhood memories!!!!! They didn't have the right to transform Lone Ranger and Tonto in such ridiculous characters!!!!!

9,"The early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even had a run at the theatres. The Lone Ranger seemed destined to be a blockbuster stinker. Yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original Lone Ranger purists, and some Western lovers as well, for a rollicking action fun packed time then Gore Verbinski's movie delivers in spades. ",2014
9,"Just got back from seeing it and we were thoroughly entertained. Depp and Hammer were fantastic in their roles and the action was over the top, as expected. Be advised, this film is told from Tonto's point of view based on his recollections of what transpired. This is not an Oscar contender, nor was it ever intended to be, but it is a great popcorn flick. It is violent in certain scenes and may not be suitable for smaller children, but for adults and tweens, it is about right. I did think that the first 10-15 mins or so were a little too slap-sticky for me, but once it gets going, it gets good. To all of the naysayers out there, what did you think you were going to see? It is essentially a western Pirates of the Caribbean, and Depp portrayed his character with the usual humorous persona he always does.",2013
2,"Director Gore Verbinski borrows heavily from his animated Western 'Rango' and some other choice films for his latest mega-budget action adventure, 'The Lone Ranger'. In what seems to be a project greenlit only because Johnny Depp was willing to get into costume and makeup again, this remake is deeply flawed and way too long. Running two-and-a-half hours, the adventure flick could have been loads better with a full hour knocked off its running time.",2015
4,"Entertaining. Has major first and second act trouble. The third act seems to be the movie's strongest part. From what I would read about this movie before it's release, the date kept getting pushed back and pushed back. Also they changed directors, maybe, certainly there were issues the studio had with the movie's tone so I think the movie got more than just one final edit, which is rarely a good sign. I could be wrong on all of that, but what I do know is that what I saw was an uneven movie. Whatever behind the scenes troubles this movie may or may not have had, on the screen I saw a movie that felt very pieced and stitched together rather than some fluid thing. The third act though works, so there you have it, that's the movie, act 1 off act 2 off act 3 works.",2014

Impossible 'stunts'that just wouldn't have happened -The Golden Gate bridge - had not been built yet. It featured Shoddy makeup - wrong tribe. It is No wonder it failed... The radio and TV series were enjoyable and fun for the time period - this movie takes the premise and ruins it. Maybe the current 'electronic thumb generation' will like it - no one else will. Guess the box office (failure)and general disapproval proves it...and lest I forget the 50 star flag shown, the 20+ shot revolvers and the 'Native American' railroad engineer-Expert, the 'flying Silver' and best of all - the 'bad' is all blamed on the ""greedy railroad"" people-a Depp anti US norm...",2014

Well, This is the Lone Ranger movie for the 21st century. It was fantastic. What movie did these critics watch? It set a perfect tone. Depp was terrific. Hammer was pitch perfect - he became grew to be the Lone Ranger. It left me wanting more, and movies rarely do that for me.

So Time Warner offers me two free tickets, I invite a friend and we go and watch this. I was presently surprised after watching this. I remember some of the Lone Ranger comics and remember seeing small clips and my dad telling me stories about it but I never actually saw a show. I enjoyed this movie, it reminded me of fun action with the family. The violence wasn't ridiculous where you couldn't bring children to watch it but authentic enough to know not to try it at home. I saw in an interview that Armie did all the stunts and you can tell. His work on making the character honorable, noble and pretty much a decent human being was very well portrayed. Johnny Depp steals the show with his one liners, a few times I just started laughing at the comments he would make. Overall i'd give this movie an 8/10. Well written, excellent character development, you actually care for them and a great job with the actors and the acting. What I really enjoyed about the movie was that the special effects didn't look too fake. Yeah a few scenes you may have been like yeah right in your head but unlike Fast and the Furious 6, the special effects people on this project do a great job keeping it looking realistic. Bring your family to watch this, a great story of an iconic character. Hopefully this is the start to more because I wouldn't mind watching a sequel or two.",2013

8,"I was a little disappointed about the critics' review of the movie, since I adore Johnny Depp and had been waiting for the movie to release for months. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was lovely. It had action (as promised), a good plot and pretty generous doses of humor for a movie of this genre. Depp stole the show with his portrayal of Tonto, but the other actors were great as well. The obvious comparison of this movie is with the Pirates of the Caribbean series because of Verbinski and Depp. There were parts of the movie, especially those where Tonto's actions generated laughs from the theater, which reminded me of the latter. Both have Depp in eccentric roles which provide ample comic relief. But since the themes are completely different, I feel that a comparison is not exactly fair. All in all, it is a good, lighthearted, entertaining way to spend two and a half hours, and I am considering hitting the theater for it again soon.",2013
7,"Quite frankly, I was highly skeptical on attending the screening of the hugely anticipated Johnny Depp, Arnie Hammer starrer The Lone Ranger, primarily because I am not such a huge fan of western movies plus a runtime clocking almost 150 minutes seemed to long to handle. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try owing to the Depp factor and the director, Gore Verbinsky who has a pretty neat track record as a director.I haven't actually seen The Lone Ranger T.V series which aired from 1949-1957, so I pretty much knew nothing about the characters as such and went in with a clean slate, which in my opinion is a good thing as it removed unwarranted comparisons and biasness.",2013
9,"Once again Disney, Bruckheimer and Depp make for an excellent movie experience. When you watch a television show in black and white growing up, you don't always know what to expect as an adult to see it as a feature length film. I enjoyed this movie tremendously. The storytelling and writing was excellent. The fact that Lone Ranger isn't a ""Disney character"" meant that I had no other reference but the television show to go on. This is one you have to pay attention to. Don't get up in the middle to get a refill on your popcorn because you may very well miss part of the story. Depp plays an older tormented Tonto sharing his experiences meeting the Lone Ranger with a young boy who attends the local carnival. And so the story begins. The element of greed in American history and what it can influence people to do is closely examined throughout the film. Therefore you get entertainment and a lesson and it's cleverly written so that even young adults will get it. No need to explain how dad and granddad use to watch it in black and white back in the day. This is one of the better ""reboots"" of the summer.",2013
8,"I recently attended an early screening for the film at Disney's California Adventure and wow it was great. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a man named John Reid becomes the Lone Ranger who is brilliantly played by Armie Hammer. Johnny Depp obviously stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto; I thought it was one of his best characters he's ever played. The highlight here is the two's chemistry throughout the film, these are two very different people who both have different perspectives on life and they were just hilarious together. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, I thought some characters were a little under developed and not as enjoyable as the leads. I wished the villain were just as enjoyable like how Geoffrey Rush was for Curse of the Black Pearl. So in other terms the film is not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but more superior then the Prate sequels. Go see this movie you'll have a great time, and people can learn from this movie it's got some good messages.",2013

I thought this film was very good -- far better than I had expected from reading all the criticism from the film critics and some of the comments from viewers. Did they just miss the point entirely? Listen, it's not that complicated. This movie just takes the old Lone Ranger classics (radio and TV serial) and has fun with re-booting that story. It's Tonto who is the one telling the story this time and the Lone Ranger who's the straight man -- and this actually works (in my opinion). After all, this is really a re-boot -- a ""how the Lone Ranger became the classic hero"" story -- and having Tonto tell the story is a brilliant move to change the straight-laced Lone Ranger as infallible Western superhero into a believable character for a more modern audience. John Reid, the guy who's eventually going to become the Lone Ranger, starts out as a straight-laced stiff who takes himself and his beliefs far too seriously. Tonto clearly thinks he's pretty useless -- and that's a funny premise to begin with. Armie Hammer is perfectly credible as John Reid -- he's plays fish out of water in the bad old West, but slowly (with Tonto's help) he starts to learn what he needs to learn to be effective in putting a halt to the evil done by the bad guys.",2013
9,"Am a big Johnny Depp fan, but wasn't sure if I would believe him as the character of Tonto. Well, he did a fantastic job and Armie Hammer is not bad to look at either. This was a very entertaining and feel-good movie. My husband liked it as well. Knowing who the Lone Ranger is or having watched him as a child is not pertinent in watching this film. I don't recommend it for small children as there are some bloody moments. In our stress filled lives, we all need an escape and watching this movie made me forget all of my troubles and get lost in this story. I really hope it does well and maybe even have a sequel. I recommend it highly to everyone. Sit back and just be entertained.",2013
5,"The Lone Ranger is nowhere near as terrible as some reviews implied it being but it is also nowhere CLOSE as good as it SHOULD be. This film had the same director from POTC, the same producer from POTC, the same writing duo from POTC, and yes the same exact A-list actor from the POTC franchise. They even kept the same bloody composer for the musical score. Yet this movie is an absolute disappointment as both a western and a blockbuster which I'm sure Disney hoped it'd be. I'll admit that the trailers made this movie look better than I thought it would be. So naturally I was amazed by the bad reviews it got from critics. Are they too harsh? Yes but they're correct in stating it's not a good film. It's not bad either but it is simply mediocre which is in some respects more insulting to viewers curious enough to watch it. The production values look fantastic which is no surprise. This movie cost 215 million dollars and better look like it so it does. The 30 minute climax on two (not one TWO) runaway trains is admittedly among the most flat-out entertaining finales I've seen in a blockbuster. But it takes you two whole hours to get to this point and it's not worth it. The character development is slow to non-existent, the jokes range from slapstick to poop jokes and mostly fall flat. What is so strange about this movie is the massively uneven tone. It has comedy in it but so many dark elements. The violence is even stronger than in POTC and some R-rated movies. There's two brutal massacre scenes of Indians and a part where someone's heart is ripped out and eaten. This is a Disney film meant for families with kids? And the acting is not much to keep your interest. Johnny Depp is channeling Jack Sparrow AGAIN and poor Armie Hammer is given a poorly written protagonist that's a bumbling fool. So this is what 215 million dollars is spent at Disney these days? I'm not impressed.",2015
10,"This series has the quality and intensely personal nature as ""The Killing"" and ""Breaking Bad"", but so far, without the violence. ",2013
10,"I discovered this on Netflix and knew nothing about it when I began watching it. It is a brilliant piece of television. The story is gripping and this caliber of work is very rare. The writing is the best you'll find and the cast is powerful. This is not a chest thumping, triumphant, primal scream of a story. This is a walk through fear, uncertainty, and madness, that is at times almost too painful to watch. But you will watch it. ",2014
10,"Well, after the first episode of watching Aden Young embody the character of Daniel Holden, I'm hooked. Daniel Holden was arrested for the rape and murder of his girlfriend at the age of 16, convicted and sent to live on death row at the age of 18, and 20 years later after living on death row in a cell by himself, preparing himself to die and be forever gone from this earth, has survived 5 stays of execution long enough for technology to catch up with forensic science and, unbelievably, Daniel Holden is released to his family because it is determined that his DNA was not found at the scene of the crime. So now the big question is: Will the current prosecutor re-try a 20 year old case? The whole town has an opinion, and while Daniel Holden walks around like a man in his own dream, quietly and painfully processing freedom, relating to a family that is 20 years older, and adjusting to the overwhelming overload of his sensory perceptions, danger is lurking as those involved in the original case begin to realize what is at risk if a new trial takes place. It's too soon for all of us, the audience, to know what is at risk because, wisely, the story is unfolding slowly and painstakingly like a new flower. The actors are all superb as they falter and try to think of how to talk to Daniel. Daniel is unsure, awkward, and quiet...very, very quiet. Aden Young's face can show about 5 emotions all at the same time, and in one scene as he is describing in a perfect soft, southern drawl his prison ""initiation"" experience for his shallow step-brother, Teddy, Daniel's expression changed from placid, to subdued, to quietly earnest, to a moment of sheer madness, before he snapped back to placid, leaving Teddy speechless and a little bit afraid. Totally alone and silent, this tall man with the haunted eyes drew me in as he walked to a baseball field and just laid down in the grass. How can such a gentle person be guilty of such a heinous crime? Who committed this crime and let this sweet soul suffer 24/7 for 20 years waiting to die, stealing his youth? Is this man guilty, innocent, reformed, or just a stone cold killer with a good con going? I don't know yet. So I will stay tuned.",2013
10,This is a review for the first 3 episodes of Rectify.,2013
10,In recent times TV channels have been spewing out shows after shows but without any class. Sundance has come up with Rectify which defies all the current trends. Rectify is not a show which is recommended for people who like fast paced storyline and actions. Rectify has a slow narration. It allows room for the characters to feel the feelings and act without saying words. The direction is beautiful. you almost feel like its a work of art. The background music is the life of the show. It has been beautifully crafted to capture and express every emotion the lead is feeling. Some of the dialogues feel straight out of a novel. Rectify is TV at its best. I am really glad to have taken the time out to watch the entire first season. I hope the second season doesn't commercialize and dilute the offering of the show.,2013
10,"This, whilst produced by the same people who produced Breaking Bad, doesn't have tense, action and the characters aren't under constant threat. Rectify is more of a character-study than a deep narrative, there isn't a giant mystery or conflict it strives to describe a much more personal experience of the protagonist, and does so wonderfully. It is about how one man deals with life outside of prison walls after serving 19 years within them, he is released with no smooth transition and is literally thrown into a world he doesn't understand. Rectify is about a man who has been left stuck in the past when the world has changed so much without him. The production values, writing and cinematography are all on par with Breaking Bad's extremely high standards.",2013
10,"While Sundance Festival may discover fragile intelligent independent movies, it also sometimes expose badly filmed,casted and written cheap ones. So I was curious to see what Mr Redford channel would offer for its first series. The first scene gave me an early hint,it is magnificent, this man in the check out room, in between the world he knows, obscure and the frightening sunny world outside, limited dialog. This series will be cinematic, base on directing more than scenario ( a good one though). This is not a judiciary story but the story of a man, mysterious, profoundly changed by its jailed time, who was still teenage when the movie of its life took a brutal stop. It add to the subtlety to ignore whether he did it or not and his silence about it. The dysfunctional recomposed family is source of lot of deep moment. Few examples : When Ted junior asks his wife to get naked, the humiliation he impose her, like an object. Then, when he is about to leave for a seminar, she turn on the hairdryer and next image, we see what we guess, her hair are already dry,she just doesn't want to listen to him. Ted, the villain so far, manipulative with his stepmother but way too idiot to manipulate Daniel (golf scene). I stop here,so many great moments in this show. The atmosphere,idiosyncratic a bit remind me of the cult Twin Peaks, the country people, closed community who buries their secrets. The quality of the dialog remind me of Six feet under. This is really the type of series I love and so far, along with House of cards, my favorite this season",2013
10,I'm in awe to how the acting quality of highest rank is delivered in this beautifully captured story of a town who has been witnessing a horrible crime some 20 years ago. ,2017

9,Greetings from Lithuania.,2017
9,This show quite honestly surprised me. I don't normally expect slow-paced dramas to keep me entertained. But the performances were deeply gripping. The story is developing at a slower pace with lots of room for establishing the characters and their interactions both for the Holden family and their community.,2016
10,Absolutely loved everything about the show it is right up my ally i am very interested in psychology and the justice system and have a great understanding of it. It's nice to finally have something out there that people can see and understand what people go through when they come out and how it affects them and how they are treated how it takes away their humanity i like the prison flash backs and how it shows what he went through to connect to why he is acting a certain way or feeling a certain way. It's accuracy is bang on his thoughts feelings actions etc. I highly recommend this show and i will most definitely be passing it on to family in friends i hope this show gets picked up i will be watching for sure. I enjoy all the characters they are all played very well and with no particular familiar faces which i think is nice too. I think people could learn a lot from this show and how people view these situations. Criminal or not these people are human and nobody should have that stripped away. Everyone makes mistakes and we are all struggling to understand ourselves and find ourselves and who we are. I think it is very relate able even for someone who hasn't been in this situation just to be misunderstood in general. Love love love this show!,2013
10,"While the premise and synopsis of the show hint onto crime/docudrama/true crime thing, that's only a really small part of it. If I had to define Rectify with one word or trait, it would be it's humanity. It's a four season long dissection of a human condition, sometimes dour, sometimes magical.",2016
10,I wish this show had more of a following. I will be sad to see it go. For me it comes in at a very close 2nd to Breaking Bad. It's by far some of the best acting I have ever seen on the TV series. Aden Young's performance is outstanding. You get caught up in all the characters because they are all acted so well. If you have not watched this show then you are certainly missing out. I would highly recommend you get on the band wagon immediately because you're going to want to talk about it before it's gone. There is not really any action sequences or any blood and guts to speak of but it's not dull at all. If it's a serious drama that you are into than you will not be disappointed.,2016
10,"We love this new series. Unfortunately, we came across it as it was first coming out, so had to wait for each new show, suffer through commercials and then wait for the next season. However, it soon showed up on Netflix (yay) and we'll probably just wait from now on until each new season is added there to spare ourselves the television-channel-torture.",2016

HBO, AMC, FX, PBS, BBC and Showcase have all contributed to this renaissance in the medium. From Six Feet Under to Mad Men to Downton Abbey and Justified, modern audiences have been truly gifted with great things to discuss at our dinner tables, at the office or around the back deck or porch. Perhaps it is a reaction to the gluttonous and inane presence of reality television that has helped sparked this talent for great script writing or perhaps it was inevitable. Who knows.",2013
10,"Wow... when I first noticed Rectify on Netflix I didn't expect too much from it. It wasn't the premise, but the 5 star rating that made me give it a shot. Boy was I in for a surprise...",2016
10,"I cant say enough about this show and the surprise of how it captivates me (and my wife) as new (2017) fans. I did a Google search on what to watch on Netflix and it was listed as the ""best series that no one is watching"" I totally agree. So glad I found it and only on the beginning of Season 2. Why isn't Netflix promoting this show more?? Great subtle acting by ""Daniel"" and yes, I get how tough critics may say it may move a bit too slow... but as some other reviewer pointed out, it just allows the viewer to get to know the characters much more intimately. I am in love with Amantha and the tenderness of many other the character interactions is some of the best I have ever seen on any TV drama. 10 stars all the way!",2017
10,"Just binge watched all 30 episodes of this great series and can't believe how few people I know have ever even heard of it. This was excellent TV. The acting was some of the best I've ever come across in a series. The writing, my god, what a story. The show is a real character study. If your looking for gratuitous sex and violence, watch sons of anarchy, this show isn't for you. If you're looking for a real character driven drama,that makes you really think and feel real emotions this is the show for you. It's the closest thing to reading a book I've ever encountered on the screen. No dialogue is wasted, and often times it's what the characters aren't saying. The awkward silences that say more than the actual spoken words. The cinematography is excellent as well, each episode filled with great shot after great shot. The casting was phenomenal, set in the south I didn't catch a hint of a phony or overstated southern accent, I wouldn't be surprised if most of the cast really is from the south. Highly recommend this smart watch to anyone that likes a good story.",2016

9,"...Locke provides irrefutable proof that he is. Tom Hardy is absolutely captivating in this role, and he has to be. It's all about his character Ivan Locke driving in a car. That's the setting. All forms of dialogue are from Locke and from calls he gets ingoing and outgoing through the car. The weird thing is, you don't even notice it after a while. Everything flows so smoothly and Tom Hardy's performance completely captures everything you'd expect from this character as he's experiencing these dilemmas - you believe every word out of his mouth and every subtle nuance in his expressions. Tom Hardy owns this movie and Locke really is the perfect vehicle (literally) for showing off his barebones acting chops.",2015

7,"Apart from about 20 seconds at the start, the entire film is shot in the confined space of a BMW drivers seat. There is only one physical actor & about 4 different camera shots. Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, he lives a successful life in Construction & is a dedicated family man. He is calm and collected and gives the impression that he is a man all about control. In the time it takes him to drive from Birmingham to London, his whole life changes, and you get to see how and why through various telephone calls on Bluetooth loudspeaker. ",2015

8,"I can only say we have to appreciate such work of arts since in the modern era of over-exploitation money took over all the popularity of the cinema. It is very obvious that the movie depends on a very limited budget, which I like the most when it comes to cinema, because it is not just for entertainment, or it is not all about marketing and sales. Apart from the story, the movie conveys a message that stimulating people's minds and imaginations does not necessarily require cutting- edge visual effects or a science-fiction rooted story. There are many ways to do that, and when you see the movie I assure you you will ask yourself ""How on earth did they manage to craft such an extraordinary movie with such a straightforward story?"".This movie has a pure and creative story flow which keeps you follow with all the focus. It makes you imagine, stimulates your curiosity and plays with your nerves. Better watch it yourself!",2016
7,"Both in terms of technique and storytelling approach Locke proves to be a fascinating piece of filmmaking, as the audience accompanies a successful construction manager on a thrilling car journey, where he faces a massive, life-changing predicament, one that effects both his professional and private life. Tom Hardy is simply magnificent in the title role, portraying a highly complex character for whom one develops very mixed emotions, as he is respected and despised both at the same time. The film demonstrates great ingenuity and creativity with its concept, proving gripping and incredibly suspenseful throughout, the credit for the which can be equally shared by Hardy's marvelous acting skills and a captivating story that is flawlessly executed. The fact that a fairly simple film with a single actor, a single confined location and a long string of problems can produce such a spellbinding experience is nothing short of extraordinary, which certainly makes Locke worthy of the highest praise.",2014

10,"This movie is formed by the excellent Tom Hardy performance. It's that good. I would put it up there with Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mocking Bird, and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Okay, now I think you understand how good I think Hardy does. The movie seems boring from a simple summary. ""It's about a guy taking phone calls in his car for almost 90 minutes"". That sounds boring, but it's not. It's actually the most suspenseful movie of the year. (2014, it came out in the US in 2014). Sounds impossible, but writer/director Steven Knight does amazing with a tiny budget. You also get to know, not only Hardy's character, but the people he's talking to on the phone as well. They truly seem like real people. The situation they create is also very creative and interesting. I won't say what it is, but I don't think it's a spoiler. I'll just say it makes you wonder what you'd do in the given situation. It's the best British film I've seen since Trainspotting, and definitely deserves one, if not more, viewings.",2015

8,"It is extremely hard to make a movie based in one location. Further more, it is even more difficult to create a movie with only one actor present on the screen and it is extraordinary if the film is made in real time, meaning from the moment the film begins till the end of the final credits we are observing a melt down of one individual who lets us understand what is happening in his life only with the phone calls he makes in his car. In a nutshell this is what ""LOCKE"" a film by Steven Knight is all about. ",2014
10,"I was lucky enough to catch an early screening of this before it officially hits the States theatrically and I must say, this was quite possibly one of the best films I've seen in the last 5 years. Locke pits Tom Hardy as titular character going through a life crisis in real time while taking a drive into the London nightlife. Locke features Tom Hardy in, what quite possibly may be, the best performance from an actor that I've seen in quite some time. The film does very little in giving the audience much eye candy, considering the entire film takes place in Locke's car as he drives through the night. What this film does, which not many films do anymore, it relies solely on Hardy's brawny shoulders. With very little in terms of a pay off regarding plot, Hardy's tour de force performance engrosses you with every minute that goes by. There was not one moment I can think of where I was looking at my watch or was at all bored with it. To think that an entire film taking place in a singular location, let alone it being entirely in a car, would be heart pounding even had me a little skeptical. Fear not, Locke will have you gripping the handles of your seat and will have you talking about it even after the end credits roll. Many people will most likely dislike the abrupt and ambiguous ending but at the end of the day there was no other way to end this night from hell for this man. Steven Knight writes and directs a taut, white knuckle thriller here that deserves to be seen by the masses. I still can't get over how great this film was, so much so that when it officially comes to theaters, I'll be racing back to see it again. Overall, this is minimalist filmmaking with a one two punch for a lead performance. If you're fans of Eastern Promises and Dirty Little Things, you will love Steven Knight's Locke. And even if you are not fans of those films, the film is worth seeing for Tom Hardy's performance alone. I highly recommend this film.",2014
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies that take place in a confined space are outright thrillers that usually take full advantage of helpless feelings and desperate actions.

This entry from the Dallas International Film Festival takes a much different approach.",2014

He drives and through series of phone conversations his life alters forever. Sounds simple but it certainly isn't.

You might throw some transitions shots now and then or get crafty with the editing but not much more. The acting, though, is crucial as the number of characters is limited, but no actor could lift a poor script in these conditions. This kind of films are all about screen writing. Limiting the characters freedom of movement to the extreme while keeping the action thrilling, the tension growing and the characters engaging is definitely a risky experiment, but for that same reason, appealing, tempting and worth giving it a shot.",2015

I had the privilege of seeing this movie at a festival, along with another British indie (the Apostate - more on that in another review) and was amazed at how a film that takes place in a car, while a man speaks on the phone, could keep my interest for 80+ minutes. But it can. And it does. Locke, played brilliantly by Tom Hardy, is a Welsh man who works as a manager of some sort on a building site - after work one night, he climbs into his car and drives south, heading for London. Along the way, he makes and receives a number of phone-calls that turn his life 'upside-down'. Everything from personal and relationship issues, to work issues. The action never moves from the car. In honesty, the issues he deals with are important in HIS world, but there isn't a shock or a twist ending. They are his issues and we take a moment in his life and live it through him. Don't look for your 'three act' structure or your special FX. This is one man, a car and a phone. And it's great.",2015

It's a shame because the plot is based off of the real life gangster Mickey Cohen who was the ruler of LA for a time, and the source material has endless potential.

4,"When it stays light and adventurous, ""Gangster Squad"" has its minutes of spirited entertainment. But too often it attempts to mimic other films while pulling back the reigns of exuberance for a much darker approach. Zigzagging between callous seriousness one minute to comical zaniness the next, the film offers a mishmash of tones, styles, and gangster movie clichés. Consistency is not its strong point. By the third time slow-motion shootouts and glamorous dames awash in billowing cigarette smoke give way to tedious villains and brooding montages, any sense of direction vanishes - along with the fun.",2013
4,"Though made for a plethora of reasons, a film need only achieve one goal to be successful: it needs to be entertaining. Engaging characters, good performances, and a story that is engrossing, even if a bit cardboard or cliché. When a film ultimately fails, it is because its characters are wooden or stereotypical, the storyline is boring, and the only question it might raise is, ""was this intended to be sleep therapy for a study on insomnia?"" Set that film in 1949 and make it about gangsters and cops, and you've got Gangster Squad, a film so inept that Ruben Fleischer should win an award for managing to make a violent action movie that could put an Olympic sprinter to sleep in mid-stride.",2013
5,"I love Ryan Gosling. I love Zombieland. I think Micheal Pena is one of the most underrated actors working right now. I don't know what happened. No Wait Yeah I do this is one of the laziest most sterile scripts that I've witnessed in recent memory. This feels like a studio executive went up to a script generator and typed in ""Undercover cop movie"" and it printed out the Expendables but with cops . Then he read it and put in "" Undercover Cover Cop movie set in classic Hollywood"". ",2013

9,"This movie has everything you could ask for, in an action-packed emotional thrill ride, provided that you are able to just let go, and let yourself to be engrossed. For those who prefer films that may have a little less predictability, or people that find themselves unable to maintain the ""suspension of disbelief"", this movie would be understandably less enjoyable.",2013
5,Well I got back last night after watching it. It was a last minute thing too. Love Gangster movies and thought this looked great. loving Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed public enemy number one (suprisingly) so I was a little dismayed by the total lack of empathy with this movie upon leaving the cinema. It was running good right up to Brolins wife (excellent acting btw) began to help him hire the team of misfits. From there it pretty much fell away. the crew were average at best. The acting was strained. Brolin wasn't too bad. But even he was below average. Never looked too comfortable. I couldn't really put a finger on it but it never really got my blood pumping. A few plot holes I cant be bothered to go into and I wonder if this was the outcome of a total script re-write by the director. Who knows. Penn tried his best to give the movie some depth. But even his performance lacked the Scorsese touch. Jimmy the Gent he wasn't. Despite the obvious attempt. Average movie that could have been good. Never great.,2013
1,"It's predictable, in that it's exceedingly formulaic, and laden with plot devices that are way overused for any genre. Drawing and quartering (halving, in this case) a man with two cars (in the opening scene) certainly could be considered one way to set the tone, however, after the first five dark, and rather grueling minutes, it quickly devolves to a sentimental buddy/action romp, and becomes impossible to be taken seriously. Even the cool noir-speak is abandoned once the action sets in. Once the plot starts rolling along, characters stop saying neat things like: ""Who's the tomato?"" (In reference to Emma Stone). Thoroughly disappointing. Sadly, Penn's performance falls spectacularly flat. Too much makeup, not enough emotion.",2013

Well guess what, the wait wasn't worth it, in fact maybe the wait should of been longer. I for one just don't get it, why would such quality actors and actresses sign onto this trite? Did I hate this movie? NO! Did I like this movie? NO! This is simply a waste of time, the movie lacks drama, authenticity, suspense, and realism. There is plenty of blood and guts, but no substance for the viewers.

10,"Another great show that NBC will probably cancel for some idiotic reality show. Because it is filmed in Prague and Paris (not Vancouver for a change), the scenery is beautiful and refreshing for us Americans. The acting is top-notch (Fitchner and Sutherland are great), with some interesting back stories already introduced after only two episodes. The story is fast-paced and has smart dialog. The whole concept of ""Crossing Lines"" opens so many doors...cases they can pursue throughout the numerous locales of Europe. The actors have good chemistry, which is a refreshing change from so much of the junk they try to pass as ""TV"" today. Some of the negative comments on here are pure drivel...from the same types who help keep Survivor and Big Brother on the air. If you like this show, please help keep it on the air by writing a positive review to counter the clueless morons who are always contributing to great shows getting canceled.",2013

10,"I love this show and all actors are of highest caliber! I find it more interesting because we don't see the same backgrounds and a lot of it is not familiar. I really hope this show does not get cut. Please watch it and give it a try. I really like the actor William Fichtner, I have enjoyed his acting in past movies and he certainly deserves the starring role that he has now. The other actors are new to me but they are equally compelling. I have to say though that Mr Fichtner is a standout for me. I hate that I have to write so many lines because I'm not good at creative writing. So this will probably be the last one I do.",2013
10,"Excellent show with an international feel, intelligent scripting and great cast. Feels like criminal minds with a European flair. I've read the negative reviews about the accuracy of the International Criminal Court which I think takes away from focus of the show. I don't think people are particularly interested in whether certain elements are true facts or not. It's fictional and we know it. I believe that with better marketing, the viewership can increase and be as successful as, say, criminal minds. Have some faith NBC!!! I'd hate to lose such a great show that has a lot to offer... A lot of potential indeed. Kudos again for unearthing such marvelous cast members.",2013
8,"This is one show worth watching in my opinion and I am surprised at the negative reviews that are rubbishing it. It is obviously not technical enough for those reviewers. I find William Fichtner character very likable and I also like the way he goes about his work. He is a really good detective who thinks outside the box. Nothing seems to get in his way and even if it is a bit unbelievable that he gets to solve every crime in record time, it is still entertaining. The supporting cast is also excellent,i For this show to be successful, I do believe it will need to take on more interesting dark themes or it runs the risk of becoming a run-of-the-mill forensics series like Law and Order or Kojack...no knock on these shows.....",2013
7,"Crossing Lines is a smartly written, cleverly acted and well produced drama about an international crime fighting unit that investigates multi-national (hence the name: Crossing the ""boundary"" lines of EC countries) high end and highly sophisticated crimes.

6,"The first episode draws you in very well. Some of the cast are very good actors, but some are very bad and when these bad actors are ""acting"" It feels like listening to nails scratching a wall. Sutherland and the Ameircan guy are good. The leader of the team is a very bad actor. His dialogue delivery is ridiculously bad imo. The script seems contrived in many instances. The scriptwriter has this bad habit of injecting ""romantic"" interludes between the characters in very serious situations, where no sane person would be ""hitting"" on anyone. For Pete's sakes, in the first story, one of their co-worker Annamarie has been kidnapped and is in the process of being killed by a mad man, when the Irish guy and the woman who dies are are hitting on each other in the park instead of being focused on finding Annamarie. Just stupid. But I still kinda like the show. So watch it and enjoy it for what it is..just a made up TV show!",2014

I always love Donald Sutherland and hope that his presence in the series can be increased. I was a bit disappointed at hearing everything in English. As an American living in Europe I hear different languages all the time. However, for example, when a German person speaks with a German person, they do not speak in English. I know that Americans are not accustomed to reading sub-titles, but I would give this series a 10 if this had happened. It's an NBC production. Perhaps if it were a cable production, the extra time and expense for subtitling and speaking in like languages would have been permitted. Still, I love the show. Hoping for more of the same.",2013

1,If someone has not seen all 3 seasons then this is a spoiler. The GREAT cast from Seasons 1 and 2 are ALL gone but 2. It is NOT the same show anymore. They should have started a new show NOT changed the one we where watch. I HATE it now. I wish they would bring back the cast that are still alive and go back to work the way it was. Season 3 SUCKS. I LOVED season one. LOVED season 2 even more. So was looking forward to season 3. BUT DEAR GOD it is gone. Nothing is the same. NOT the same show at all.,2016
4,"Watched the first three episodes and the initial story line was interesting, but the interaction between characters was awful. No police officer in his or her right mind would be goo goo eyeing each other while hunting an armed and dangerous serial killer and allow the killer to get close up and stab one! The characters are poorly developed lacking incredibility. I hoped the show would get better , but it didn't The actors are to glam for the parts of police officer, running around in high heels, tight jeans and revealing tops just what every police officer wears to run down a criminal not. Too bad the premise is a good one and had potential! Waste of time.",2015
7,Crossing lines brings an international flavor to the TV Crime Scene. It provides not only the chase and capture for the viewer but also provides enough suspense to require the viewer to also think! This the type of crime show that many of the U.S. do not offer and for those whom really like mysteries find when viewing British TV. While it does misinform those with a lack of knowledge about the workings of the International Court the fictional group does its job showing that crime is an multi national problem. A more feasible scenario would be that the fictional group is a part of Interpol. I give it rating of 7 based on the following: Good Imaginative writing. Good Acting. Good Photography. Enough Action without becoming boring.,2013

The next episode - season 3 - EVERYONE except two cast members are gone! Replaced or killed off. WHat ????? No wonder it didn't make it past season 3. Viewers invested all this time in these characters, and just like that, almost all are written off. I'm now watching season 3, and I could care less about this show. I doubt I will make it past the first episode. I would have rated this show 8/10 stars, but I am so irked about the regime change, that I'm giving it 1 star, for wasting my time.",2017

I don't know why people are complaining about this show so much. It's your average summer show - entertaining without having to be too thought-provoking. I will admit that sometimes I don't know how they got certain places or things, but that could be because NBC does cut about 8 minutes of footage each episode. Why? who knows. But the acting is pretty good, even for fairly unknown actors, the story lines are fairly interesting, and it has the action to keep you hooked. I'm sincerely hoping for a season two!!",2013
5,"But...they chose to mention the International Criminal Court (ICC) , even supposedly visit the headquarters at the Hague....and they are supposed to be acting on behalf of the ICC while investigating the murders. This is based in absolutely no research. Whoever recommended including the ICC in the plot should be fired. ICC investigates the worst crimes committed against humanity, like genocide, crimes of war and crimes against humanity. They do not investigate or pursue serial killers or anything like that. The judges cannot sign any kind of Court Orders authorizing the investigation or capture of criminal, since only the Court can issue an arrest warrant to be executed by governments.In the pilot they even mention the crime of aggression as equivalent to random abduction and murder.It is so absurd, and it can even hurt the image of the Court internationally. Bummer since everything else is well accomplished,but this ICC issue is really a big glitch.",2013

Maybe someone wanted to give that organization some positive PR, but the premise never rings true, and makes for lousy television. In keeping with the formula, each of the cops has a ""skill"" and an ""issue"". Problem is each of them is so overwrought melodramatic, that none of the characters is believable, except Sutherland's officer of the court. Heavy with their issues and a suitably evil but utterly trite villain, they are a crushingly humorless bunch. No fun at all.",2013

1,"When I first saw the commercials for this show, I thought, ""Oh, hey, they're remaking one of my favorite childhood shows, I hope it'll be good."" But I was severely disappointed, and insulted. Teen Titans was the perfect blend of comedy and drama. But this show takes everything you loved from the original, sets it on fire, extinguishes the flames with it's urine, and claims that its your new favorite show. I wouldn't care so much if they didn't insult the people who enjoy, what was, a pretty awesome show. If they did their own thing and ignored what everyone else thought, I wouldn't care. But since they flipped the bird at the people who criticized them, and say that its everyone's favorite show, that's where I get furious. I heard that the creators of the show never saw a single episode of the first Teen Titans, and, by God, I can believe that. If you want your Teen Titans fix, go watch the original show. And bring the kids who keep Teen Titans GO! going, so they can see how awesome the original show is, and how childish this new show is.",2015
1,"The popularity of Toddler Titans is questionable to me.I don't find it funny and most of the morals and jokes are incredibly stupid and rage-inducing. For example,take an episode like ""Knowledge."" The moral it teaches is ""If you're smart,you will be a huge bummer and no one will like you,but if you're an idiot and brain dead,everyone will be friends with you."" Now if that's not offensive,I don't know what else from this show is. If the show wants to be funny,that's fine,but they need to at least TRY to be funny,and the sad thing is that the creators know this show is stupid! No,seriously. Another thing that bothers me about this show is the creators' response to the criticism it gets.For example,in ""Dreams"",they literally DUBBED OVER A SCENE FROM TROUBLE IN TOKYO. It's like they're trying to say ""Hey!If you don't like this show,screw you!We ruined your PRECIOUS SHOW. And screw you again!"" Another example of this is actually an entire episode where the titans become serious and make fun of the older show even though the older show had funny moments. Another big screw you to older fans!",2015
1,"As a devoted fan of the 2003 Teen Titans series, I was ecstatic upon hearing about Teen Titans Go!. While I knew from the get-go that it was going to be mainly a comedy show, this was fine since the original series tended to be more comedic than action-packed anyway. Also, I found the Teen Titans shorts that were made for the DC Nation block to be highly amusing and assumed that this series would be similar to those. ",2013
1,"Teen Titans Go! is an appalling insult to cartoon shows in general. The animations are too colorful for my liking, as well as the terrible lessons the show teaches, such as these: Rain is the tears of clouds, John Milks Booth and Abe ""Turkey Sandwich"" Lincoln built a house in the woods, Bees are a valid form of currency, pyramid schemes involve mummies, Pranks are funny, even when it gets your friends killed, farmers steal time during daylight savings, and many many more. As well, its characters are one dimensional and insane. Robin goes crazy over a SANDWICH. Cyborg always screams out BOOYAH!. Starfire and Beast Boy are childish and stupid, and Raven is depressed. The characters bully each other, and Beast Boy dismembers himself to look manly. This show needs to be revamped, or taken off of the air entirely.",2017
1,"The Teen Titans GO! program promotes bullying. Simple as that. How, you ask? Because Robin, who is poorly portrayed (like every character in this show) is ganged up on this show, because it appears that whoever gives the ideas for these shows apparently has run out of ideas and now has turned desperately to crude humor and bullying. All of the Titans, and some of the villains, make fun of Robin and try to ruin his life. This show is so much different from the original show, and the ""Easter eggs"" that the show gives do not even come close to making up for the poor animation, lack of quality, bullying, and crude humor. The whole show feels mass produced and the difference in quality is shocking. Putting this show on the air further past this point would mean they would start taking ideas from the beginning of the show or other shows. As for the bullying, the characters are so mean to each other and chose willingly to ruin Robin's life in the recent episode ""Permanent Record"" I am disgusted.

Immature humor can work, it worked for the original show, but they screwed it up here!!!! And my final point, the creators haven't even watched the original show.

It was an excellent show that appealed to everyone of all ages and is highly regarded as one of the best shows of all time. The characters were complex and lovable, the story arcs were interesting to watch and see how they unfurl, and it balanced the show with comedy aspects and action aspects. After the disappointing series finale that was Things Change, fans like me wanted a continuation because it left the door open for another season. Well Stuart Snyder and the rest of CN decide to once again give us fans the middle finger and decide to produce this abomination known as Teen Titans Go! Teen Titans Go! is a take on the original Teen Titans show that continues to follow the lives of the Titans we've come to know and love.

The animation quality has greatly decreased, with the characters being both shorter, and look almost nothing like the original ones. While the first episodes may have been okay, and every once in a while we will say another okay episode, the show still has many terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE episodes. For example, one episode took the third episode of the original teen titans show, and just dubbed the voice actors reading new lines and ""jokes"" over the characters. Which is extremely lazy on the animators part. And for everyone who says that ""oh, this is a kids show, it isn't meant for you!"", the lessons that a kid could interpret from the show are terrible.

Now, let's get down to the root of the show. Teen Titans Go! is a show about 5 (or let's say 4, since Robin has no powers, all though he, for some reason tried to gain them.) teens, or in everyone's opinions toddlers, who are sorry excuses for heroes that attempt to fight crime but at the end of the day fail miserably. And half of the time they do nothing but sit around all day. The main complexity of the show is basically nothing. The only real consistency is the fact that Robin is head over heels for Starfire to the point where it's just stalking. The animation is poor and the only goo episode is 40...40...20%. And why is in every episode they attempt to murder each other? It's giving the wrong message to young impressionable children. Now on to the characters: Robin: Control Freak all the way. It's as if they were putting together some quick, crappily animated project and made the personalities way different. Because that is NO classic Robin, it's just a sorry excuse for him. Sure he had his moments but still! Starfire: Does she really not know that everything does not start with the and her ""tameranean"" or however the heck you spell it words are not eligible in the English dictionary?

1,"This new teen titans was designed for toddlers. I understand that but it was done at a terrible price to an already great title. They don't even fight crime, they just screw around in the tower all day making them an absolute joke. There's no story development to follow just stupid terrible jokes. I grew watching the original and not only did it have good values to learn from but an action packed story line. This new one is just one bad joke after another, no suspense, no real moral to learn, just childish. It seems to have just sold out to fill air time and it's piggy baking on the credit and reputation of the original series.",2015
1,"I heard that there would be a new Teen Titans show coming out, and I was like, ""Hey, the original was such a great show, maybe I should check this out."" I didn't watch it once it premiered, but I was pretty skeptical of how it would turn out. Before I even bothered watching it, it didn't look very promising because the design was low quality. I watched it for the first time while I was babysitting, and I wanted to throw the remote at the TV. It's very awful and forgettable and the characters are unlikeable and annoying. Like in that one episode when Beast Boy and Cyborg said nothing but ""waffles"" throughout an entire 15 minute episode, which irritated me, but about every episode is this way. And I would like to add that the jokes aren't funny, and I read in other reviews that Raven is a brony. (I don't like MLP and it drives me crazy to see it EVERYWHERE.) .....Of course. I think I lost some of my brain cells from being forced to watch this show for 2 hours back to back with Gumball when I babysat yesterday, and I'll probably have to watch it again the next time.",2014
1,"It's insulting to watch, really. The original Teen Titans was a masterpiece filled with a perfect blend of comedy and drama. Go! is just so obviously a cash-grab, banking on the success of the original. The humor is awful and childish, and the animation style looks just as bad. I honestly thought it was a fan-made series at first! The shows only staying point is that it has the same voice actors from the original show. That was the only thing that convinced me it wasn't just some fan-made flash animation. I'm not saying dramatic shows can't have an exclusively funny season. A great example of this is Full Metal Panic. This show had a dramatic season one, HILARIOUS season two, and dramatic season three. What made the show so amazing was that it kept ALL of the character traits intact AND the original art style. Season two was comedic because that's how the show was when there were no villains to fight. Teen Titans Go! could have been something really great if they didn't ret-con EVERYTHING and kept the characters and art style intact. It could have been a really funny series about just the Titans daily lives, now that all the super villains are gone. Instead, we got a juvenile, flash animation-looking cartoon.",2014
1,"If you never saw the original Teen Titans, will likely find this review useless, but who saw the original you know what I'm talking about ",2013
10,"Most of the negative reviews of this are complaining how it's horrible and the original Teen Titans was better. The thing is the only things the two shows have in common are Characters that's it. This show is not trying to pick up were the original Teen Titans left off. Teen Titans Go! is a parody of the original show. Like a Robot Chicken Short It's a show that is just fun. No super major story arcs . Just fun. Fanboys and and Fangirls need to get over themselves. The animation style is completely different. I never expected this show to be a continuation. I love the raven episode. IMHO Starlfie the Terrible , Legs, Shades of Raven, Caged Tiger, Meatball Party and Girls Night Out are hilarious. sit back and don't take yourself seriously and enjoy",2014
9,"Let's get one thing straight from the beginning: Teen Titans GO! is not a reboot of the older and more mature TV show of the early 2000's. Instead, TTG is a very entertaining mixture of usual superhero romp (with the gratuitous violence) and self-deprecating humor, with characters that represent several human foibles, especially when it comes to how Robin is portrayed: as the power-mad leader of the Titans who is capricious, eccentric, jealous, paranoid and spoiled rotten. Most of the humor is the type of pie-in-the-face you find in cartoons like Spongebob, but there are also plenty of jokes for us adults, especially for those of us who grew up in the 80s. I also perceive a libertarian streak in some of the writing; for instance the episode ""Nose Mouth"" clearly shows the dangers of abusing a great power (Raven's black magic) to fix apparent minor personality flaws in some of the team members, with things getting out of hand the moment Raven started to see problems to 'fix' around her which turns her into an evil entity quite rapidly. That has to be one of the best analogies about government abuse of power I have seen on a TV show. ",2015
10,"I am probably and arguably one of the biggest fans of teen titans. I enjoyed young justice very much probably because it brought back quite a few of the historical titans members. when titans go was announced and the previews came flooding in, i was disgusted. I didn't want this!! i wanted my old titans back and i wanted them to continue on from season 6 or start over with a new, even better incarnation of the original animated series. needless to say like everyone else i didn't give the show a snowball's chance in hell and flipped the channel whenever it started. ",2013
8,Teen Titans Go! is a reaction to all those dark and gritty reboots coming up in the superhero genre.,2015
3,"I TRIED to like it, but I just can't. I tried looking past the Art style that is reminiscent of a parody from MAD. It has the original Teen Titans Voice Actors, so on that camp the show is good. The plot... well, it feels more like a web comic or a MAD sketch than Teen Titans. I know the 2003 series had a few ""silly"" episodes, but THOSE are way serious than anything from this series.",2013
8,"Sometimes it feels like Woody Allen is deliberately hit and miss. Every other film appears to be a winner so it's become easy to just skip the mediocre ones. I thought Midnight In Paris was pretty good but I felt like its idea wasn't explored well enough and it became too repetitive. Blue Jasmine is a film that feels like it'll be another basic story at first then as the tragedy slowly unravels, it becomes all the more fascinating. At first the film's structure of flashbacking without transition is a little frustrating as the present time doesn't give you much to chew on in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that this was the only way to tell this brilliant and complex story of a woman's place in the world. Cate Blanchett is setting the reviews on fire and she certainly deserves it. I've always loved her engrossing theatrical style in films like The Aviator and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and I've missed her since.",2013
9,"What a treat! Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance as a Blanche-like character written and directed by the most prolific American author of the last 40 years. Cate seems to be an actress without emotional borders. Jasmine walks a very tight rope, her sense of despair etched in her magnificent face vanishes ipso facto when she meets Peter Sarsgaard. She realizes in a sort of disbelief -extraordinary, heartbreaking and horribly funny moment - that he could be the rescue raft in her own personal tsunami. Sally Hawkins, another stroke of genius in the casting department, is a profoundly human creature very much the Stella of the situation. This two sisters, adopted both from different parents are also from different, if immediately recognizable, universes. I could go on and on but I'm not going to, I just wanted to urge you, in this times of 3D super extra loud marvel sequels, to run and see it.",2013
9,"If you want to see this year's master class in screen acting, you need to watch Cate Blanchett's mesmerizing performance as Jasmine French, a delusional Park Avenue socialite wife in Woody Allen's 45th directorial effort, a sly, bicoastal update of Tennessee Williams' classic ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". As the film opens, her impeccably dressed character has hit rock bottom after her financial wizard of a husband is arrested and her assets are liquidated. In the throes of a nervous breakdown, she arrives in San Francisco and moves in with her kind- hearted sister Ginger who lives a modest, blue-collar life in a tiny apartment on the edge of the Mission – on South Van Ness near 14th Street to be exact - with her two hyperactive sons. You can tell Jasmine is not only out of her element but quite judgmental about how her sister's life has turned out. The irony of Jasmine's patronizing attitude is that she is a habitual liar who is so angry about her destitute circumstances that she frequently talks to herself. The story follows the basic outline of ""Streetcar"" but takes some interesting turns, for instance, when she tries to better herself by taking computer classes while working as a receptionist at a dental office.",2013
9,"Woody Allen's finely tuned screen-writing skills and his talent for eliciting standout and often award-winning performances from his leading ladies are on full display in ""Blue Jasmine."" Alec Baldwin, the slick husband of a middle-aged socialite, Cate Blanchett, pulls a Bernie-Madoff swindle and ends up in jail. The homes, the cars, the furs, the jewels, the furniture all go to the Feds, and the penniless Cate flies first class to San Francisco with her Louis Vuitton luggage to stay with her non-biological sister, Sally Hawkins, until she gets back on her feet. Blanchett, the Jasmine of the title, is totally unprepared for her economic fall. She decides to become an interior designer, but wants to study on-line; however, she is computer illiterate and must take a course, before she can begin to study decorating; but, she needs money for the courses and takes a receptionist job with a lecherous dentist. Although the film addresses serious issues, the Allen humor will provoke smiles and an occasional chuckle, from small well-observed moments such as the attempts of indecisive patients to make dental appointments.",2013
10,"Loved the script, loved the cast, loved all the performances, but dear God, Cate Blanchett was so incredible I couldn't catch a breath. What a performance! So many emotions at the same time, so multi-layered, subtle and yet unbearable.... She takes a character one normally wouldn't really care about where she ends up to someone, who despite her tragic and repeated mistakes and the fact that she made her own bed, you send up caring about, you end up understanding her. ",2014
10,Cate Blanchett gives her best acting performance of all time. Her character changes dramatically every scene. There will be nominations in the future for CB - in my opinion. Woody Allen punk-ed himself with the French nanny angle. Andrew Dice Clay was spectacular. Sally Hawkins stole many scenes in this movie. ,2013
9,when the movie was over the audience sat there somewhat stunned and completely silent... was crazy... crazy is the literal word to use.,2013
10,"Best Woody's made in years, a tour de force by Cate Blanchett and great support from Sally Hawkins and all the cast. For anyone who loves 'Streetcar' this is a sly and skillful homage, updating some threads for 21st century life while lifting other scenes almost directly from Elia Kazan's 1950s classic. Happily the wife-beating is in the past, but Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) is nevertheless Jasmine's nemesis, a brooding presence and harbinger of doom for the NY socialite whose life is unraveling before us. I don't usual wince audibly in the theatre but some scenes are so raw and toe-curling I couldn't help it, you're constantly oscillating between laughter and tears.",2014
9,"I have never been interested in any Woody Allen films in the past, but over the course of the past year or so, I have gradually become interested in his films and I'm glad because he is actually a film genius, as evident from this film, Blue Jasmine. Blue Jasmine offers a roller-coaster ride of emotions from light comedy to downright depressing. Woody offers up his distinct style of dialog in his screenplay and it's put to good use by Cate Blanchett who delivers one of her best career performances.",2014
6,"One of the better movies Woody Allen has put out in recent years, featuring superior performances by Cate Blanchett as an emotionally unstable woman forced to come down from her privileged past and Sally Hawkins as her enabling lower-income sister. Allen's screenplay is often amusing although it meanders at times (I looked at my watch more than once during the screening I attended) and its story seems uncomfortably reminiscent of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Blanchett in the Blanche DuBois role, Sally Hawkins as Stella, Peter Sarsgaard as Mitch and Bobby Cannavale as Stanley Kowalski. It lacks the dramatic power and sexual tension of Tennessee Williams' masterpiece and in the end, Allen's urbane sophistication doesn't make up for it.",2013
9,"Ceaselessly the woman talks at the elderly lady next to her: on the plane, at the airport, waiting for their luggage. Only when her husband picks her up, she is able to free herself from the incessant flood of words. This is how Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen's latest film begins. It ends with the same woman sitting down on a park bench, talking again. The lady sitting beside her gets up and leaves, the talker does not even notice. In these two scenes – so similar and yet so different – Allen frames his tale of Jasmine whose real name is Jeanette. A woman who, married to a rich financial entrepreneur, once was at the heart of New York City's high society. Now she must relocate to San Francisco, to live with her despised sister. When her husband's criminal activities were discovered and he subsequently hung himself in his cell, she lost everything: her jewels, her money, her footing, her mental balance. This is Woody Allen's take on the financial crisis, bankers spun out of control, the Bernie Madoffs of this world.",2014
8,The former socialite Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) travels from New York to San Francisco to stay in the simple house of her stepsister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) that lives with her two sons. Jasmine was married with the successful businessman Hal (Alec Baldwyn) that felt in disgrace for being considered a crook and committed suicide in prison. Jasmine is completely broken and mentally unstable with recollection from her previous social life and uses anti-depressive along the day. ,2014
4,"This is not an enjoyable film. I could appreciate Cate Blanchette's truly great performance but after a while I hoped there would be something else. It is obviously a morality tales about the section of New York society that is shallow, materialistic and callous, but we got this message and all about Jasmine fairly quickly. There was nothing else - that was it. As we continued to follow her downward path, I had expected the ray of light about the future. Instead we got a more detailed description of the past, even though she had already told us all there was to know about her history. There was never a sign that the penny had dropped about what was really important in life. All we ever got was an indication that things were going to get even worse without even a hint of redemption. Thoroughly depressing. When they give out the Oscar I can say I saw it, but that is a small consolation.",2013
10,Kate Blanchett deserves best actress for her performance in Blue Jasmine.,2013

5,"This Allen film has some pedigree and within the first 30 minutes its clear he has sharpened the pencil well for the writing of his principal character, Jasmine or Jeanette.",2014
6,"is a good movie but it's not the best of Allen ...does not have the complexity of""Melinda And Melina"" nor the dramatic depth of Annie Hall...but with great actresses like Cate Blanchett all is best ... is inspired in the""Madoff Asunto"" but the lack of depth of history wasted what could have been a good psychological thriller...is wasted to a great actor like Alec Baldwin granting him only fleeting appearances and it seems that Allen's films while less wealth script are more colorful are the photograph as to compensate (I remember Manhattan in black and white or opacity of Annie Hall that not undermined the excellent screenplay) My final words: you have to see it because it's Woody...is acceptable ... and it can enjoy the Cate Blanchett beauty",2014
1,"Woody may have once been a comedian, but he now has produced one of the most depressing movies in years. Even Cate Blanchett cannot save this derivative, dark and pointless study in modern melt downs a la Bernie Madoff. He also makes the ultimate cardinal sin of modern film making; letting the geography completely contradict the action and tone of the film. What is left is an emotional jumble that never lets the audience breathe. And the ultimate problem is that Woody just has not only lost his sense of place, but the characters do not work when the emotional drift is all down hill. Woody, San Francisco may not be your cup of tea, but as a back drop, it is not New Orleans. If you are going to do Streetcar Named Desire, you have to be able to show a little more of real emotion, and realistic doom and despair. This film is an idea that was never worked out. Because the real tragedy here is the film itself, not the plot.",2013
1,"Jasmine lives the privileged life of a socialite in her sumptuous New York apartment - until her handsome, smooth-talking husband is exposed as a philandering real estate fraud and commits suicide in jail, leaving behind a mountain of debt.

1,I have no idea what movie the people who rated this highly were watching. It certainly wasn't the one that me and a couple hundred other people watched today. Every conversation I overheard walking out was about how the acting was great but the movie was awful. There were a few people whose conversations I didn't overhear because they left the movie early.,2013
4,"Predictable, obvious, conventional, trite, and stereotypical are words that came to mind as I seethed, mumbling in my seat, watching a film that was ""acclaimed"" by many critics. Unfortunately this was another Woody Allen writing and directorial disappointment and that makes me angry. I really wanted Allen to embrace me with sensitivity and conviction; to make me laugh and cry, to create characters that were distinctive and demonstrated individuality like he did in the 1999 film SWEET AND LOWDOWN. Instead BLUE JASMINE, which ostensibly speaks about class divide, pretension, financial immorality, and the fickleness of relationships, focuses on a woman named Jasmine played by Cate Blanchett who is in the midst of having a nervous breakdown and moves in with her ""lower-class"" sister in San Francisco.",2013

1,"Star Trek Into Darkness should be renamed Star Trek In Name Only. What has always distinguished Star Trek from other sci-fi is the thoughtful and nuanced way that philosophical and sociological commentary was woven into the stories. Star Trek is not just a lot of sci-fi nonsense but a meaningful exploration of what it means to be human. In the past, Star Trek has been intelligent and character driven. Now it is all fancy CGI and snappy one-liners. Abram's Star Trek is an action-for-action's sake Kirk and Spock buddy flick. The ""surprises"" Abrams plants aren't surprises if you're familiar with the Star Trek universe. His preference for violence and political intrigue makes Abrams' vision more Star Wars than Star Trek.",2013

9,After seeing this show wondered why we don't have more types of TV like this made in Australia. ,2013
9,"One of the advantages of having a multi-region DVD player is being able to watch programs from all over the world; hence, I get to watch Dr. Blake (Craig McLachian). The series is set in 1950's Australia in the town of Ballarat. Having served his turn in the army as a doctor assigned to the British hospital in Singapore, Blake was witness to atrocities, served time in a POW camp, and lost both his Asian wife (died) and daughter (orphanage). There are hints he also worked for British Intelligence; but now he has returned home, taken up his father's practice, and serves as the police surgeon (medical examiner). With his curious nature, he quickly finds himself working as amateur detective. While he has a somewhat combative relationship with boyhood friend. now Chief Supt,. Matthew Lawson (Joel Tobeck), they generally find themselves working together to sort out the crimes and catch the criminal. ",2015
10,"Just found this in the UK and loved it. It is a classic example of the period detective genre like 'Ripper Street' or 'Murdoch Mysteries' with a little bit of 21st century hindsight. That is par for the course. I didn't find Blake at all grumpy - quite the opposite. I get a little fed up with the short tempered detectives of the likes of Frost or DCI Banks. But Blake is anything but that. Setting the series in Ballarat rather than Melbourne also allows it to have the feel of a small town environment that the Aussies seem to love to do. Think of 'Blue Heelers', 'A Country Practice' or (dare I mention them) some of their soaps. As with most Australian dramas there is an underlying positiveness - despite the traumatic past that the characters might have had.",2013
9,"The Doctor Blake Mysteries may not quite be among my favourite shows of all time, but it's a riveting series that keeps getting better and one of the better detective drama shows in recent years. Unfortunately, it's buried within BBC's daytime television scheduling and aired at a time where most people will be at school or work, and the show deserves better than that.",2015
8,"A nice little gem out of Australia. The premise about Dr. Lucien Blake, a police surgeon (kind of like an earlier era law enforcement medical examiner) who can't escape the shadow of his super successful father, also a doctor is intriguing. Blake (portrayed with a steady hand by Craig McLachlan) makes a few totally human assumptions along the way in each weeks mystery. This means he messes up and sometimes is lead down the wrong path before finding the right one. I like this because it means there aren't too many ridiculous jumps in logic when the sleuthing happens and the clues are followed. Sometimes the mysteries can be solved by the audience before the end but sometimes not. Again, I like something that makes me think a bit. Its also nice to watch a show from Australia that doesn't feature the tired stories about bubble heads hanging out on a beach or some forgettable vapid slapstick comedy thing. Great show, solid cast, nice tidy little, well-written under-an-hour whodunits. Grab a cup of tea or Java and have a sit-down and watch this show if you like mysteries.",2015

9,A charming return to life in Australia in the 50's. ,2013
9,"Craig Maclachlan is a revelation in this. I had only ever seen him in Neighbours or as a pop star. He is great as Dr Lucien Blake - the part really suits him and he is totally convincing as a doctor. When I first watched this I took no notice of the cast list and just thought ""there is something familiar about that guy""! It took most of the first episode before the penny dropped. It is a pity that the programme has been buried away in the BBC's daytime schedule. I am convinced that it would draw an evening audience were it to be shown then. It is certainly a cut above Midsomer Murders et al. What helps the reality is the fact that all the actors are unknown over here in the UK. I have seen two series now and the quality has not dropped at all.",2014
9,Starting watching this show on PBS last year and it is excellent. It gives a view of what Australia and the Far East was like politically after WW2 which is not very well understood by Americans. Hope the show continues with more of the rich political history of Australia. Acting and character development is good. Surprised by the writes tackling difficult topics and give a slant on them that most Americans can learn from. Mysteries are sometimes obvious but still worth watching. PBS should keep this series coming to America. Australia is such an interesting country which has an extraordinary rich history and this show gives a peek at it. Keep up good work,2016
10,"This series takes the history of its setting very seriously, the costumes are top notch and if the ""murder of the week"" genre is a bit overused, I think this is one of its best manifestations on TV. I find the acting top-notch, which makes characters very easy to love or dislike (and the cast is quasi-exclusively Australian). Some have complained about how slow it can be, I think it's a welcome change from testosterone-fueled action series and it suits the character profiles much better. There's a very distinct atmosphere to this show, a bit different but very appealing in my opinion and I would recommend it to pretty-much anybody.",2016
10,I just ran across this show on Netflix and just really fell in love with it. I was sadden to learn it was canceled by ABC really don't understand why. Greatly written awesome acting.

9,"Recommended series. Lucien Blake (Craig McLachlan) is an ex-POW now practicing medicine in post-WW2 Ballarat, Australia who gives the local police headaches by his obsessive refusal to accept the obvious explanation when called to the scene of a murder in his official capacity. Engaging characters, elegant ensemble acting, and fantastic period sets make this a winner for those who love a good murder mystery. Close attention is required for those who don't speak Australian. Erotic tension between the Doctor and his no-nonsense practice manager/housekeeper Jean (Nadine Garner) adds spice to the mix. Despite being it's highest rated show, the series inexplicably has been canceled by the network. Yet another Dr. Blake Mystery.",2017

8,"I love this show more for nostalgic reasons. I use to live in Melbourne, Victoria for 4 years and loved Ballarat and Bendigo. I lived in a state that had a large Italian/Greek population and many of the characters that have appeared on the show absolutely look like that. The character is a bit withdrawn and wooden, but then that was typical back in those times. I grew up in Perth, the west coast, and most of the men back then were restrained. The housekeeper reminded me of some of my aunts keeping a stiff upper lip and all emotions to yourself. Some of the plots are very good, and some kind ah. I am looking forward to the next season.",2017

2,"Most of these reviews are years old; this is 2017 and brand new. I give ""Doctor Blake"" a 2 out of 10, only because of the saving grace of Craig McLachlan, who deserves far better treatment than he receives as Lucien Blake. So far, in my short viewing history, I've seen the Police Chief du Jour change three times, and each officer is more antagonistic towards the good doctor than the last. Blake solves every murder, treats everyone with kindness and over-extended courtesy, he's a highly skilled medical guy and should be Prime Minister of Australia! WHY IN GOD'S NAME DO PEOPLE TREAT HIM LIKE HE'S A LEPROUS RAPIST???? I'm watching (for the last time) his persecution at the hands of the current Police Chief (can't be bothered remembering his name; he'll be gone by next week)who wants to know why he - Blake -- doesn't file his reports faster, accusing him of stalling, then just hanging out for a few days, leisurely screwing up the police work in Ballarat. Dumb and Dumber, as is the somewhat surly attitude of Mz. Jean, who must be related to all the police chiefs. Attitude is everything, and this show is drowning in Bad Attitude!",2017
2,"The cast is very dull for this series and they seem to change every season. The viewer is never informed on why some characters exit the show from season to season. The lead actor Craig McLachlan has to be one of the most wooden actors on the planet and dull as dull can be. Why he was cast in the lead role is beyond my comprehension. The background music is also awful. I do not understand why this series is so popular. The plots are plodding and boring and as each episode approaches its conclusion, I could care less who committed the murder. And, another question I keep asking myself is why a coroner is solving crimes. This show may be popular in Australia, but I would much rather watch ""Happy Valley"", ""Vera"", or ""Marcella"" which are all far superior. It baffles me why PBS has chosen this show for viewing.",2017
10,"A show based on a small town, Ballarat, located in Australia. A town, much like any one might choose to settle in to raise a family amid the trials of everyday life. Set in an era, which gave the world a chance for a new start. Death, murders, yes! Relationships, drama, life changing events all filmed and portrayed with an eye for detail to the era. The Doctor Blake Mysteries drew me in like those of the grand lady, Agatha Christie, whose works set the standard to period mystery dramas. With each episode, I found myself to be not only a viewer, but, a participant in solving the mysteries. I felt to be a part of the good doctor's household, or a member of the town observing and anticipating the events as they unfolded. Each portrayal of the wonderful characters gives one the sense of belonging. Each episode challenges the mind and the hearts of its viewers.",2017
3,"This is one of the most unconvincing, and confusing episodes I have ever seen. I had hoped it would be witty, clever, and really entertaining but how wrong I was! The first episode feels as if you have been dropped into an ongoing story with no explanation of who the characters are. Hints are dropped as to their relationship but one never quite figures it out. The story lines are confusing, the acting fake and wooden. The dialog is trite and childish. I could only manage 2 episodes before chucking it in! While this may prove appealing to a local Aussie audience, I don't see it having much global appeal, given the plethora of TV series from many different countries that are now offered on multiple streaming services.",2017
6,"Great acting and character dynamics in my view, and the plots are good and engaging. My problem with the series so far though is the attempt to inject politics and social views in the plot structures. While I'm not completely averse to opposing views being expressed in a show or series, I do find it distracting when the expressions are one-sided and in conflict with the tempo of the time setting regardless of the perceived benefits to the audiences.",2017
9,"We started watching Doctor Blake last year thanks to our local PBS station. To be honest, it took a few episodes to grow on me. My initial turn-off wasn't the content of the show but rather the dark filming. When they lightened up the filming a bit, I started enjoying it so much more. It also allowed us to see more vividly the beauty of Australia. I'm on my second viewing of the show through season four and am loving it this time around even more.",2017

That was my mind set going into watch this film. ""Homefront"", isn't your usual Statham film, and it's nice to see it play out the way it did. A change of pace for Statham movies, and hopefully a turning point for the actor. But let's keep things simple: Story: Good Acting: Good Action: Very Good Pacing: Good If you're looking for a good action film with a lot of heart, watch this. It's not bad.",2013
9,"At first glance most Jason Statham movies are pretty much about the same thing. Some quiet, keep to himself guy finds himself using exceptional fighting skills against the bad guys. Turns our he's usually the fastest gun, in this case fist in the west. This time Jason Statham is a retired-likely forced retired DEA agent who raising his daughter after his wife and her mother pass away. They move to a quiet town somewhere in Louisiana and settle in. When his daughter gets harassed by the local bully in school, she drop kicks him into another dimension--hey, she did warn him before she broke the fat tub of lard's nose. Next we meet his mother, a very loud, unrecognizable Kate Bosworth who disrespects both daughter and Statham. When she fails at intimidating him by having her husband try to assault him in the school parking lot-a one-two takedown by Statham, she enlists the help of local meth kingpin brother, James Franco. There is a back story in the beginning and some actual character development dealing with Statham's former life and an undercover cop. Frank Zito, who in my opinion is very under rated both as a character actor and villain in this case, steals the opening sequence as motorcycle gang leader bent on revenge. This movie has some exceptional fight scenes, explosions, and very intense show down between Franco and Statham that was actually pretty surprising and satisfying. This is a Jason Statham movie but a strong supporting cast of Franco and Zito steal the show as both small time and big time antagonists. Action fans will enjoy this latest blend of action and drama from the last true action star of this genre. At 100 minutes, its just long enough to hold your interest. Surprisingly, Statham's last few films have contained some human elements to their stories. While it's not going to win any major awards, this movie is sure to please action fans and others looking for a decent night out at the movies.",2014

If you like those movies with ex special forces, ex military, ex special agent or someone who's just a solo destroyer, this is the movie for you. Jason Statham is so underrated and needs to be more known for his acting in these great action movies he's in. The story is a simple base line and that's all you really need for having such a good actor; Jason Statham. Great film overall! Definitely would recommend this movie to action lovers, especially those who like to see amazing take downs, and showing the enemies who's the boss.",2014

2,"Jason Statham is a decent actor. He will never trouble Shakespeare true but he has carved out a nice niche for himself and proved he could act in films like Snatch, Lock Stock and the Bank Job. Sadly he is wasted here along with the rest of what is a talented cast.",2014
3,"I suppose it's not surprising that Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay, since the plot is so ancient it might have been etches as hieroglyph on Rambo's machine gun. There's an appeal to simple action movie, but it's nowhere to be found on the uninspiring Homefront, and even the capable cast can't save it from mediocrity. Either it's from the poor casting or lackluster predictable content, audience will most likely have little to none enjoyment watching Jason Statham bludgeoning random thugs, again.",2013
3,"If you're a Jason Statham fan, as I am, you will be disappointed with this film. The action scenes are few, brief, and scattered, and the ""sensitive"" scenes with his daughter are labored and painful. Statham shows more concern for his cat than his daughter. ""Hey, Jason. Not everyone can be a well-rounded actor. Take some kudos from your roles as an action hero and spare us the sensitive roles."" Of course Statham is not the only one to blame here. The screenplay from Stallone is by-the-numbers and has so many cliché scenes it's embarrassing to watch. Stallone has written some excellent films (""Rocky"", ""First Blood"") but he also has some real duds (""Cobra"", ""Rhinestone"") and this is clearly one of those duds.",2013
1,"Thinly plotted? That's forgivable. Contrived? That's not the worst thing that can happen to a movie. But the F-bomb in every sentence of the movie, used as every part of speech in some? Stallone wrote the screenplay, which must indicate that Sly has lost some brain cells somewhere along the way and can't think of English words that might be used as dialog. Stallone must have written 500 F words into this movie. Really, if the 10 year old actress in this movie was on the set for more than 2 minutes, Stallone should be reported for child abuse just for exposing her to the awful repetition of ""f'ing"" this and ""f that."" There were literally points in the movie where there was loud action (think 12 gouge shotgun going off right beside your ear) and somehow Stallone managed to have someone off-screen mutter ""F...!!"" Do not see this if you like meaningful or even trite dialog in your movies. I literally lost IQ points sitting through it.",2013
2,"It definitely was really long time since I had not seen such a bad movie. Jason Statham is not acting but seem loosing his time playing a role that has no substance, a smile here, another smile there. There is still a couple of action scenes that bring some excitement, but no more. Many technical elements are typically old fashioned, Rocky Balboa style, hard blue lights creating a false night ambiance pulling you out the action. The screenplay itself is insubstantial, containing crucial errors like the fact that Broker would let the secret file containing all details of his previous life as an undercover cop, right on the top of an open box in his open basement. Such a silly point plays indeed a crucial role in the development of the screenplay, making the whole structure ridiculous. Some characters of the story also appear and disappear as for instance the teacher who seems to have a key role to play but who's totally missing from the second part of the movie... Some of the action scenes are not credible, like the killing of the mob's son at the very beginning who's supposed to received 47 bullets! So if you want to keep in mind the good Jason Statham, just avoid this movie and the Expendables by the way!",2014
8,"I enjoyed this film. But, to be fair, they have been making this specific type of film since the 70s and I enjoyed them then, I enjoy them now. (Back in the day, this would have been a Charles Bronson film, or Chuck Norris film, or a Lee Marvin film). No I will not mislead you or tell you untruths. This is not an original story. It is a specific story which, depending on the actors and the direction, either works or does not work. Films like this never make it to the Oscars and often they don't do well in reviews either. But they can be fun. If you read the other reviews you already know the backstory -- the reason this specific formula was resurrected from the Script Graveyard and given the A-List treatment -- it was written/developed by Sly Stallone. Sly is too slick and too smart to let any property sit idle, so he ""slyly"" (sorry) picked Statham to play the lead. Once again, before anyone takes exception, I will note that my review of Hummingbird -- the first major film where Statham showed his acting ""chops"" -- was very popular in this database, so I feel entitled to make a final call. Which is this -- good movie. Could have been great, but it did OK, considering the part was not originally written for the actor who played the main role. And the heavies were (to be fair) just a tad over-written. I mean, if you have ever watched Justfied, you already know that the friendly overweight woman who runs the General Store in back mountain country is probably a serial killer. And the local deputy is corrupt and related to the judge. So, with such a rich assortment to draw upon, why import heavies? Final comment: I thought Izabela Vidovic as the daughter stole every scene she was in, most especially the opening (which arguably -- and this is not unusual in action films -- was the best single setup in the production) where she whips the snot out of a local bully who is twice her size after patiently and earnestly explaining to him that she warned him -- twice.",2013

And he played that role pretty good. There are some thing you could resent him, but all in all for first time he was good. And his daughter in a movie is just like you could expect his daughter would be. So that part is well made. The story was not so good and predictable. James Franco played villain part very well.

",2013
10,"This lovely movie was based on Doris Lessing's short story ""The Grandmothers"". I just saw the premiere at Sundance and absolutely loved it. Supposedly inspired by a true story, it's about two mothers who really like their son's best friend (their best friend's son) And that tag line is what you'll hear all about. Oh, the horror. I imagine middle age male reviewers will not particularly like this movie, though gay men will most likely love it. But it's a film about women--their friendships, husbands, relationships, sons and lovers. It's directed by Anne Fontaine, a French woman (which explains the exorbitant number of scenes with smoking cigarettes, and an insanely un-American story concept that young men might be attracted to older women.)

This is a very good romance of the forbidden, and the players are all very open, and involved. The main story would seem to be from a time just before texting, as there are things that would not happen today for that simple fact. Watts, and Wright do an excellent job of remaining vibrant, and youthful as they continue to age, and try to hide their flaws. Life just works out, and we find a way to fit into it as it changes, that does not mean that it always works out the way that it is supposed to.

8,"Robin Wright has sure moved on from the Princess Bride and is far and away the best thing in Anne Fontaine's latest film to reach these shores. Fontaine has long been one of the finest directors in France, male or female and there is nothing here to indicate she is losing her sure-footedness. I confess I was surprised to find the film was in English from Fade In to Fade Out and slightly intrigued that Fontaine had opted to shoot it in Australia though not having read the source material it may well be that Fontaine is being faithful to Lessing's setting. All the performances are excellent but Robin Wright is beyond excellent and makes it so easy to understand why anyone, let alone a young man, would fall in love with her. For the third time in barely two weeks I have witnessed yet another Best Actress Oscar performance although I tend to agree with another person writing here that Oscar snobbery will probably ensure that neither the film nor Wright attract even a nomination. This is a beautiful film with one towering performance and I urge you to see it.",2013

Naomi Watts as Lil and Robin Wright as Roz are beautiful, gorgeous, great friends from childhood and cherish each others opinions and advice. Each has a son and Lil's son Ian( Xavier Samuel from Twilight??) and Roz's son Tom (James Frecheville)grow up as best buddies, swimming and surfing in the beautiful waters. All four, Lil and Roz on the beach , basking in the sun , laying on the sands and Ian and Tom in the waters surfing make a great foursome. Ian and Roz are mistaken for lesbians just because they do not show any interest in other men. Well, Roz has a husband but Ian has strong passionate feelings for Roz. He is in love with Roz. Initially , Lil finds it unbelievable that her best friend who knows Ian as a baby could be sexually involved with her son. She , in return, ends up reciprocating Tom's sexual advances. Ian has true feelings for Roz and Tom has sexual feelings for Lil. Eventually, friends decide to put an end to the relationship and let the ""young Gods"" go free. Ian never wanted to be away from Roz whereas Tom was involved with another young stage actress when he was away in Sydney just for a month.

3,"The characters in Adoration (previously called Adore and Two Mothers at various film festivals), belong in their own isolated little world that is self-absorbed, irresponsible and one that I had little interest visiting. French director Anne Fontaine (Coco Before Chanel) and British screenwriter Christopher Hampton (Atonement) come to the conclusion that some people are afraid of growing old and would prefer to spend their days with those who are much younger. They abandon their social responsibilities and families, so they can play together at the beach. This is a film that seems divorced from any moral sensibilities. In the film's production notes it says that the unjudging hand of its filmmaker was deliberate. This film needed serious judgment: someone to rewrite the underwritten draft of the script and to have a firmer opinion on these terribly unappealing characters. ",2013

You know the type, the 1s you find in the Love section of a book store, the 1s that are later tucked away in the back of a middle aged woman's bookshelf. The movie is what you might expect it to be, the story is somewhat silly and the dialogue gets quite cheesy in places, but really that shouldn't be surprising. Much the same can be said about the acting and directing. That of course is not to say that the movie is bad, in fact it's actually quite good, within it's genre. The story is comprehensive, and plays out well, not giving you any of horrible moments confusion or unrealistic stupidity. It also has a lovely beachy, erotic sense to it, and thus provides a good setting/vibe to the storyline. Yes it's predictable and fairly generic, but honestly I'd say it's quite hard to exactly hit generic these days, and this film does it. In short, you'll like it if you like softcore romance novels.",2013

When tom later has his payback with lil tension grows which all the actors in this film portrayed well, as time goes they all become friends.

3,"""Adore"" is generally stultifying and implausible. Though based on a Doris Lessing story, the story arc seems to come from somewhere beyond that of Diane Kurys's 1983 masterpiece ""Entre Nous"" with Isabelle Huppert. Two blonde Australian women who are lifelong friends find themselves deeply planted in middle age and sleeping with each other's sons. One wonders whether this is a type of emotional lesbianism by proxy or whether it is an indictment of the formulations of female self-esteem, craving, as the leads seem to, male attention at any price. The male characters of this film are cardboard cut-outs. The story takes on incest overtones and yet still bores. The otherwise exceptional Naomi Watts barely inhabits her role, and every opportunity for the finding of meaning and depth in this movie is one the filmmakers either miss or trip over.",2014

Although I don't speak or understand Spanish and just rely on the subtitles, I still really enjoy this show tremendously. The story line about true love, social class differences, sacrifices and other hurdles make this series very interesting, (and educational to me). I am hooked on watching this series that I can hardly wait for more seasons to come. I even started looking bits and pieces of the second season online. I wish the episodes that I found had subtitles on them so I could understand what they were saying, regardless, I watched them and still loved it. (I just used my own imagination and the actors' gestures to kind of figure out what they were saying or what is going on). The actors on this show are just amazing and they are all perfect for their given characters. Another interesting thing about this show was that although there are lead characters, the writers and producers managed to give everyone their own story line which really keep the series worth watching. Now, I am motivated to learn Spanish (hopefully, I could) just so I can re-watch this show again and again in the future. Please continue doing more episodes and more seasons. I thank you and more power to all the actors, writers, producers and everyone involve in creating this show. I salute you!",2015

The crux of the series is a great once-in-a-lifetime love, a love that should be the destiny of the boy & girl. But of course, everything is against them: their parents, their class difference, and financial issues. The two actors who play the leads couldn't be better. Both are gorgeous to look at AND terrific actors - what more could you ask for? Besides the main story, a number of secondary plots, both comic and tragic, will engage you.

There are some beautiful Spanish boleros and Pop selections that in our opinion would've made the scenes more profound and connected.

Most viewers will have watched the first three seasons several times as nothing else on TV compares to this series. Love it! Have suggested this series to many friends and although learning of the subtitles has deterred a few, most have decided once watched that it doesn't pose a problem as the actors do a great job with body language and the soft Spanish lingo is a delight to the ears. I've also picked up a few Spanish phrases. For anyone learning the language it's a great tutorial. The stories are very realistic.

I really enjoyed the 2 seasons and looking forward to see more. Thank you to all of you for being the Best.

6,"Excellent production design and very good actors all round. Beautiful costumes and period cars and gorgeous people. Both Ana And Alberto are engaging and Christina and others are elegant and handsome. I enjoyed the series until Alberto cannot forgive Ana for not having gone through a secret ceremony. Their love was grand and lasted the years even though they came from very different backgrounds. She sacrificed everything for the people and the company and this seems to escape Alberto, who quickly adapts to Christina. He said at first he hates the life of country clubs but now succumbs to everything. Very disappoint and confusing that the writers are not consistent with character. I hope in the third part they will find each other and Alberto would be stronger With his desires.",2015
8,"Most of the actors did a good job in this TV series. However, there are 2 actors who really stood out.",2017
9,The fashion (both men's and women's) and cars of this era were beautiful. The story line from beginning to end ran through all emotions but the friendships were wonderful. One thing I noticed throughout the series was the acting was so spot-on and I'm hard to please when it comes to watching movies. I would have liked a season five.,2017
10,Oh puhleeze make more seasons!!! PUHLEEZE PUHLEEZE PUHLEEZE!!!! I'm drawing close to the end of Season 4! HELP!!!,2017
10,"I just finish watching all 4 series I absolutely love it, I couldn't stop watching .I'm not working now so I was able to put in 7-8 hours a day finishing in two weeks. After ending I was just lose for words. I love clothes , the hair styles and cars . This series was funny and warm. I especially love the way way Alberto would look at Ann it was if there was nothing else matter in this world . They were such great actors together I thought maybe they dating in real life. I was hurt they weren't. The music was everything I mean everything absolutely the best. Who ever choose music for this beautiful series need a bonus. I can't stop listening to ""Since you been gone "" . The wedding song in four season was the best "" fly away with me"". Last but not least all the actors were great and very entertaining. I don't speak Spanish at all so I had read the television the all four season I enjoyed the show so much it didn't matter. I only hope your show returns for 5 series Love ,Love,Love !!!",2017
10,"In a world of television that is inundated with murder, senseless comedy, ridiculous reality TV and violence, I found Velvet to be so refreshing! This show took me back to a much more innocent era and I loved seeing the costumes, the automobiles, and the way women back then presented themselves.",2017
9,I like the show and the characters in it...,2016
9,Watch season one and two on Netflix. We are waiting for them to add season 3. Season 3 recently finished showing in Spain. The setting is 1950's Madrid and focuses on the family who owns an exclusive department store and their employees. ,2016
8,"I came across this series, while searching Netflix for a good romantic movie. I eventually (binged) watched both seasons 1 & 2 and am absolutely hooked! The casting, the music (I even purchased the soundtrack from Amazon Spain), the story line are excellent. I appreciate that it is an authentic and realistic story. The story centers around the love interest of the main characters Alberto and Ana and the store, Velvet Galleria.",2015
10,The series is well conceived. The acting is convincing and executed properly.,2018
9,"We love this show; saw the first three seasons; never watched fewer than two per sitting. The acting was flawless. ""Raul"" and ""Christina"" are standouts.
 
But the final episode of Season 3 left too much unresolved and unexplained.
",2018
6,"Glad to have found this on Netflix (watched with english subtitles). Just finished watching. The characters, acting, costumes, were amazing. Love this time period. 
 The thing that bothered me most was the inconsistent time line (maybe due to translation, I don't know), and the unrealistic scenarios. For instance, one of the characters needs to get pregnant by her husband because she's pregnant by another man, and a few days after she has sex with her husband she says, ""It worked, I'm pregnant."" and the guy is excited. Like, um....you can't find out you're pregnant 2 days after you have sex - duh! This happened multiple times throughout the series, not to mention countless other inconsistencies with the timeline. Come on! Another example, someone goes to the doctor and walks out with a diagnosis that isn't possible in an hour. Some of the things were absolutely ridiculous, but a lot of the show was good. The other thing that annoyed me was how the business was run. No one just walks in and starts a product line without any prior business experience, etc. Puleeze. The more I write, the more I'm disappointed with the show. But, I loved so many of the characters. You definitely have your ""heros"" and ""villians"". ",2018
7,"Director Lasse Hallström pulls off a surprise ending to this otherwise seemingly ordinary romantic thriller; in doing so, he redeemed what would otherwise have been a movie not worth a mention. Sure, the movie is sweet for the most part and the dramatic moments are nothing to brag about, but Hallström has been hiding the real love story all along; when it's revealed in the last scenes, we ask ourselves, how could I have not seen this and then you melt. But you do have to stick it out to the end. I don't wish to spill the beans so I'll keep mum about it. I understand some viewers are not going to be interested in the movie because of the cast, but the director's following is not without merit; after all he delivered Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Chocolat and Cider House Rules, and it's his uncanny ability to tell a story like no others is what made me want to watch the movie.",2013
3,"Where to start?... I went to see that movie with uneasy feeling that I'm going to be disappointed and I was unfortunately right. For somebody who didn't read a book it is going to be another love story with a little thriller in it, for me it was a BAD adaptation of very excellent book. I actually knew from the beginning that movies rarely are better than book but some of them at least focus on a important details that are crucial for the storyline. This time like I suspected they missed the most important parts and replaced it with some cheap lovey dovey ""I love you"" moments. The escape part was showed fast and without pretty much explanation. OK. So we see husband that had too much to drink fighting with his wife, hits her couple of times, throws her on the floor than she grabs the knife and stabs him, after that she runs over to her neighbor and next thing we see is her buying a ticket and getting on the bus and leaving. The same time we can see her husband looking for her, stopping buses running like nothing had happened to him. No stab wounds. Nothing. The book was so much more intense. She was actually planning to escape for almost a year. Stealing money form his wallet, planning everything step by step. It was slow and nerve wracking process that made a reader chew his/her nails. In the movie everything happens so fast you don't even know when it started and when it ended. Also Katie's husband character wasn't showed like I would like it to be presented. He was psychopath, not only an alcoholic. His obsession with Bible and Bible's rules was a crucial point of that story. She didn't run away from abusive alcoholic husband, she run away from sick person. They didn't show it in the movie. They didn't show how twisted his mind was. I think sometimes, that he was the most important character in that story. David Lyons was a perfect for that role, I wish I could see more of his character on the screen that's all. Katie in a movie (payed by Hough) didn't convince me at all. She was looking healthy and pretty like she just came back from vacation, not run away from the hell. Katie in a book was scared, skinny, bitten up and tired. The process of her getting to know Alex was long. She didn't trust anyone for a long time. Josh Duhamel was a good choice in my opinion for Alex's character. He was good looking but not too good looking, he was very easy going, and acted very natural around the kids. But yet as a star of the movie his character was covering more important parts. It was just too much of him in some moments. The other thing they fail to do is to build up Jo character a little bit more. She was Katie's only friend there and they hang out together more often that they show in the movie. The very important conversation between two of them was missing in the movie and I felt like there was unfinished business out there. The turning point was oversimplified. Tierney finally found Katie and asked her to come home with him, when she declined he decided to burn the house down. In the book that process was slow and complex. From the very first time he sees them together to the last moment of his life, reader doesn't know what is going to happen. Why he decided to burn the place down with Katie in it?? Because bible says that when she cheats she will burn in internal flame. That was the reason why he started the fire in the first place. Alex again became a hero saving his daughter from the fire. In the book he didn't show up until everything was pretty much over. It was Katie who fought with Kevin and it was her who saved the kids. I give the movie 3+. If you didn't read the book it's going to be another love story out there. Nothing more, nothing less.",2013
4,"If someone were to tell me that the latest Nicholas Sparks novel-to-a-movie adaptation would be one that starred two ridiculously attractive actors playing characters who almost fall in love when a secret from the past that can keep them apart is revealed nearly thirty minutes before the movie ends ...

7,"I took my girlfriend to see this, mostly as she cant miss a love story film.... she wasn't disappointed with this. She loved every minute of it. As a male, I thought it was a bit wet, but still enjoyed it. Hough was an easy actress to watch, not only pretty, but accomplished at her art. This was seemingly written for her girlish look and persona. The scenery and cinematography were nothing short of amazing... Locations were perfect, id live there in a heartbeat.... Duhamal was frankly excellent in this role too, he played his part perfectly, and was the perfect choice for this film.",2013
5,"This latest film from Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom, based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, is terribly manipulative and sappy. Additionally, I thought the acting and dialogue were, for the most part, stilted and wooden, with every attempt to pull at your ""heartsrings"".",2013
9,"As human nature would have it, it's not a rare thing to fall in and out of love a number of times in one person's lifetime. But, then, there are those even more rare cases of finding the one true love that may occur only once in a person's life and lasting even longer than a lifetime. Relativity Media's ""Safe Haven"", directed by Lasse Hallstrom is a story about one of those such rare cases.",2013
8,"I watched Safe Haven knowing that Nicholas Sparks wrote the story, and not having read the book. This movie completely exceeded my expectations. As I write this, the tears are drying on my face. I believed the chemistry was there with the actors and the romance had a good build-up (not rushed). I like that the story was easy to follow. The actions scenes were well-directed and realistic. I like how the story incorporates action, suspense, drama, and romance, all in one. What really moved (shocked) me was the ending. It was so beautiful and I just started bawling. It was so moving. As a whole, I really enjoyed this movie.",2015

6,'Safe Haven' is from the same author as romantic classic 'The Notebook.' 'Safe Haven' is not exactly as generic as 'The Notebook' but it does qualify as pretty boring in terms of cinematic exploration. ,2013
7,Josh Duhamel was awesome in this movie. He played a sweet sensible guy that was perfect for Julianne Hough. This movie had a great plot with good romance combined with a mystery and drama. It was worth every penny I spent on valentines day. The final 10 minutes was probably my favorite part. It had a big twist that got me and has stuck with me since i saw it. The writing was excellent as was the directing. It was one of the better romance movies I have seen in a while. It was a perfect valentine movie. When I went I really didn't think that.,2013
3,"After watching this movie I just had to write review for the first time. If you have any expectations don't watch this movie. I didn't read the book, but this movie have killed my every wish to do that. It gives you feeling that scenes have been cut off, you gain no familiarity to characters, and they will never let you join the true story. Okay, we have some dark beginning, tormented women, who after 3 days at seaside forgets everything, looks amazing and so quickly falls for a guy that it is funny. I love Josh Duhamel, but that is all I loved about this movie. Everything happening so fast, but yet, making audience bored, well, that's a quality we most certainly look in a movie. I was so disappointed, that only tears coming from me were for my wasted time. I regret watching this ""la la la"" movie. Guess, Notebook was one of a kind for Sparks, and since then he just gets worse with time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.",2013
7,"I will not compare this movie with the novel on which it is based because I have not read it. ""Safe haven"" is not innovator at all, it is one more romantic drama with a quiet predictable ending, but at the same time, with some mystery and some twists that kept me amused and paying attention during its entire length. It is not as good as ""The notebook"", but it is better than ""Dear John"" and ""The lucky one"", in my opinion. Anyway, these four are very alike to each other and based on the respective novels written by the same author. Lasse Hallstrom proofs again he is an efficient director of dramas (I cannot say versatile, because he has not directed more genres ). He has been able to take advantage of the cast, which is not particularly great, but good enough. The photography is one of the best elements of the movie. It is mainly located in Northern Carolina (in a quiet coastal village) and I really liked the environment. The pace is fluid. It made me pay attention from the beginning. It does not obviously have the same pace that action movies should have. The plot contains just a few good unexpected twists and some flashbacks. The plot is easy to follow and adds no confusion, which is good. The acting is good enough. I am not a fan of any actor from this mo vie, but they all did a decent job and are believable in their respective roles. Josh Dushamel and Julianne Hough are the two leading ones, specially her, who is not famous at all. In conclusion, those who really like this sort of movies will surely enjoy this one even though it is not a top romantic drama. The intrigue and photography are added value. The cast is not great, but good enough. The film is well-paced, but it is not original at all. 7,25.",2013

10,I may be partial to the film having waited a long time to see it. As soon as I found out Julianne Hough had been cast (I' a long standing fan from back in her DWTS days!) I knew I just had to see the film! I went out and bought the book and quickly read it in a matter of days. ,2013

4,"¨There's no safer place for you than here with me.¨  Chicks will definitely love this film, but I found it to be yet another  recycled Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Sparks may have a fan base through  his novels and movie adaptations, but if he continues to write the same  movie over and over again he will eventually lose them all. I was a fan  of The Notebook because the relationship felt authentic and Sparks  writing was new to me, I really liked it, but Safe Haven is completely  flawed. Not only is it full of romantic clichés (we get to see another  canoeing scene in a lake interrupted by rain like in The Notebook), but  it has some of the worst plot twists I've seen in film history. I guess  it was an attempt from Sparks to make this film different from the  rest, but the suspense and thrills never worked. It felt like The  Stepfather with the melodrama from any chick flick you've seen. It's  too bad Safe Haven didn't work because I like Swedish director, Lasse  Hallstrom, who has made Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The  Cider House Rules, and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. This is one film  that he would probably want to erase from his resume. The writers in  charge of adapting Sparks' novel were Dana Stevens (City of Angels and  For Love of the Game) and Gage Lansky. The script was weak,  predictable, and extremely mushy. The film also suffers from a weak  lead performance from Julianne Hough who was much better in the  musicals she starred in: Burlesque and Rock of Ages. Her performance  never felt believable and that hurt the chemistry with her co-star Josh  Duhamel, who has also made a living off rom-coms like When in Rome, or  Life as We Know It. Those mediocre movies look like masterpieces when  compared to Safe Haven. Duhamel is a likable actor, but Hough's  performance made it difficult to tolerate this film.  The movie begins with a young scared girl named Katie (Julianne Hough)  making a frenetic escape from her hometown in Boston to a small North  Carolina town known as Southport. She's running from something, but we  are never shown exactly what happened. All we know is that something  happened in her home involving a knife and a man, and now she has cut  her hair and died it blonde and has escaped to this isolated place.  Police officer, Tierney (David Lyons), tries to hunt her down but gets  to the bus station a few seconds late. Katie decides that Southport is  the perfect place to start over and finds a nice little cabin in the  woods and a job at a local coffee shop. Katie tries to keep to herself,  but she forms a nice bond with a little girl named Lexie (Mimi  Kirkland) who is the daughter of widowed Alex (Josh Duhamel). Alex soon  falls for Katie's good looks and they grow closer together. However  Katie never mentions anything about her past. Katie also befriends her  neighbor, Jo (Cobie Smulders), who seems to always be there for her for  good advice. As Katie begins to fall for Alex more and more, she is  still haunted by her past and isn't sure what her next move should be.  Thus the melodrama begins.   Safe Haven had some beautiful shots of romantic locations, but it was  full of clichés and bad dialogues. At times while the music was playing  the film even felt like one long music video or commercial. Safe Haven  also suffers from an extensively long plot. At almost two hours I kept  waiting for the end to approach, and it never did. One plot twist after  another the film continued to grow increasingly tiring and tedious. By  the end if you thought the film was entertaining you will be left with  a bad taste in your mouth because the final twist is just ridiculous.  Yes the film is romantic and sweet and girls will love this movie, but  I don't think the male audience will be won over by the suspense and  thrills. It didn't work for me, there was just no depth to the  characters or the story.",2013

2,Technically a decent movie - However the worst possibly acting by Julianne Hough - 101 on how to be a blonde bland plastic doll and get everything wrong. Perhaps she needs some lessons from the little girl who does a great job.,2013
3,"This story line had so much potential with domestic abuse, redemption, love, family, but the screen writers TOTALLY missed the mark - Josh Duhamel does a decent job - not the vacuous role he is usually placed in and pulls off more than a pretty face here - David Lyons as the alcoholic Detective Tiernny and abusive husband of Hough shined - he seems made for bad guy roles - Julianne Hough - I think the girl has some potential as actor given a more meaty role but as stated this was painfully drawn out with idyllic lazy southern settings where IMPOSSIBLY in a town of 2000 no one questions the appearance of a newcomer and in fact embraces her without question (being from the south - that ""ain't"" how we operate - if you are in town for more than 48 hours we know everything about you if we have to pry it out with a velvet crowbar), impossible circumstances, clichés enough to fill a NY phone book.

I have to admit, before i continue, that I did miss the first 15 minutes of the film. However, I was easily able to catch up on the story within a couple of minutes. I was amazed at how closely this resembled another movie made in the 90s starring Julia Roberts. It's called With the Enemy. From the abusive husband stalking his runaway wife, to the small town escape locale, and sweet, sensitive new love interest - heck, even the 4th of July parade scene where it all goes wrong!

1,"Are you kidding me??? I mean seriously almost everything out of Hollywood lately seems to fall prey to the same qualities as this movie. Completely unbelievable, unrealistic, CGI overload, cheesy, and a horrible plot that absolutely insult's the intelligence of it's audience. If you are on drugs I'm sure you will like it because it's obvious the writers wrote this garbage stoned. This is the first time I have ever written review for any movie on this site which should tell you how tired I am of seeing the same junkie pathetic movies of late.

Having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked for this title, the movie to me was a big let down. Its slow moving, not as much action packed as I hoped it would be. And plot to me made no sense. {Spoiler Alert} I don't know if I got it wrong but in the movie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from Wolverine's body deprives him of his healing power. WTF ? More so it has been depicted to give the grandpa his(wolverine's) healing powers ! utter bullshit. Wolverine(Logan) was known for his healing power and that was the reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium. Did i miss something there ? There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I wished I could watch again, which is generally not true for a Wolverine movie. Can't believe how Jackman agreed to do this movie.",2013
3,"I've wanted to see a wolverine movie that was fast paced, action packed, with a good storyline that would be well received by critics for the longest time. In my opinion wolverine is by far the most interesting of the x men characters. However this was not the wolverine I was waiting for. Yes it was action packed and I honestly enjoyed the fight scenes, but it was just shocking. This movie was flaw central. It saddens me to know that this was truly Hugh Jackmans last attempt at Wolverine, because we all know he's just too old for another attempt. And no one wants to see him as wolverine fighting off the bad guys at 45, it would be unbecoming. The characters in this story were ridiculous. I could tell from the moment they met that Wolverine was going to get with Mariko, but part of me just would not accept it, up until that fatal night when they kissed. A kiss which lacked any conviction or real passion, it was laughable. The oddest on screen couple I've seen since Matt Damon and Michael Douglas in Behind The Candelabra. They were painfully awkward. The arch villain serpant lady was atrocious. The ostentatious villain that we never even learn why or how she came about to work for Yashida with undiminishing loyalty, or what her general goal was. Yashida himself was a tedious villain and we didn't really here much about his life after Nagasaki. Mariko's father was a perpetual imbecile I could not fathom why he was even mentioned in the movie his character had no real significance. My favourite character had to have been Yuriko at least her motives were clear, Mariko was sort of a sister to her and it was obvious from the outset she wanted a slice of the wolverine pie. Now that couple would have at least been believable because she was bad ass and fearless. Her psychic powers were a bit ridiculous though she didn't really foresee anything worthwhile did she. The fight scenes were enjoyable though especially with the deadly ninja assassins creeping through the night, descending from rooftops and snapping necks like nobody's business. Yuriko was pretty sharp too, I was never really worried for her character, she could hold her own.... she had enough sass. It's a tragedy though I truly believe that Hugh Jackman was the perfect wolverine he just didn't get the movie he deserved. Well my advice is to wait a few years until the stench from this movie clears and then find a 20 year old Hugh Jackman doppelganger and create a Wolverine with some substance. It can't be that hard it has so much potential.",2013
8,"I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.",2016
1,"I was really looking forward to see this movie, and had a feeling it was going to be just as good, or even better than some of the other movies in this genre that has been released lately. I loved Man of Steel, for example. The Wolverine starts off with some really boring sequences, but as a Wolverine/X-Men fan I really thought that soon I was going sit on the edge of my seat. The aggressive Wolverine is about to cut open some hillbilly bear hunters, because they have wounded a bear with a toxic dart. OK, I think, stupid reason to fight, but hey, let's just have fun and watch this piles of dirt get what they deserve from a real superhero! But a female ninja enters the bar, cuts a chair in half, slice the bottom of a beer-bottle with a magnificent sword, and ends it all before something happens for us to see.. So much for the action for the first half of the film. A viper-woman then drains Wolverine for his powers. When he gets his healing powers back(by pulling his own heart out - this is BTW a cool scene!!), he is beaten/sliced to pieces by a normal man who has trained karate! If he didn't have his healing power he would be dead by now. Really disappointing to see one of my favorite superheroes, the Wolverine, who stands up to Hulk in the cartoons, be sliced to pieces by a 50 year old man. So much for fighting skills and super strength..... Involved in this film is a great ninja clan. They forgot to rehearse hiding, so the main ninja unluckily sits on top of the roof where everyone can see him. Well, well. Ninjas can do a lot of other stuff. The movie is just a dull love story for much part. Really boring and stupid. In the final battle the villain in the form of a robot with a man inside(who is not tall enough to see over the robots neck), kick Wolverines ass. Luckily the lead ninja hits the robot with an arrow in the eye, and we can finish this movie off with some really stupid lines, before Wolverine takes off, leaving his woman behind.",2013
9,"First and foremost I must say that I absolutely loved this movie. But as I will cover in my review it may largely be due to the fact that I have always held the source material of this film in very high regard. Having said that, I do recognize that their may be a sliding scale of enjoyability for this film. If you are a fan of the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries of Wolverine then this is the movie you have been waiting for. If you are fond of the character Wolverine and interested into delving deeper into his chronology and exploring his inner conflicts, you will certainly enjoy this movie. If however, you have no familiarity, or no desire to familiarize with the character of Wolverine, you may find yourself not caring about many of the slower moments and longing for a more evenly paced action film.",2013
8,"2009's X-men Origins: Wolverine was received negatively by both critics and the majority of the fans of the character. Now the character has a chance to redeem himself with this year's the Wolverine and for the most part he does. This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of X-men: The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the X-men characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous X-men films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine, although not perfect, is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular.",2013
2,"This is the worst X-men film to date. Many of the earlier films suffer from the rating restriction imposed by the need for a large under-age viewer-ship. They are not gritty, they lack the adult character relationships lack depth, and are too focused on action with minimal blood. This movie seems to have made an attempt to be more ""adult"" by throwing a few curse words in, but fails in the adult movie department for starters because the plot just doesn't make any sense. From the bear scenario at the beginning of the film, things are already looking pretty direction-less, and it does not get better as Logan enters the country of the samurai. The fight scenes are too fast, filmed too closely, poorly sound-tracked (metal on metal sound every time an adamantium claw enters someone's body, a bus, a tree), and not believable. Sometimes Wolverine ""lets"" people get him down just so another ""hero"" can save him, and throughout the film he takes on injuries that a hundreds of years old warrior trained in every martial art should have learned to avoid by now. Fans who have followed Wolverine from comic book to television show to film will wretch at this movie more than the first Wolverine title because it does not portray anything of what makes Logan's story so compelling. How he became what he is, the relationships he has had, the emotional baggage he carries, and not being sure where he stands in the mutant struggle for equality. Logan is an emotionally complex individual, one who has had and lost, seen people be born and grow old and dynasties rise and fall. The movie fails to convey any of this intellectually, showing only a lonely man living in a cave in Alaska with a serious look on his face who immediately falls in love with a girl, fights a bunch of Japanese with no cause themselves for the next hour, and then gets on a plane with another girl. The dream sequences with Jean Grey are extraneous and at the end of the movie Wolverine fights a giant robot that was designed specifically to take his powers by a person who has every reason to be his friend. I am not sure anyone who could review this film positively saw the same movie as me. I want my two hours back.",2013
8,"I actually really like this movie. I applaud them for daring to try something different. There really aren't any other movies quite like this. It definitely draws closely from various movies, but its not like your average superhero movie.",2016
8,"Throughout the course of the modern superhero era, one thing has stayed true: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the ""X-Men"" franchise for three films, Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a cliché-ridden script. Jackman, who has become synonymous with the part in a way that would make even Robert Downey Jr. jealous, deserved better.",2013
8,"This is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This movie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight scenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies lately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine. I thought it was unexpectedly good, with Jackman doing a superb job in the lead role, as a tortured hero, who seems as if he no longer wants to go on living his near immortal existence because of deep regrets and guilt he is feeling about things that happened in the past.",2013
8,"Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 Japanese story arc is one of the most famous and celebrated in comic book history. It has finally been the cinematic treatment, amidst a loose adaptation and watches out the taste of Wolverine's first solo outing.",2013

Logan (Hugh Jackman), the honorable yet brutal warrior of the mutant super team, has grown disenchanted with life and is living in the wilderness of Canada. Haunted by memories of his lost love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the loner is a victim of his own immortality. He has all the time in the world, but nothing left to live for.",2013
8,The Wolverine is the SECOND solo installment for the character and the SIXTH X-Men installment from Fox. The story itself is definitely an improvement to it's predecessors (Except First Class) and teases a larger universe Fox is preparing in order to compete with Marvel Studios.,2013
8,"James Mangold, director of 3:10 to Yuma, presented wolverine as a revival for the long dead x-men franchise. After the devastating display in X-men: Last stand, which was crucified by both fans and critics, for it's blind treatment that even killed it's principle characters, X-men series was struggling to hold on the screen. Two prequels were released, one as an origin story for wolverine and the other depicted the revelry between professor x and magneto. The new wolverine works as a sequel to x3, and tries to lead a path for the series in future. Taking place in Japan, Wolverine deals with the inner struggle of Logan, who grieves about the death of Jean Grey. He questions his eternity as a curse, and wanders around alone. A man, who Logan saved before a long time ago offers him a cure, which will make him mortal. Logan's decisions, and subsequent incidents makes the movie. Hugh Jackman, as usual with his signature role, shines. Supporting cast, including Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima and Will Yun Lee, does justice to their roles. Mangold, with his character-oriented approach, helped the movie to fall out from comic treatment. What lacks in Wolverine is it's explosive nature. The movie emphasize only on Logan. His grieve and his attempts to overcome it. No other characters, except Viper, is mutant here. That made the movie to look like a unique one in the franchise. Also, Wolverine leaves a number of loose ends, like what happened to the other mutants like Storm and Colossus. Let's see next year's X-men days future past answers them all.....",2013
5,"Okay, before I get into it, allow me to highlight some glitches in the movie. First, Wolverine, when in the Japanese prison camp (of which I'm pretty sure there were none in Nagasaki) says something to the effect of 'that's a B-52 bomber. no one's gonna outrun that.' Did he know about the project code named 'Big Boy?' Did he know that it was the atomic bomb? And if so, how the heck would he know that? Also, he slept with his friend's granddaughter. Isn't that against some unwritten code of honor? Also, almost the only factor in the entire movie that moved anybody even a little bit was his relationship with his Japanese friend, and how he sustained an atomic blast to protect him. Then, in the end, we came to find out that he was only looking to take advantage of Wolverine and reclaim his youth. Nicely done. Bonus: there were some funny parts, like in the porno hotel and with the 'doctor.. sort of. veterinarian.. student' and I'll admit, the beginning part with the bear was pretty sad and Wolverine's rage was pretty justified. And the train fight scene was awesome! However, this movie was just like that train, except way too slow paced at times, and it didn't know where it was going. Like, I'm pretty positive the director pulled the ending right out of his butt. Pretty bad. 5/10",2013

8,I went to see this film this morning and found it very enjoyable. I can't really remember the 1st so I can't really compare. ,2013
10,"In all honesty I can't remember the first film that well, so I found it hard to compare to the sequel. On the other hand this film is completely memorable and so enjoyable.",2013
2,"The first film was genius. Everyone loves the bad guys, & there were plenty of them in the first film. Squid gun.. Oh Yeah! But this film not only had no purpose, but it destroyed the personality of ALL the characters. ",2014
10,I saw Despicable Me 2 in the cinema and when i left i did not like it all that much. If i do not take to a film on the first watch then i am unlikely to change my opinion on subsequent views. This film is one of the rare exceptions. I have many 'perhaps' reasons of not liking it the first time from spoilers to mood changes. Well that in neither here nor there. I decided to see it just to pass time after a strenuous day at college followed by work. And i was blown away. Then i saw it again yesterday and it was even better. ,2013
9,"The first Despicable Me was a wonderful film, so while there is the worry of whether a sequel would work you can't help wanting to see it anyway. Despicable Me 2 was just as good as the first one, maybe not as fresh in terms of plot but what worked so well in the first works equally well here. The animation, also having the advantage of staying true to the style and look that the first had, is bursting with vibrancy and colour without looking too over-saturated as well as having a lot of detail to it. The retro-futuristic designs and gadgets are inventive and very striking to look at, while the music has rousing energy and is also memorable. Despicable Me 2 in the writing and gags is peppered with humour, and this is of the laugh-out-loud hilarious kind, though because there's a lot and that you may be laughing so hard you may be at a risk of missing something. To counter-balance the hilarity, the film also incorporates a message, it is a heartfelt one and doesn't feel cloying and out-of-place. For what the story may lack slightly in freshness in correlation with the first, it more than makes up for it in wit, heart, excitement and how briskly it moves without feeling rushed. Having more of the minions- one of the best assets of the first film- was a masterstroke also, and their subplot also gave the story an increasing sense of jeopardy and threat(though theirs is a little more interesting than that of world domination). Gru is a lovable character, whether a villain like in the first or not, and adds a lot of charisma and energy to the film. The top-notch vocal talents of Steve Carrell, Steve Coogan, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt and even Russell Brand are a further advantage. All in all, like the first Despicable Me this sequel is fantastic family fun and equal to it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",2013
9,"I went to the cinema preview with my friend for this movie, and its even better than the first film! I only saw the first film recently, and I really liked it. I wasn't sure I wanted to go and see the film at first, but my mate wanted me to go and see the preview yesterday with him, and reluctantly, I said yes. Usually, the second films aren't better than the first, but boy was I wrong! I was laughing through out the whole film, and so was everyone in the audience, it was full to! Steve Carrell's character, Gru, was hilarious. I think everyone could agree though, the minions were the best characters in the film. My friend told me the directors made up a little language and did the voices, and I was very impressed, for you could hear a hint of English in every word they said. ",2013
10,Really a cute film as it is once again the Minions stealing the movie. As it puts in a sense more of a focus on Gru as a father and the Minions become part of a sinister plot.,2013
8,"It's not often that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film. Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases. From the moment it appears on the screen to the end of the film, Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, fun film that never ceases to be entertaining.",2013
6,i wanted to love it... i really did... i love the first one... told many about it... clearly lots of people saw it after it's theatrical run and are excited for part 2... but i saw it last night and it is a little dull... story is weak... predictable...,2013
6,"I totally fell in love with Despicable Me. It's probably going to be on my list of Ten Best Films, so naturally I awaited with eagerness the premiere of Despicable Me 2. I watched all the trailers, teasers and Mini Movies with Minions - loved them all. Then I watched the film in full 3D.",2013
10,"This movie will honestly have you crying of laughter. It's as if this franchise will only continue to be better and better! With lots of lovely little twists and silly little gags Despicable me 2 will warm your heart and leave you smiling like silly! Definitely something to watch if you're upset, definitely will cheer you up.",2013
6,"I was really looking forward to this film, but to be honest, it wasn't all that amusing. It made me smile a couple of times, but no real chuckles. The story was a little messy. Gru wasn't as convincing. Neither were his interactions with some of the new characters. Pure good doesn't suit him very well. The minions weren't as funny - in fact, they were a little annoying - and the villain's master plan was rubbish. ",2013
10,"The sudden torrential showers had me thinking do I really have to go for the movie, but thank god I did! One and half hours of laughter made it worthwhile for braving the rain. From the word go, you start laughing and till the movie ends (and it gets only better during credits). There is no special intro to Gru this time but his 'Angel' costume really sets the tone. Agnes is cuter than ever and watching her run like the unicorn makes you smile (atmosphere gets better if you have kids in your theater, I had quite a few and makes you laugh when they imitate Agnes!). Margo is growing up and Edith is just the same. Gru is also looking out for a date all through the film, not knowing he has one right next to him, Lucy. She is the Agent from AVL (Anti Villain League) and her first job is the way she brings in Gru. (Lipstick taaaser!!!). And then there are the Minions. They actually are the focus of this film. You get a load of them throughout the film but you never notice. Every single one of their scenes make you laugh so hard that at one point I couldn't stop!!!(Minion Fire Brigade!!) And then there is El Macho and his son(and his chicken!) who give the twists in the end. You wont miss out Dr.Nefario who seems to leave Gru and plot the crime but helps save the world in the end. So the final verdict: if you want to have 90 mins of real hard laughter, you can close your eyes and go for it!",2013
9,"So Despicable Me 2 is a very family funny/friendly animated comedy which at points really does make you laugh! If you are reading this now and haven't yet seen the trailer, I would recommend you don't watch the trailer and just go straight to the film, Some of the best parts are shown in the trailer. To watch this film you don't really need to have seen the first however I would recommend you do as at points the film refers to Despicable Me (1).",2013

10,"This was better than the 1st film which I saw and enjoyed. This is fast paced and funny because I laughed throughout. There are loads of potentially funny situations and they exploited them all instead of the disappointment of not taking things that little bit further. I'll be seeing it again and again as there is so much to catch the 2nd and 3rd time around too. The new characters, bad guy and gal spy, the spicy Latin flavor all enhance the storyline and enjoyment of the film. Minions are all throughout the film so if you wanted more you got more. I saw the 2D version which was brilliant. 3D would be quite a ride with all the action scenes. Check it out !!!",2013
8,"Despicable Me 2 is a brilliant film with a great storyline and an impressive voice cast.I definitely wouldn't say it was better than the first Despicable Me,the first one was a lot more heartwarming,but it still is a very good sequel and has everything you want in a family film,humor for both young and older audiences.However,the story of the movie feels very scattered and throughout I felt like they were trying to fit too much in one hour and a half.Like the first Despicable Me,the Minions are the best part,and they get even more screen time in this one that they did previously,it's almost impossible not to laugh at these goofy and lovable characters.It's not as good as the first Despicable Me,but this sequel is very funny and an enjoyable movie for the whole family and I look forward to seeing what Illumination Entertainment does with these characters in the future.",2013
8,"""Despicable Me 2"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the lovable ""Despicable Me"". It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. There were also the three little girls that have the movie heart (Margo, Edith, and Agnes). ",2013
2,"CAREFUL! I went to the cinema yesterday to watch this movie because I liked the first part and because I trusted in the good rating here on IMDb which was a mistake. Maybe you like Despicable Me 2, but if you are looking for a movie like Despiceable Me 1, I want you to know that THIS MOVIE IS NOT COMPARABLE TO ITS PREDECESSOR. I liked the predecessors extraordinary and impressible sense of humor - which has become damn silly in part 2. I also liked the story and its message in part 1 - which has become ordinary and cheesy in part 2. Sad that they did not put half the effort and love into this movie compared to Despicable Me 1.",2013

3,"i watched the first movie a lot of times, i must admit it was by accident cause there wasn't anything good on TV, but i loved it, the villain, the minions and the plot, so i expected way more from this movie. In the first one the minions were used as sidekicks they had their funny moments but weren't like really part of the plot, which was okay cause they were the ingredient for the comedy and were used very well.. in the second one they are way way overused.. they put minions every five minutes and the jokes and even their language aren't as funny as the first.. it feels like ""they tried too hard"".. the villain was the stupid ""i wanna rule the world"" overused motive.. vector was 100 times better... i'm not saying was bad but was just a movie i wouldn't watch again... the first one i could watch over and over.. Btw i'm sorry if i don't make much sense.. my English is very limited",2013
4,This movie might be worth the rental and then it is just something to toss at your kids about 6 to 8 years old. The first movie was hit with both young and old but this movie is just cliché filled with tropes and idioms. Unlike the first story this one lacks humor.,2013
10,"Fast & Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast & Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.",2015
8,"I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.",2013
8,"Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and ""The Rock"" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick.",2013
9,I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!,2013
5,"This will contain MAJOR spoilers, so readers beware. Fast and Furious 6 just went off its rails, scrap that - it completely flew off its rails. This film turned utterly ridiculous to the point where I am left thinking ""why?"" There was no need for the film to pan out how it did. The first part (and I should point out) main bulk of the film was enjoyable, trying to track down Letty whilst working alongside the very man trying to stop them previously (Hobbs) offered something new and interesting and it made for some interesting moments. This part of the film I felt was good, even if they did practically ignore the car side of things. It's like they tried to force some stuff in there about the cars but then they never even showed what the cars actually where, or anything about the flipper car which was actually quite interesting. The first car sequence in the film they all used BMW 5 series? (This is major spoilers from now on) Why, if Riley is Shaw's girlfriend would she be ordered practically to her death throughout the whole film? There was a whole massive fight scene with Letty and herself, surely if they was working together that fight just didn't need to happen since no one was even there but those two see it. So they just had a fight for no reason. Why would Riley chase Letty so vigilantly? She could have let her get away without getting herself thrown down some concrete stairs. They forced this twist in the film for some reason. Then for the main car chase in the film / action sequence, Shaw's team capture a ""convoy"" which is just a truck and two jeeps. I can't fathom how stupid this actually is because not only does this tiny convoy have a hugely powered tank inside, it also has the chip worth ""billions"" and is a danger to everyone etc. Yet this convoy, of MILITARY personnel is incapable of protecting this vital piece of equipment. Men trained in warfare are treated like pawns which the criminals just shrug off with ease. Did I mention the military was aware Shaw's team was there, Shaw's team notorious for their driving ability and capture of convoys and yet this tank and lorry are just casually driving along with what may as well be no protection at all? Why? Why didn't they make the convoy seem stronger and actually include some intelligent action here for the capture of the tank? Then they actually capture this tank and Shaw's team are now military experts who know exactly how to control this tank. They needlessly kill dozens of innocent people by crushing them to death and no one even seems fazed by it. Now if a tank was captured in this way, who would come in to stop it? Not Dom and Brian. The rest of military would. Utterly ridiculous but I accept that is how the film works so I don't hold that against the film too much - that is just your typical mindless action movie stuff. It would have been much more interesting if the military got involved alongside the team though. Then it happens. The corniest moment I have ever seen in any film ever. Letty is catapulted over the edge of a huge bridge; she is flying through the air to her certain death. But wait! Dom then catapults himself from the other side of the bridge (there is a gap in the middle) catches her in mid air and lands perfectly onto a car to break their fall. Why does this scene have to exist? It's awful, from this moment on the film goes rubbish. This moment, is where I think the director/producer/writer went on holiday and no longer cared.",2013
7,"While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.",2013
2,"I walked into the cinema expecting to write something about this being the must see film for the weekend, remembering the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequels (except for that abortion Tokyo Drift we'd all like to forget we saw) and the redeeming previous installment Fast Five that somehow redeemed and reinvented the franchise introducing 'The Rock' as a kick-ass anti-hero and started the franchise on a remarkably cool path with fast paced action that was grounded with a great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief.",2013
8,"Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.",2013
5,"This movie started off really well, however, it was set off course after the action started. I have to warn those that watched the trailers on television, because they spoiled every exciting scene from the movie. I would not consider myself an avid fan, but I have followed the series ever since the first movie and I would be the first one to tell you that this movie is a major disappointment. After Tokyo drift, the director relied heavily on action and random fillers to please the audience while leaving the fans frustrated and confused. And since when did the acronym ""F&F"" turn from fast and furious to fast and fighting? This series has started it's roots from racing and formed into another predictable action movie.",2013
8,"From the first frame of Fast and Furious 6 we realize that this is not really about a movie about heist and car chases (well okay it has this); no this is a movie about the depths you will go and the willingness to do whatever you can to protect family. Leaving off where Fast five left off, most of the characters are off on there, whether it be hanging in Tokyo, flying pretty ladies to manacu to making people feel low about there rough life to a new baby being born, the crew is in hiding and living the life abroad. It's at the point that the plot ramps up and we get a Dom Terretto going after a would be thief Owen Shaw ( a new type of villain) and trying to save the somehow resurrected Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who has joined Shaw in his wanting to take over the world. Bring most people back from the Fast Five and you got yourself a movie. This movie isn't what I call the most coherent, it has issues and Owen Shaw's character is kind of one note, but this isn't the type of movie that you need to worry about great story. It's the type of movie that you go to watch and have fun , and watch the unbelievable happen. Everyone In this movie looks like there comfortable being there and seem to be having fun. It's what I would call an audience movie, the type of movie that feels In sync enough that everyone's on board There are plenty of laughs thanks to Tyrese and plenty of drama thanks to Toretto and Brian's relationship and history in the series. They pull together to do the subject justice. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie does lead up to a point that all the films finally have a connecting tissue and what you thought you knew with the bonus scene at the end will lead into an interesting 7th film. Lets just hope James Wan doesn't ruin the good will this series has gained.",2013

Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out.

I was actually excited to see this movie and believe me when I say, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I'm an action movie junkie, and this film had plenty of it. I've been enjoying the F&F transformation from being a movie about illegal street racing and stealing car parts, to heists, drug lords, undercover agents, the cartel and now, even terrorism. ",2013
3,"We all know the Fast and Furious 6 franchise has become less and less about the cars over the series, so there is no point in moaning about that now. As an action packed film, and the occasional race which forcefully became relevant to the story, Fast and Furious 6 is great. However, the realism of this film was just dreadful, Star Wars was more believable when Yoda came back as a ghost. I noticed three loopholes in the story myself, that's while my friend sat next to me tapping me on the shoulder every 10 seconds to point out another cliché. If you have seen the other films in this series then you can pretty much work out for yourselves what is going to happen. Growing up with this series I really wanted to leave a good review, but I just can't. Overall, if you enjoyed the other films, just want an action packed film and can leave your brain at the door then this movie is great. But it will leave the more hardcore film fan laughing at how they could write and direct a better film in their sleep.",2013
8,"Initially i was a lil skeptical about watching this one. No matter how strong the cast of this is and especially all the previous racers and characters coming together, it was a SEQUEL and usually they are disappointing. But this one i bet is one of the best sequels ever.. Keeps up to the name it definitely is fast, almost throughout there is no dull moment and you just can't afford to even blink your eye! Justin lin has sketched each character so magnificently, that you just can't avoid it. Great storyline and full of past paced action, Lin keeps you guessing in this one. The action sequences look for real and impressive. Though all the previous stars are back in this one, every single one of them has an important role to play, and every single one of them looks good. But YET they all look ohh so fresh.. The background score keeps you alive, and execution spellbound. Especially the 1st introduction seen of Shaw and the car chase on Spanish highway.. But the showstopper is the finale, the climax on the military base. Every actor has looked impressive, Vin diesel is impressive love struck leader out to save his girl, Dwayne Johnson as high on muscle supercop (resembles the role of Roadblock from GI Joe), Tyrese impresses with his comic timing and paul walker is good.. Sung kang and Ludicrous are great too in the performances, but What impresses me most are Michelle Rodriguez and Luke evans as the ultimate antagonist. He looks stylish amazing and absolutely classy in his role. Probably the best he has looked so far. Overall, the movie keeps you stuck on the seat, and yes there is a bit of a surprise element by the end of this one and i am sure you would be waiting for the next installment after that.. So make sure you do watch till the closing numbers start!!! Fast was this and made surely someone else furious for 7!!",2013
8,"I have always loved action movies, especially those which involve fast cars, explosions, preposterous plans and daring execution. Fast and the Furious Franchise gave me everything and more!! Vin Diesel is awesome for his role as Dom. For me the movie was great in all respects except one.",2013
8,"I almost laugh at commenters who give this movie 1 Star. One person referred to people as ""morons"", one said that having a seemingly dead character dead wasn't original, and another didn't even see 3,4,5. Went to go see the movie last night and it seemed to be much better than 5 in my opinion.",2013
8,"A typical fast and furious movie loaded with machine guns,cars,muscular men,chicks,..etc...so far this is the best fast and furious movie,..very fast,enjoyable with terrific and exhaustible action sequences,..fast and furious fans should watch it,..and i recommend for others too,..actually highly recommended... it promises u for the 7th part in the end which ends up in Tokyo,,.. the next thing i wont tell,..because i don't want to spoil u'r movie. The movie keeps u entertained with a very fast moving plot,...jay z and ludicrous's songs,.. FURIOUS 6 is a pure action adrenal type movie,..and a must watch,..GO FOR IT...don't miss this one",2013
10,I want this movie to come out on DVD now so I can watch all the movies in the right order :P. I also love how people clapped when they thought Vin died. I was like have you not seen Tokyo drift? I also like how they connected this film to Tokyo drift. I finally get the back story on it. I loved this movie and am looking forward to them making more. I am also glad they brought in Statham. I was wondering why Vin came to Tokyo but now I know. All the connections in this film were done very well. It was good to see the full team back together again and them come back home where they belong. I am interested in seeing how Statham's role is for this movie if he plays the same type he does in his other movies.,2013
7,"Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.",2013
2,1) You care about the laws of physics 2) You actually want to see illegal street races 3) You are over 12 4) You know something about cars (and planes... and tanks) 5) You expect movies to have a script 6) You think the memory loss Tom & Jerry plot is too old 7) You want jokes to be funny 8) You want to see good acting 9) You want to see Jason Statham,2013
10,"For motor-heads, the Fast and Furious franchise is pure sin, the sins getting bigger and badder with every sequel. But the franchise is more than just car flicks. They have established an instant connection with today's youth culture gorged in hip hop, street cred and video game violence, spanning continents. While many thought that the previous installment Fast Five was the very pinnacle the series could aim for, out comes Fast and Furious 6, breaking all previous boundaries, and shattering myths that a 6th installment cannot be creative, and is one too many. Before we talk of the movie though, let us take a moment to absorb the legend of the sullen hero- Vin Diesel.",2013
9,"Just watched it in France, gonna admit it is just explosive and best action movie so far this year: Well balanced timing, good fight featuring Rodriguez, a great tag team tornado match for the grand finally. Don't even think about story line because this kind of movie can make you believe anything as long as punchlines from each characters, punches from the main ones, put a step further to the never seen before one of a kind car chasing (e.g tank vs old cars / aircraft vs muscle cars) You have to remember a wrestlemania like match feat. Rock/Diesel which is as good as Superman/Batman fighting together. Over the top : ending preparing the Fast and Furious team Vs The Transporter : 2014 great year upcoming...",2013
8,Nice opening title by the way...,2013
9,"I love this movie! Furious 6 is even bigger and more over-the-top than Fast Five, which I also loved! That vault-dragging scene was a blast but this new sequel is even more epic and maddeningly entertaining! This time, Hobbs and new sidekick Riley, played by Gina Carano, team with Dom, Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej to take down Owen Shaw and his crew. If they succeed, Dom and Co. receive full pardons and the chance to make their family whole again as Letty is in fact alive and working with Owen Shaw.",2013
7,"I implore anybody that has seen this movie once, and not liked it, to watch it once more. This time, however, take into account that film is a visual medium. Instead of expecting a narrator or a character to easily explain to you what is happening try paying attention to what is happening. Examine and truly THINK about what is expressed visually. The brilliant part about Under The Skin is how well it tells a story without dialog, without running commentary, and without the central character saying much at all.",2015
7,"I am surprised by the amount of negative criticism about this film as I found it mesmerising and intriguing. If your expecting some Hollywood movie about a sexy alien killing lots of dull characters in a gory and sensationalised way (with lots of explosions thrown in), then you will be disappointed. The pace is slow however I felt that this contributed to the whole feel and atmosphere. I liked the use of Scotland as a setting especially the way it contrasted the natural beauty of Scotland with some of the urban ugliness that exists. I also liked the way Scarlett Johansson played the main role - cool, sexy and almost emotionless. I am glad I didn't watch this at the cinema as watching it at home meant I could discuss the film during the many periods of calm. There were a few arty scenes in the film but I did not feel these were pretentious or contrived, again they added to the feel of the film. The ending was a little disappointing in my opinion but I still feel this film is classy, original and will make most people think!",2014
10,"Did any of the 100+ 'one star' 'worst film ever' reviewers see the trailer for 'Under the Skin'? If they had, they would have known exactly what they were in for. I'm just guessing that the prospect of seeing Scarlett Johansson naked had many of them them throw caution into the wind. And then they felt cheated. Serves them right.",2014
9,"I don't usually write reviews, this is more a reply to the negative comments - because I'm a contentious little man. ",2014
1,"At the end of this film someone shouted out ""What a load of old pony"" and a cheer went up from a fair proportion of the audience - that part that either hadn't left before the end or hadn't fallen asleep. To continue the metaphor then this film is up there with the old nag that Steptoe and Son keep in their back yard.",2014
10,"I have to admit that I did not see the first minutes of the film. Neither have I read the book therefore I will write about this film as if it was a piece of art on its own, which it is.",2013
4,"I would like to start by saying i am a fan of films that are ""different"". I don't need a million gunshots or explosions to entertain me. I am not set on good guy vs bad guy and good guy winning. I like thought provoking films; i enjoy them much more than the soul sucking films that are manufactured on a daily basis. So i was intrigued by this one. The trailer was dark and seemed full of suspense. The critics had made bold comparisons with Stanley Kubrick, which in itself is a massive compliment. And as someone who lives in Scotland it had a little sentiment to it. ",2014
5,"About 5 years ago I read the book by Michael Faber. In the book, a strange looking woman with big boobs picks up Scottish hitchhikers, ascertains if they're alone in the world; if they are, she takes them to a secret place where they are anesthetized, then castrated and de- tongued. They are then fattened to be used for food in the place she comes from, an unnamed planet. She has had her face altered to look human by removing her snout. She feels very ugly because of this. At one point a male she was in love with comes to visit the secret place and she feels terrible because of her ""deformity"", realizing that now he will never love her. At one point in the book she is almost raped by a very crude man, and blinds him with her nails. ",2014

10,Oh the sweet anger of the morons who stumbled into this looking for another vacuous blockbuster. Finally some revenge for all the promising sci-fi films lately we've been duped into hoping would be something interesting.,2014
1,"OK, so we sat through the entire film. We left after the credits rolled and looked at each other with the ""WTF was that!"" look. Some observations: 1. Scarlett had one facial expression throughout the whole film 2. Those who compare it to the works of Stanley Kubrick have obviously not seen a Stanley Kubrick film 3. The soundtrack was annoying which I would contribute to the director having made too many music videos 4. Too many holes in the script to mention here 5. Who were the guys on the motorcycle and how come they did not need to ""feed"" ? 6. The reviews I had read mentioned that it used ground breaking techniques in camera placement (in the van), Have these guys seen any episodes of COPS? That is inventive camera placement! 7. And what was she thinking when she signed on to do this film???",2014
1,Overall a boring film in which nothing really happens - I feel Scarlett must've just done this for a few spare quid as she is barely recognisable compared to the magic she puts into Captain America. Picture it paints of Scotland makes me wish they do vote yes for independence to get rid of such depressing places. As for the music? Enough to send an insomniac to sleep. The story - what there is of it - offers no explanations or outcomes of the victims or what she is doing what she is doing and the dialogue almost non existent. There were only 15 people in the screening on a Saturday night when I watched this - only five were left at the end I wish I hadn't been one of them,2014
10,"Whenever you have a groundbreaking film that redefines Form, you are going to have some that either love it or hate it. Having said that, as I get older I more often find reading the user comments on IMDb fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss Under The Skin as ""boring"" they must have no interest in human consciousness, science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.",2014
4,"The problem with movies like this is that you have the people who hate slow, mysterious movies and it's automatically 1 star because there were no car chases or dubstep, and the people that feel they have to defend anything quiet and ambiguous like this and give 9 or 10 stars.

2,"Reading the majority of reviews regarding this film, and fully trusting the 7.4 IMDb user rating I went to the movies and watched this film. This is a decision I'll regret for the rest of my life. I found this film to be incredibly dull and pointless. Its plot is far from original and I left the room feeling as though these were 108 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Too many plot-holes to mention, way too many slow parts. I guess that the only things that lead me to give it a 2/10 instead of a 1/10 were the photography of the film and Scarlet's performance. I am extremely confused and amazed by the generally positive reaction to this piece of nonsense.",2014

1,"Haven't seen a worse movie in years. A lot of people say that plot ideas were left out so that the viewer could make their own theories about it, and I love when a movie does that. This is not one of those movies, main plot points weren't just left out, there isn't any. An hour and forty minutes of Scarlett Johanson getting naked, seducing guys, and killing them in some weird vortex pool inside a house. And... that's the whole movie, I wish I was joking about that but I'm not.",2014

I think most people were sleeping or playing with their mobile phone. 2.Nothing really Happens in this movie!!! I mean it! Really nothing. If you watch this movie, you may give it a little time before you judge it. You may say ""ok i am gonna wait a few minutes. It may become better"" But it wont! 3. The music is awful. And in comparison with the boring scenario its something you won't be able to stand! 4. Maybe the worst movie of Scarlet! Concluding, It needs only 10 minutes to realize that this movie is a crap!

There is no real story, no character development, no feeling at all in this movie. It's a few things that happen, very slowly, as you watch. Several people in the theatre I was in left, presumably due to boredom. Here is my recommendation of what to do instead of watching this movie.",2014
10,"If you go through all the negative reviews for this film, one thing is abundantly clear; the people who dislike it have no clue what the story is, didn't pay good attention, and are otherwise generally misinformed about the plot and what is actually happening in the film. This movie needs to have some ever so slight prior investigation before viewing for you to fully appreciate it. Some people in the reviews were clearly not even aware that Scarlett Johansson was indeed an alien. To view this movie without having any prior knowledge of basic plot or without having read the book is similar to watching Prometheus without first having seen Alien, its a shallow experience compared to the one you should be receiving. ",2014
3,"I was waiting for this film and i waited for nothing. Crap. I think that we should create a new category/genre of films - like ""pretensious art movies"" or something like that, so that this one and movies like: ""tree of life"" could have its right expression. The movie never ended. The only thing that made me see it through the end was scarlet. Hopping she would take her clothes off one more time. And she did! These were the only highs of the movie. The lows were deplorable.No communication. Too slow. Stupid motorcycle staff support. And the scene where she tries to eat some cake...Christ! it took almost a hole minute just to move her arm up to her mouth. This is art, right? OK...if you say so! And the end?! oh! my god! I miss movies like: ""close encounters"" or ""batteries not included"", ""E.T."", or even ""Paul"" or ""Mars attack"". This is a total disappointment. The critics must be crazy, that's all i can say.",2014
5,After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new sci-fi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.,2013
5,"What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.",2013
1,"This movie was such a colossal failure on so many levels. I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this monstrosity was so atrocious that I felt compelled to warn unsuspecting potential viewers of the steaming pile of sewage that is referred to as ""Elysium"".",2013
5,"I think the director, Neill Blomkamp, must have blackmailed them into it. Or maybe he held their dogs hostage? Because, if they read the script, they had to have known that all the special-effects in the world wouldn't save it.",2014

Is Elysium on par with Oscar nominated District 9? Absolutely NOT! Not even close but it is still a solid sci/fi entertainment. It is a more conventional film than its predecessor, which I was not expecting from Blomkamp.",2013
4,"So bad. They don't make you care about ANY of the characters and the storytelling is awful. You barely get to see Elysium, it's just like 3 guys in sweaters in a country club drinking champagne for like 5 seconds, and there's a little bit of grass and a few trees. Like really? That didn't even look that cool. **Spoiler I guess** Matt Damon is dying the whole movie from some exposure to radiation, and that is the only reason he is trying to go to Elysium. They should have at least made that little girl his secret daughter or something, so that you could actually care about him saving her. Her mongoose and hippo story was painful to watch, even thought it was the only time Matt Damon and the little girl actually interacted. Kruger (the main villain) was okay I guess. He had a cool accent and beard, but he wasn't that tough or threatening though.",2013
7,"I tend to be curious every time a talented filmmaker gets to direct a film set in a pessimistic future/post-apocalyptic era : visually, it's the perfect setting for desolated landscapes and amazing images of urban chaos ; story-wise, it's the perfect occasion to insert social commentary and establish more or less subtle metaphors about our current way of life, our current values, and extend in a fictitious way many assumptions that we have regarding the fate of mankind and our very own planet. ",2013
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's previous film, ""District Nine"". That film succeeded because of its well-written, interesting characters, uniquely lived-in futuristic setting, and, most importantly, its emotional core. Unfortunately, Blomkamp's newest project has fallen far short of my expectations. ""Elysium"" is utterly dull. In spite of an aesthetic that almost exactly mirrors that of ""District Nine"", ""Elysium"" lacks the characters or attention to plot details that would have made the movie work. Instead, it falls flat in almost every way. ",2013

5,"I read reviews that claimed Elysium was thought provoking. It did generate a lot of questions, one of which was what the Afrikaaners with their grossly thick accents were saying. Yes, Afrikaaners. I haven't seen this many villainous Apartheid goons since Lethal Weapon 2. The villains aren't explicitly identified as being from any country because countries have been replaced by classes, but the accents of Delacort and the band of murderous mercenaries sound Afrikanner to me. Elysium is presided over by an Indian, inhabited by Caucasions, protected by white supremacists who seem to be Africa's sole representation. That leave Hispanics back on Earth. The Earth-side scenes are set in a futuristic Los Angeles that looks a lot like a Mexico City slum. The only Anglos in sight are the evil industrialist and his taskmasters...and Matt Damon. With characters painted with such a broad brush, why wasn't the protagonist' part filled by a Latino? The re-emergence of Afrikaaners as villains puzzled me until I realized that the director/writer is South African. I guess everyone has his favorite group of villains. Blomkamp's villains also include the wealthy. His heavy-handed portrayals of rich Caucasions turns everyone in this film into a caricature. I'm reminded of Rand's We the Living where rich capitalists not only oppress the people, they run over someone's puppy too. The heavy-handed absence of subtlety is typical of philosophical works. I guess that makes Elysium more of a philosophical statement than science fiction. This is a criticism of Rand's seminal work Atlas Shrugged, and it holds true for more leftward leaning dogma too. Everything is good or bad. People are evil rich or sanctified poor. The rich seem to have the resources to cast crumbs to the poor, but they won't because don't want to. The film makers turned Elysium is liberal tripe, even throwing in a quick anti-gun remark just before using those guns to fight back against their tyrannical yoke.",2013
8,"Before watching Elysium, I read every review about it. And it seems to me that there are a lot of people that hated it. Most have said that the message in the film is what kept it 'likable'.

Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 ""alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships,"" Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.",2013
1,"This movie is a serious competitor with After Earth for worst sci-fi movie of 2013. While After Earth was the result of wealthy Will Smith's nepotism, the question of why Elysium ever came to be is more of a mystery. The longer you watch this movie, the more you forget about the ridiculous fantastical story, and will just see wealthy actors boring you. The contrasting uber-polarization between rich and poor was made to be so obvious, particularly with the rich having a machine that instantly fixes any health issue - and somehow the poor run a space program - that it is simply childish and unbelievable. The director obviously had dough for proved talent Matt Damon and plenty of special effects, but it just doesn't add up to anything. The villain is an absolute annoying joke - and I guess villains are to be hated - but maybe not for the reasons I did, which was: ""Why can't I take this guy seriously?"" and ""I hate the sound of this guy's voice"". And unfortunately the villain isn't the only annoying thing about this movie: the entire thing is torture comparable to a steaming pile of poo held under your nose for over an hour. The movie can't end soon enough, and the director and all actors involved should be punished severely for unleashing this abomination unto the world.",2013
1,"Just what exactly do you expect when you go to see a good Sci-fi movie? Great visuals? Computer effects? Sure, they add a lot to a movie, but they are not part of its' ""soul"". However, all that big studios do these days is target the 90% of the population and sell crappy plot wrapped in special effects and good reliable clichés (like the ""hero fighting the main villain at the end of the movie"" scene). But hey, why not? That's what makes money. Because 90% of the population - those people who actually think this was a good movie, those who are responsible for the tabloid press being the most popular media - those will LOVE this movie. It's about them. About poor uneducated people who overpopulated the Earth and practically destroyed it. They are willing to overlook the laughable plot holes like the one where Foster talks to the Carlyle character. She asks him if he can reboot the system of Elysium and make her a president. And the answer? Of course I can! - Really? Really?! Just like that? Well why didn't you do it earlier than and make yourself a president instead of begging her for new contracts? I agree with other reviews that talk about the weak plot, shallow characters and poor acting. However, there is one more thing to point out: What is the message of this movie? That we are all equal? Cuz the way I see it, our hero makes everyone on the Earth a legal citizen of Elysium, so that everyone can be cured and they can all thrive under the sun, without any diseases and health problems, and continue to overpopulate the Earth as before, making it even more miserable a place to live. Lets make more cute children and don't think about the consequences. Natural selection people!!!",2013
1,"The only creative aspect of this film is its plot holes. I can ignore some implausibility with science fiction, but this one went too far. It didn't help that I've seen far too many futuristic elitist dystopias in the past several years and that even the best actors in this film seemed to be struggling through to their paychecks. Like Hunger Games and Upside Down, it featured a future society in which the poor are sacrificed or exploited to benefit a small group of elites, but the satellite where all the privileged live, on not too close inspection, doesn't seem even large enough to contain much more than the control centers and political offices that show in the film. It also features a scrappy hero who's been in trouble but now just wants to get by, but it's hard to sympathize with his purely self-centered reasons for fighting the system; he only wants to cure himself of radiation poisoning. He does sacrifice himself at the end, so there is a type of redemption, but it really doesn't make sense that the solution to looming oppression is to program the computers to stop being bigots, at which point, the elite all have to be nice because they only do what the computers tell them to do. I guess the writer(s) didn't study what happened to African Americans in the US after the emancipation proclamation: it was not all peaches and cream just because the white establishment called them citizens. Some of the film looked great, but I was too busy, rolling my eyes at every single movement of the plot, to notice it. District 9 was an interesting and innovative film. Elysium is, in every way that matters, exactly the opposite.",2014

3,"They did a fantastic job on effects, particularly the rebuilding of a face, and bodies breaking apart. The characters and storyline were collateral damage. OK, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster cannot be brought back to life?? The villain was brought back to life after being dead two hours and half his head cut off! Stupid. I wanted to see more of Elysium. Isn't that why you go to the movies? To escape and be wowed and be privy to a fantasy world?? There was NONE of that. You literally see as much of Elysium as is shown in the trailer. About three quick scenes. No characters are developed on Elysium. There could have been so much fun to show life and technology and decadence, but the characters don't even do their fight scenes in the fancy houses, they fight in a factory setting! Guess it saved a lot of money on sets! The jittery hand-held camera work was bad. No need to edit the scenes since they are blurry and choppy and you can't see what is going on anyway. Matt Damon, a kick ass actor who was given nothing. I could care less if he ends up with his leading woman. No real moments, just clichés and they had absolutely NO chemistry. She lives in a dump with her daughter and no husband, and when hunky Matt Damon asks her out she says NO?? WTF? It sucked and then she tells him her daughter is dying and he walks out the door. (Except for a cheesy scene which was like a Hallmark moment.) BTW all the cute little girls on Earth were dying of a disease that could only be cured on Elysium. The kids were too cutesy and did not have real personalities. Another complaint is that I truly did NOT want the people of earth to get to Elysium. They were unlikeable. Why is it that they were portrayed as filthy and greasy?? I know plenty of people without money who are nice and clean and neat as a pin. They were criminals and just plain gross. They cannot brush their hair? Matt Damon is the only one who works in his neighborhood? It was like the filmmakers were bigots toward impoverished people to portray them that way. Oh yeah, and Matt is exposed to a full dose of radiation at the start of the film, and THEN he saves the world? I'm sorry, make him have liver failure or cancer or an infection. DO NOT give him acute radiation poisoning and expect us to believe he can carry on, have major surgery, recover and save the world. Duh. And BTW, why would all these criminals let him even come near them when he is contaminated? I also think they should have made the earthlings surgery much cleaner. It was stupid to believe Matt could recover from surgery in that filthy chop shop. His apparatus bolted into his body was ridiculous. It was like two tire pumps screwed into him. The chop shop was another reason to dislike the earthlings. Organization does not cost anything. They could be organized and have lights in their surgery. They have a huge war room with technology so why no lights? They had water, and I'm sorry, if you are sitting around all day with no day job, you can learn how to make your own soap! Jodie Foster did what she could. I wanted to see more of her party, her house, her life. Would have been so cool to have Matt Damon sneak up there and have an affair with her or something. Now that would have been a good story. Jodie looks absolutely beautiful. Villain was super annoying. He was like spitting out one-liners constantly and I hated him because he was annoying, not scary. Another thing they did was make all the houses the criminals (earthlings) broke into empty. No one was ever in the Elysium houses. Why? Because you did not want to write dialog? Maybe there would be a nice family who would help. It would have been so much more satisfying. It was just so lacking in any personality, I feel bad because I think they must have had a limited budget or something, so no time spent on the story or scenes of Elysium. It could have been great, so it was a lost opportunity.",2013
7,"'Elysium' starring Matt Damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie. It has everything you would want in a movie; a great cast that serves their purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the team an Oscar. Everything including all the fight scenes were executed flawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The writing was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere. Overall 'Elysium' is worth every penny to watch in theater.",2013
8,"Why are writers and other creative types fond of portraying dystopic societies? (Bladerunner; I Robot; The Hunger Games; The Lord of the Rings trilogy; the Terminator series; the Matrix trilogy; The Omega Man and its remake, I am Legend; even the star Wars franchise; Elysium; the list goes on.) Maybe because we live in one.",2013
1,"I laughed at the box that says ""Spoiler Alert"" you couldn't spoil this it it that bad. Plenty of action but that is only camouflage to disguise the very predictable plots, all used in previous films over the years.. and as for the acting I can't describe how bad it was. There's a line in it where the Elysium Secretary Of State (Jodie Foster) says "" I'm afraid I can't Act"".... I fell off the chair laughing. 106 minutes of your life that you'll never get back.I'd rather be in the dentist's chair for that long. I'll bet it didn't take that long to write. How did Matt Damon agree to do this. I give it 1/10... my previous low score was 6/10... and that was dreadful. And as for the false accents.. reminded me of a cross between Mad Max and Mary Poppins.",2014
10,"What captured me to Steven Universe was definitely the unique art styling and amazing video game-like music. I watched the first episode not knowing what to expect, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It had an innocent, down to earth feeling that made me recall the happiness of my childhood and the struggles of learning my own talents. After that, I got hooked on everything, from all the characters to the grade A puns! ",2014
10,"When I first saw the commercial for this show I thought it was going to be something completely rotten. However, I was surprisingly proved wrong after falling in love with the witty characters and exceptional storyline. The animation is spot-on, voice actors are phenomenal, and the theme song is actually very catchy. There is a deep connection you feel with the ""crystal gems"" and I hope in the future they reveal more about their backgrounds as the series progresses. There are many morals and truths in story, like the quote that Steven always says ""If every pork chop was perfect, we wouldn't have any hot dogs!"" It's very true since if everyone was perfect, there would be no one special. It's great and so far I can't find anything wrong with it.",2014
9,"The author ""natebridgeman"" evidently don't know what he's/she is talking about.These Character designs are very sharp and original,the gems are based on actual gems and their skin color match.I actually miss shows with sharp geometric figures and I'm glad Rebecca Sugar brought this to her show,and ironically the show was nominated for a Annie awards for it's completely original character designs (A great accomplishment).",2014
10,"Let's start with the visuals. The backgrounds are simple yet beautiful and unique. The animation is fluid and the character's expressions are always on the dot and emotional or comical when need be for either. The characters' designs and color palettes are pretty and fitting for each individual. Using that as a segue, I'd like to talk about the characters. The characters develop well over time, adding to the plot of the show. Since the characters are pretty realistic compared to other television programs, the likablility of a character depends on who is judging. For example, Steven Universe is not the brightest kid, and his excitement can be a bit much to handle, but he has moments where he can calm down and empathize with people. Some viewers love him, some viewers hate him; it depends on the viewer. Also, when a certain character has a sudden outburst when remembering a lost loved one, the viewers can feel pity for the character, but also see the nitty- gritty selfishness and jealousy come out of said character. For some, this is an accurate reaction for trying to cope with the lost for a loved one. The background music fits perfectly for the mood; whether it be sad, emotional scenes such as what was previously mentioned, the funny and peaceful scenes, or the exciting battle scenes. The songs that the characters sing, which isn't that often for those of you aren't into that, are cute and well-written. One of my favorite parts of this show is the story and lore. Since the show, for the most part, is seen from Steven's perspective, we learn more as the show goes on. We learn about why the Crystal Gems are there in the first place, and more of what they are. It's hard to explain without spoiling too much, so you should just watch it! As serious as the show could be, though, it has plenty of humor to balance it out. Even more to add, the show sends many good messages to the children that watch the show. They teach kids that even when something doesn't turn out the way you want it to, it just gives opportunities for other good things to happen (If every pork chop were perfect, we wouldn't have hot dogs!); others are still people, and deserve to be given a chance because no one is truly evil (This is seen in basically every moment Steven has to figure out how to solve an problem that someone else is causing); etc. There is so much more, but I can only hold someone's attention for so long.",2015
10,Steven Universe is just one of the best cartoons i've ever watched in all my life.,2014
10,This show is highly addictive and entertaining. I never expected it to be this great. A friend recommended it to me since I am cartoon fan. I only wish I had seen it sooner. ,2015
10,"It's impossible for me to give this show all of the praise it deserves in writing. Steven Universe has made one of the most real, thought provoking, progressive, and honest cartoon environments I've ever seen. The life lessons taught by characters are meaningful and honest, always trying to encourage learning by trying rather than not taking risks. Steven as a main character still blows me away in his accuracy in portraying a young child's innocence and immaturity, while still making him a good role model and someone who you believe could be real. In fact, despite a sci fi context, all of the show's characters are so meticulously developed and realistic that it can almost feel at times like they're truly real individuals, with real issues that you not only recognize, but feel as if you want to help them with, and that you yourself care about. That in itself is very difficult for a show to pull off, especially an animated show, and ESPECIALLY a show oriented at kids! I literally have no idea how Rebecca Sugar can make so many things possible at once, from songs to life lessons to representations of different sexual orientations, everything is there and it all works just beautifully. Steven Universe deserves much more attention than it has currently, because it is truly on track to be a series in the ranks with greats like Avatar: The Last Airbender.",2015
10,"as soon as I saw the commercial for this and saw Rebecca Sugar, I automatically recognized her. She writes a few songs for Adventure Time. the commercial for the actual show is adorable, I think. And in the commercial, she was right, the characters aren't perfect but that's what makes them so great.The animation is cute and I adore the characters. I feel like the characters are very original Although I cannot give a great review on this show, I can say that I am definitely watching more next week.",2013
10,"Funny, cool, this is the best Cartoon Network show I've ever seen! All I have to say is, people, rate it a 10 out of 10!! Keep the show going!The first show is actually kind of inspiring at the end... It made me feel happy and also I hope it has a lot more episode! I thought it was going to be dumb before it came on but it was actually awesome! So cool I T I S C O O L Watch it! ! Steven! I hope you like the Show! We are the crystal gems we always save the day and if you think we can we Always find a way that's what the people of this world believe in Garmet amethyst and pearl And STEVEN!

9,"Available online or Mondays at 8/7c on cartoon network, Steven Universe is a new cartoon I had been meaning to check out for a while. Created by Adventure Time writer, story boarder, and composer Rebecca Sugar (you can see her work in the episode ""Simon and Marcy""); ""Universe"" is a fun loving blend of smooth bright animation, comedy, and fantastic yet still growing lore (plus a witty and respectful pinch of life lessons and seriousness). Only ten episodes into the series, I can give it a solid 8 out of ten stars, and if it can continue this notable streak of entertaining episodes, I foresee lots of Adventure Time or Bee and Puppy Cat-esk fandom emerging.",2014
10,"This show is one of the best youth TV shows out there. Compared to all the other youth TV shows, the story of Steven Universe makes sense. If you think that the series is cheesy, just continue watching the episodes of the series and the entire series will make sense. ",2015
10,"The show if freaking fantastic. Well, I can't decide which is better - Steven Universe or Regular Show.",2015
9,"I first heard of this show from its original pilot episode. The colors were dark, and it looked like a lot of shows that were already on CN, but i was still interested because of the creative characters. However, I'm extremely impressed with the design choice for the show. The bright colors are just so fitting, but not to a point of head-achingly bright. ",2014
10,"I LOVE this show. When I first saw the commercials, I was a little unsure because the main character, Steven, seemed loud and annoying. Boy, am I glad I actually watched it! Now, I'm hooked. The artwork is clean, bright and gorgeous! ",2014
9,"OK, when i first saw Steven Universe it was the newest show on cn, and to be honest I wasn't all that impressed. I knew Rebecca Sugar worked on AT and helped write some awesome episodes and original songs for the series so I had high expectations, but all I saw was a cutesy show aimed at kids. I liked the art style and loved the character designs but I stopped watching/caring after 3-4 episodes because I got bored.",2015
10,"CN really did good on this one! It seems like for every 10-20 shows they excrete,one is actually worth something. I enjoy the artwork, the action, and the comedy, but the relationships are what I'm a sucker for. I love how the gems treat Steven like he's their own son. They always look out for him and no matter what, they'r always on his side. The gems themselves are my favorites. They're kind of like the Powerpuff Girls, but they're grown women. And they're basically deities! They never age, and I don't even think they're capable of dying. Steven has the coolest mommas ever, and I quite honestly am jealous. There's plenty of funny moments, but it's not stupid funny like Uncle Grandpa(which is NOT funny). I gotta hand it to Cartoon Network. They did alright for once.",2015
9,"Okay, I know saying Steven Universe is my favorite cartoon is a little cheesy and over used, but this cartoon is beautiful after seeing cartoon networks uncle grandpa I thought I was done with cartoon network but this show made me regret anything I had said about the CN. The theme song is amazing only to be upped by their witty lines and comical mischief. Although the animation style is not my favorite and cartoon, networks should demand better, they make up for it with the story line. it delivers joy and fun while having small hints of tragedy and grief, this combination has been ignored by CN. I really like how this show is original and not just another knock off like teen titans go, and the tom and jerry show. (which are both terrible.) I hope this show inspires cartoon network to keep on this track and to not lack the fundamentals and principles CN was founded on.",2015
10,"This is my Favorite New Cartoon. Hands down. I have not hated a single Episode of the so far 20 that have been Produced. Some early reviewers dropped out due to it looking or appearing stupid or it sending a ""Bad Racial Message"". These things couldn't be more ridiculous to me.",2014
8,"Steven Universe is a show written and directed by one of the lead animators off Adventure Time, and it shows.",2014
10,"This show is amazing. I wasn't going to write a review, then I saw the top one that says it's not doing very well popularity wise. I really hope that's wrong. This show has depth, and I am definitely addicted. Great show; keep it going please, don't cancel. I can't think of any other cartoon network show that I actually enjoy as much as this. Even Adventure time isn't as good.",2015
10,"When I first saw the previews on CN in 2013, I thought it was gonna be another dumb show about another dumb kid, But oh boy was I wrong. ",2015
10,"The art of the show is pleasant to look at and adds to the sense of wonder in the show appreciated by and interacted with all the characters. The characters are all complex and with the potential to develop. The sense of wonder is parallel to but perhaps better than Adventure Time. Every character is unique and the interactions with each other emphasize this all the more. Then, there is the team dynamics which is intriguing to watch with the various clashes of ego and passivity. Lastly, there is the social positives with a strong cast of female characters, different ethnicities, and different body types. Steven Universe is a great show and worth watching.",2014
10,"This show is amazing in a number of ways typically unmet by mass media. While it undoubtedly hits all the bases of being a typical kid's cartoon, what with the young protagonist, his love of spending time with his friends, and his sometimes-zany adventures, Steven Universe is also an impressive show in its sense of inclusiveness. The show represents people of different races, different body types, different sexualities, different personalities, and different ages, with a great deal of sensitivity. ",2015
7,"Yet another instance of cartoon network finding a strong personality again, and giving us more laid-back, imaginative shows. This is also their first show with a female creator. The show was made by Rebecca Sugar, who was a former writer and musician for Adventure Time, and an all-around likable person. This is all evident within the series. There seems to be an idea going around that this show is ""Adventure Time Lite"", and while I understand that there are similarities between the two, they are still more different from one another than most non-serious cartoons are. By that logic, ""The Fairly Oddparents"", ""Johnny Bravo"", ""My Life as a Teenage Robot"", ""Samurai Jack"", and ""The Powerpuff Girls"" are all ""Dexter's Lab Lite"". Anyway, this is a great show with good subtle moral lessons and unique characters. Honestly, this is yet another sign that some cartoonists actually have a solid understanding and implementation of what makes this generation of entertainment good, rather than what makes it bad.",2014
10,"I saw an advanced screening of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" last night. To the right person, this movie is life-changing, life-affirming, and truly beautiful. No, the narrative isn't perfect. The script isn't perfect. There are narrative flaws and stretches of the imagination, but this movie is about stretching the imagination.",2013
10,"I expected this to be funny and perhaps a little goofy. What it is is a breathtaking work of art. This is Ben Stiller at his best. The movie is just wonderful. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. It's entertaining throughout. The pace may seem slow at times to those used to action packed films, but I personally don't care for nonstop technically enhanced action scenes for no apparent reason. I've been hoping people would tire of those for some time now, so we can get back to good stories again. This was a great story, loosely based on the original short story by James Thurber. I wish there were more movies out there like this. That would definitely get me back into movie theaters. As well...the acting was superb all around. Kristen Wiig was outstanding--as usual. I think this may be her best work as well.",2013
10,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the preview. I was a big fan of the original story, and although I knew the movie would be very different, I could see that this would end up being one of my favorite movies. I was not disappointed.",2013
8,"One really has to wonder what the professional reviewers are really thinking. We looked over the family movie list and barely decided to go to this one based on lackluster reviews. Six out of six of us REALLY liked it and found it deep and entertaining, and easy to watch. By all means, if you are looking to enjoy a movie, go see this one.",2013
10,"I loved this movie. I know some critics say this movie is like flicking through a National Geographic magazine. I disagree, this movie is a well-balanced triumph. Fantastic views, simple yet wonderfully poignant story line and strong lead actor. Kristen wig and Sean Penn had unidimensional roles within the movie but they are not the leads. The humor was tasteful, adequate and well placed. It was such a pleasant surprise from your day to day blockbuster and I strongly prefer this movie to the desolation of Smaug which I watched the night before. Ben Stiller has managed to achieve an impossible feat with this movie, an elegant contemporary film without excessive emotional histrionics or sexual overtones. Strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a modern take on life. Just like the lead, Walter Mitty is your everyday guy doing an everyday job faced with realistic modern day issues. One day, he takes a leap of faith and that has made all the difference. How can anyone not love this movie?",2013
9,"In Afghanistan on the snow covered Himalayan Mountains grizzled and world wise Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn gazes at his coveted photo moment. Sean says that all he wants is to be ""in the moment"". Sean Penn is selfless gravitas in this moment as he confides in Ben Stiller's exasperated mild mannered Walter Mitty, who literally travels to the ends of the earth to track down the maverick old-school legendary photographer. Be in the moment and be present in life--are the eloquently poignant lyrics of Director Ben Stiller's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"". ",2013
7,"I saw this movie on a special sneak preview event. I admit being utterly mesmerized by some of the trailers. I did really enjoy the film. It has a nice message and is definitely a feel good movie. There is nothing wrong with that. For me, this is the most beautifully looking film I've seen this year. The cinematography and camera shots were fantastic - right up there with Life of Pi and Gravity. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I personally enjoyed Ben Stiller in a more serious role. The film has comedic elements but everything is a bit more subtle and reflective of a man trying to find his inner courage and voice.",2013
10,"I have given this a ""10"" rating. There was one minor issue I had with the movie that would make it not quite that in my mind, but a ""9"" rating would be an injustice to this extraordinary film and, since I'm unable to give it a 9.75 or something like that, ""10"" it is. ",2013
8,"I would like to open with one word; Wow. I had been wanting to watch this movie since I had seen the first trailer. After being invited to an advanced showing I got very excited. The movie was outstanding. The cinematography was perfect and the character development was extraordinary. The film was very well paced and at no point did i believe the film was too short or that I felt rushed during the movie. It has its action moments and satire, but overall it is a very happy film. I will most likely see the film in the future again because this is up there with Forrest Gump and Django Unchained as a near perfect movie.",2013
9,"Loosely based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty explores the idyllic fantasies of its titular protagonist, as he attempts to escape the mundane motions of his daily routine employment at Life Magazine. When Mitty (Ben Stiller) discovers that photojournalist Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has misplaced negative 25, intended for the cover of the final print of the publication, he sets out on a larger-than-Life journey to locate the missing photograph, while reducing his need for daydreams as he discovers that not even his wildest fantasies are a match for an adventurous reality.",2013
4,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; one of many movies released over this holiday season is about a timid photographer who works for Life magazine and sets off on the journey of his lifetime to find a missing print and photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). The movie's motive (at least it seems) for audiences of today is to experience new things and find what you're looking for in your life. If you're as shy as Walter, find that experience or excitement and fill that hole, yadda yadda yadda. That message is all fine and dandy, but to what cost? The Secret Life of Walter Mitty becomes so extreme that it takes away from it's original motive; and it suffers. There is just too much riff raff going on in this movie for me to enjoy it.",2014

And got all the answers and it was worth to watch plane beginning.I was truly amazed of this film, at first i thought it would be more comedy type, but no. This film is really beautiful, with beautiful music, landscapes. This film makes beautiful with, what feeling its giving. This film is inspiring to those who want to do big steps in life, but never take chances of being afraid all the time of whats gonna wait them out there in another world. Easy to watch and enjoy even when you're alone in the bed. I recommend to watch this film ,wont regret.",2016
9,"Actually just one of them would make me want to give this a 10/10 and it is very close in my eyes. The scene I'm talking about involves a helicopter and a song that really got under my skin. If you don't feel a thing during that scene ... well I don't know what to say. The whole thing is build upon feelings and dreams. Obviously breaking out of them and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.",2014
7,"Anyone expecting Ben Stiller to recycle the two principal intertexts for this story - the James Thurber story or the classic Danny Kaye comedy from 1947 - is likely to be highly disappointed. Superficially the plot remains the same, with Stiller playing a put-upon employee of LIFE magazine who is bullied by the new boss Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott), but eventually discovers himself as a result of a once-in-a-lifetime trip to find elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), who possesses an elusive negative needed for the final print copy of the magazine. Needless to say everything ends happily, with Mitty discovering to his delight that the photograph celebrates the work of all LIFE's employees - journalists, printers, editors, photo-staff - who made the magazine such an American institution. He also manages to convince the love of his life, Cheryl Melhoff (Kirsten Wiig) of the sincerity of his intentions. At heart, however, WALTER MITTY is a story of the importance of discovering yourself, even if the odds seem stacked against you. Walter learns to follow his inclinations, and by doing so fulfills his mother Edna's (Shirley MacLaine's) aspirations for him. Stiller gives a delightful performance, his character gradually changing from one of wide-eyed stoicism (which provokes him to daydream) into a person of quiet strength, who is not frightened of confronting Hendricks and telling the boss exactly what he thinks. At another level WALTER MITTY can be seen as an elegy for LIFE magazine, that bastion of American journalism, which has now become an online-only journal due to falling sales and changing reader preferences. The film uses archive material to show how it chronicled all the major events and personalities of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and how its staff (for the most part) were dedicated to their work. It's the kind of magazine that doesn't deserve to be taken over by superficial ignoramuses such as Hendricks, whose principal concern is for profitability rather than journalistic integrity.",2014
3,"There's a chance you may like this, in which case I don't really want to taint your expectations with the things that follow.

2,"Definitely one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Stiller's mediocre acting ability isn't even worth one tenth of Danny Kaye's and this feeble attempt to remake the glorious original is an insult to the greater (and hugely funnier) actor. The Stiller character is just a geeky, annoying loser who I found difficulty finding any empathy for. There were a few genuinely funny moments in the film but mostly long periods of complete tedium. Sean Penn was wasted in a pointless cameo role and the entire storyline was implausible and lacked any real substance or depth. The female love interest wasn't even very interesting, but then, looking at Stiller's character, it's unlikely that he would be aiming high.",2014

9,"Interesting story line for those of you who have the slightest clue of history. Other reviewers talk about ""supernatural"" plot lines. I had to chuckle. This series is based on a scandalous time in history. It is pretty factual with some added creative license. Historical events of this family and time involve accusations of witchcraft. This is not a Hollywood conjured up plot line with supernatural concoctions to make a series more interesting as other reviewers suggest. After this first episode, I would say it rates mountains above most garbage you see on US television. Elizabeth Grey reigned as queen for 19 years. I recommend a Google search for some of you to get a taste of the juicy storyline this series will bring.",2013

8,"One night early there was a preview showing of this new series from the Brits. It looks promising if a bit unorthodox in its approach to history and slips in the settings and costumes. The series is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, 'The Cousins' War' and roughly the story line promises to follow these lines: Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, the series is the story of the women caught up in the long-drawn-out conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464--the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate behind the scenes of history--Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville.",2013
10,"This is such a wonderful story and great cast, I am captivated by this all aspects. I waited for a few episodes before watching, as I new I'd love this show and it would be in great pain for me to wait each week for the next episode to show. It is the much watch series of the year for sure! I do like how it is realistically portrayed and that it speaks in a secret way that sexuality had a great deal to do with how history is affected by it and how love/lust can change decisions that affect the aristocracy. Women have many powers for sure, but of all else it's those who know how to use their sexuality, denying the needs of those spoiled and use to getting their ways, become the main way one can aspire to a higher status. Grey is smart in her rise to the throne, though it is her mother who is the smartest of all. In a time of deception, chaos and death, love can exist, though it also seems to show that it can not last and in a time of war, Love is Never enough. Power is the ultimate gain and the end game is to be the ruler.",2013
3,"The Wars of the Roses is one of the most intriguing periods in British history with enough material to even make several seasons of a well written series, so I had great hopes for this one. What we get is a boring history lesson. Faction A fights faction B and then someone changes sides, they have couple of battles and then they switch sides again. Never we get a proper explanation as to why things happen. Where's the politics, where's the machinations? The whole script lacks depth and is devoid of intrigue. The characters are underdeveloped and feel like cardboard figures. The viewer has to make do with some badly written, phony dialog and a unnecessarily high emphasis on witchcraft. Did they really think this mumbo jumbo can make up for the lack of actual storytelling? It does get a little bit better after seven episodes, just a little. I know many people in England don't believe that Richard III killed the princes in the tower, but the writers go out of their way to place the blame with either Margaret Beaufort or Anne Neville. The whole thing reeks of a Richard III apology.",2013

8,"If you are of the disposition to enjoy extravagant production values, a handsome cast and plots compromised of devious political maneuvering, then it will be easy to appreciate BBC One's epic saga The White Queen for the rollicking good drama that it is. If, however, you are a narc for period accuracy, it's probably best to stick to the history channel.",2013
1,"I admit I only watched White Queen for a short time, but that was because I was totally distracted by Elizabeth's long flowing CRIMPED hair. I thought if they can get something like that so spectacularly wrong, how can they get the history right? I know it may be nitpicky, but I was just really put off by it. Surely the hair dept should've know electric crimpers weren't around in the 15th century?",2017
2,"A pretty disappointing start. The presentation of our 'hero' is a right mess. We're lead to believe he is dangerous and sexually threatening (which he is, it turns out!). It's confusing for the audience because our 'heroine' is clearly fearful of him. So she should be: he can destroy her and her family on a whim and he is also responsible for the death of her husband. When they meet she is desperate to secure her family's heritage while he is just desperate to have sex with her. And then later he tries to rape her. And yet... she suddenly declares her burning, undying love for him.",2013
2,"I read somewhere that this TV adaptation cost $10 million, or was it 10 million euros? If so, where did the money go, because it certainly was not spent on the writing or location or sets or props or accurate costumes (Zippers? Are you kidding?). And once Max Irons got the part, the first thing he should have done was get to a gym. In no way, shape or form, as the young Edward, did he have the hard, muscular build of a warrior king. I wonder if he would even be able to lift the sword of King Edward. Pallid and fleshy when the shirt came off. ",2013

I was ify about it at first even though I always find historic shows and movies very interesting, then watched it on demand and was in amazement how fantastic it was. I am going to be upset when the season ends. Will definitely be watching the entire season again thanks to starz on demand. Max Irons is an amazing actor as is his father. I have a new celebrity crush. The entire cast are great actors. I keep telling everyone I know to watch the show. It is definitely my favorite show. Thank you to Starz for another entertaining show. I just hope that they continue the show with many more seasons and episodes. It is by far the best show on television right now. It is historic, entertaining, intriguing, and makes me never want to stop watching. I am not yappy when the episode is over.",2013

It is the story of the turbulent 30 years of almost continuous war between two rival families: the House of York (the white rose) and the House of Lancaster (the red rose) ~ the English War of the Roses. And it is the story of three queens: Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville. Their actions, thoughts, and desires are the foundation on which this excellent story lies.",2015

3,I will keep this short and to the point. Please remember these are simply MY opinions and thoughts on this show.,2013
1,"If you like fantasy, with swords and sorcery, I recommend Mr Jackson's excellent adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"", if you want medieval history, avoid this programme like the plague. I speak as a historian, and one who studies the costuming of the period, and by strange chance, I happen to be descended from many of the historical characters represented in this appalling travesty. My husband enjoyed the series, I had a look in at one point, saw costuming spanning a few centuries and several different countries (one of which was closed with a zipper, clearly viewed from the back in one scene). If you can't be bothered to get minor details right, just don't bother. Which is excellent advice for this series. Don't bother.",2013
4,"This review is based solely on the first episode. From what I've seen, I will not be investing more time in subsequent episodes.",2013
10,"I was utterly drawn in by the series from episode 1. I'll give nothing regarding plot away to those of you who have yet to watch it, however I will say this; the historical context of 'The White Queen' is compromised primarily by the fact that it is a BBC drama, and therefore it's goal is ultimately to entertain an audience. It is not, therefore, a history book or derived verbatim from the depths of historical archives and contemporary texts/literature, thus it achieves exactly what it ought to. It is interesting, moving, riddled with angst, violence, love, sex, betrayal etc. It encompasses many of the things that a good drama should, whilst following the theme of a book by Philippa Gregory and recreating an actual time line of events, albeit loosely in some areas. This is no easy task, and in my opinion the actors and actresses do a wonderful job in both depicting character and storytelling.",2013
4,"While an enjoyable drama, and more faithful to the book than most TV series tend to be these days, there are too many silly mistakes and anachronisms in this series. I am used to BBC and ITV getting at least the visuals right: costumes, furnishings, customs are usually spot on. But in this ""extravaganza"", while the costumes are pleasant, you mustn't look too close or you will see a painfully obvious zipper down Elisabeth's back in Episode one, while Edward wears a cross quilted ""doublet"" that looks more like a Husky vest, right down to what look suspiciously like metal poppers to fasten it. In Episode Two we are treated to a closeup of Elisabeth putting on the coronation ring...while sporting a modern French manicure, white tips, shiny gloss sealer coat and all. As others have mentioned, there are many errors in furnishings as well--not to mention that young girls seem to travel the tracks and countryside unaccompanied...smack dab in the middle of the Wars of the Roses? Elisabeth takes off to London with her sisters and cousins...and not a single armed escort to be seen. This lack of protection seems to be a constant in her travels; perhaps her mother's reputed witchcraft (sigh) protects her? Granted few TV production companies are going to show audiences what the time period was really like, with its filth, disease, and lack of heating (which would preclude some of the naked romping), but this series requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief if you know anything of English social history beyond the elaborate chessgame of politics and kingmaking.",2013
10,"I Love this show! I find it so interesting and entertaining! I can't get enough of it and I look forward to it every week. If you haven't watched it yet I suggest you do. I really think that it could have a little less nudity. Don't get me wrong, its not too bad, but those few parts where it is, I usually have to change the channel because I have 3 young kids who like the show too and watch it with me. That's really the only thing I don't like about it. Really, it does portray history very well, nothing is to unbelievable, but I'm not sure everything is accurate also. I hope if you haven't watched this show you will and if you have then I hope you like it as much as I do!",2013
10,"The White Queen is a dramatisation of England's Wars of the Roses, the era that inspired George RR Martin's Game of Thrones novels. Told from the perspective of 3 ambitious women, all vying for the English throne, The White Queen has power plays and backstabbing, House loyalties and shifting allegiances, battles, and a little witchcraft for good measure. Loved this series! ",2014
8,"I was a combat soldier in the Vietnam conflict. The first thing that comes to my mind watching this film was the equipment used by modern soldiers. In Vietnam we had the clothes on our back, just underwear and shirt, pants, boots, and our weapon. Some soldiers wore ""flack vests"" but where I served with a small unit in the jungles of the south, I never saw that. It was just your weapon and the clothes on your back. As to the story, it raises from the very beginning all sorts of moral questions. The film opens with actual footage of the over the top training and stress imposed on elite fighting units such as the Navy Seals. We see signs right from the beginning of the film that such severe and brutal training regimens set up a trauma and stress situation inside the emotions and lives of soldiers. There is a critical point in the film where the choice to kill ""innocent"" people or not to kill them changes everything that happens later. A lot of people will argue about what the choice should have been, and how it might have changed the soldiers chances of survival. That moment is a key to understanding what comes after in the film.",2014
7,Lone Survivor (2013),2014
9,"The movie is not easy to watch. Right at the beginning you'll some training ""videos"" (more like footage) from the real people that are depicted in this movie. But it will be apparent a couple of moments later, that there is a lot of Death to follow. It's almost a case of what can go wrong will go wrong. And while there are a lot of other outcomes that this could've taken, decisions had been made, consequences had to be taken (upon).",2014
5,"I really don't wish to offend anyone with this, but whenever you have a film like ""Lone Survivor"" that resonates so strongly with the movie going public, it's easy to be labeled a certain way if you don't follow the film's attitude. I respect director Peter Berg's intentions; he wanted to make a film about this group of soldiers performing their duty, what they are trained to do and what so few are capable of, and the consequences of that job. However, I feel like real life soldiers are more humble than this film is subtle.",2014
8,"As many war films have surfaced along the years, Lone Survivor is one of the better depictions of true events. Lone Survivor stands as an outstanding account of bravery and comradeship under fire, with acts of selflessness abounding. And director Berg (Friday Night Lights) could not have presented it more humanistically, or with more compassion for those who gave their lives on a mission that was doomed from the start. As it observes one of the four SEALS originally dropped onto Sawtalo Sar, the rugged mountain near Asadabad where insurgent leader Ahmad Shah was believed to be commanding a large band of Taliban fighters. ""No curse,"" Luttrell replies, ""just Afghanistan."" But cursed they were, as Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and fellow SEALs Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and their leader, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), encounter nothing but horrible luck after confirming Shah's presence.",2015
9,Holy sh*t......,2014
10,"If you read the book and heard the interviews with the actual ""lone survivor"" you know that this movie got as close to the real events as possible. The 4 actors really gave it their all. Beginning long before shooting when they started their training so they would look realistic. This movie is also the most visceral experience since ""Saving Private Ryan"". There were falls in this movie that actually hurt more just watching than when I broke my foot 2 years ago. And in the making of you see that crazy stunt people actually did those falls, supposedly without dying. It's of course impossible to spoil this movie given it's title but it's important to note that the guy who helped him risked his whole village for ""The Americans"" Safety. And he didn't think twice about it. Sometimes we forget that not all of them are Taliban. After all is said and done this is a must see if there ever was one.",2014

4,"I have already seen Lone Survivor and it was not to my liking unfortunately. I feel the film is completely absurd with 4 Americans shooting and killing about 100 Taliban who continue to attack in waves and are slaughtered while the Americans spend about half the film rolling down a mountain and slamming into rocks and trees...the film is based on a false premise of killing 3 goat herders or releasing them...the actual answer is you hold on to them until the exact moment you get safely into the rescue copter and then you let them go. If you have to march miles and miles you take the goat herders with you. If you can't march them any further you tie them to a tree. In addition, the 4 Americans hunker down on a mountain top and don't appear to have any clay-more mines with tripwires. These are normally set up around the perimeter of an area where Americans are hunkered down. The Americans also went into a combat mission with crappy phones...since their cellphones suck it makes the rest of their fancy equipment and diagram drawing of targets seem silly and pointless. The dialog in this film is poorly written but the acting in and of itself is decent with the best work done by Ben Foster. Mark Wahlberg plays it straight and does not try and over-act and gives a good performance overall. In this movie, the Taliban are brainless and have no problem with losing dozens of seasoned fighters in order to try and kill 3-4 Americans. This is a film where every single time the Americans fire a bullet there is a Taliban going down in a large blood splatter and it seems like it takes about 300 Taliban bullets to kill a single American. Yeah right. This film is a propaganda recruitment film for the US military which in and of itself is not such a bad thing. To be clear the US military is filled with heroes fighting for America's freedom everyday....but this film is more like a Sgt. Rock comic book....you have been warned...now go see the film and write your own review!",2014

The source of that story is the book with the same title by Marcus Luttrell, who was indeed the sole survivor of a four-man SEAL team in the mountains of Afghanistan. Endorsing this movie requires ignoring basic military protocols, suspending the laws of physics, and disregarding the capabilities of the human body. The Devil, as always, is in the details.",2014
10,"Some have cast doubts on the verisimilitude of parts of this picture. Of course, those who impugn whether some events really happened or whether they happened the way they are depicted in the movie neither underwent the kind of training Navy S.E.A.Ls do nor did they ever find themselves in circumstances remotely approaching those of the four comrades. We do not know what punishment the human body is truly capable of withstanding until we are put to an extreme test, gods forbid.",2014
1,"Awful. However I enjoy war films that make an impact, showing war for what it is. This film was miles off that mark. Making comedy to please the arena.

There were absolutely no combat tactic's of any real battle significance shown as established.",2014
3,"Let's for a moment abstract away all the blue team good, red team bad stuff and focus on the facts of this movie as we are told them. ",2014
10,"Lone Survivor depicts the failed Operation Red Wings mission in 2005 in which 18 members of the US Armed Forces were killed in action. The film delivers a heavy handed patriotic look inside what happened during those fateful hours. Right off the bat, the film starts with honoring the men and women who serve the United States in the military via a very powerful, if not, melodramatic montage. We then are introduced to Navy SEALs, Marcus, Mike, Axe, and Danny, all played brilliantly by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster. The actors in this film exude the necessary chemistry for the audience to really feel these characters as not just characters in the film, but in real life as well. From Wahlberg to Foster, all four leads play their roles very carefully and it pays off especially when we see each of them in peril. With such a connection made in the first slow building hour, we are then dropped into a forty five minute, pulse pounding shootout between a huge Taliban force and four trained Navy SEALs. As the title suggest, the shootout does not end pretty and never even comes close to sugar coating the brutal nature of war. The entire shootout sequence is filled with hard edged moments of brutality, gore and truly gut wrenching scenes. It is by far one of the most heart racing moments in recent cinema and considering the end results, it is very heart wrenching that by the end of it, you feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you. By the end of the film, Lone Survivor makes you really appreciate the freedom you have, a feat that has not yet been achieved in film up until now. This film is as good as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it is absolutely worth seeing on the big screen and I highly recommend it.",2014
4,"Let me begin by saying IMDb scores should have a equal global point system for each movie and not flooded by American bias voting, OK the movie is OK to a point but be prepared to suspend your disbelief longer than necessary while watching a film that begins with ""this is based on a true story"".",2014
1,"I was traumatized by this film. Never in all my years of sitting through war films have I been so offended. I've played Call of Duty games with more authenticity and conscience than this travesty. I expect this level of soulless drivel from Bana and Wallyberg but Foster is going to be yogic flying for the rest of this life and a few reincarnations to make up for this one. Kitsch, well, Battleship looks pretty good in retrospect.",2013
1,"Completely unrealistic movie. Propaganda film, as the Soviet of fifty years ago. Do not watch! They tried to fix bad image of American soldiers and the things they made ​​in the recent wars and have made some bad mix of Superman and Rambo. People are dropping tens of meters down a rocky mountain, strike with a head in stone but firing unerringly, killing hundreds of opponents, who are naturally evil, dirty and sad examples of human beings. Do you remember the worst war movie you watched? This one is several times worse. I can not believe that anyone could give this movie a positive evaluation. In war, people can overcome their opportunities, especially superbly trained soldiers but there are limits to what the human body can not handle. Header into the rock after tumble at high speed down the mountain is one of them.",2014
8,"An undeniable aspect of war, whether or not you make rationalizations on its regrettable purpose or demonize its existence entirely, is that it's an utter hell that tries the mentality and physicality of the courageous men and women who fight in the conflict. Most war films have captured the hellish and nonsensical brutality of war through challenging cinematic portraits, either through the allegorical heart of darkness showcased in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the apathetic political influences in Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory, and even in cinema's first triumphant reflections with the adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front. But while all wars impact people there aren't enough films that showcase true examples of wartime heroism which neglects a chance to embrace the humanity in the soldiers who are put into these tumultuous and life threatening circumstances. This is where Peter Berg's ominously titled latest film Lone Survivor differs from the a vast majority of the war film experience because rather than postulating on the reasons or criticisms for war it only seeks to depict the strong links of brotherhood involved in our armed forces ranks through an effective nonpartisan slant. Returning to his attention to detail roots showcased in The Kingdom and leaving behind an unfortunate deviation into the ridiculous with Battleship, Berg has concocted a relatively solid film in Lone Survivor that follows the real life events that happened in 2005 to Navy SEAL Mark Luttrell and his team in the Afghanistan Mountains when a secret operation is compromised. Though the film could have had deeper character development and interaction in the first quarter of the film, an aspect that slightly detriments the overall impact of the picture, its solid and intimate middle core of brutally authentic wartime conflict captured in real time is a technically astounding, emotionally engaging, and definite pulse pounding experience. To the film's creative credit in staying true to the events that transpired it demonstrates that the relentless pummeling of war doesn't always come with the Hollywood convention that is graceful relief giving the film a true experience of modern warfare. Lone Survivor might have its storytelling flaws, mainly due to a conventional structure and some fairly assumed character involvement, but when it erupts into the focused intimacy of soldier bonding amidst the chaotic brutality of battle in the middle of the film it becomes a relatively involving homage to the relentless dedication of spirit within our soldiers.",2013

It covers the drama, loves and lives of those who live in and around that homestead, including a mysterious woman who arrives via ship from overseas. Beautifully written and filmed with gorgeous locations, it is a quality program that reinforces Australia's ability to produce world class drama. Noni Hazelhurst plays the family matriarch, Elizabeth, with a cool, calculating menace - her family give her plenty to contend with as their individual and collective secrets are revealed and her ability to hold everything together becomes more and more of a challenge!

So, So, disappointed. First it was ""Rafters"" now ""A Place to call Home"", surely you can see we need some good homegrown drama. Please, Please, reconsider and bring on another series and finish it off properly, it deserves a decent ending.",2014

Unfortunately, the series was half way through the story. But the more I watched it, the more I liked it. The cast were terrific and while the series, unlike so much of the local television, looked like an A-grade period drama. Nostalgia is a potent sentiment, one that transcends even the most stubborn cringers. As the season come to an end, I found myself happily reporting that, despite my assumptions, A Place to Call Home actually explores with real sophistication the stuff that resonates powerfully in our national consciousness – a longing for the past, and a longing for home – and that makes for great television. Luckily I have been able to get the DVD not long after it was released. Unfortunately, I won't be able to see the second series next year.

I'm a Brit expat and husband is American, we both loved this post WW2 drama. The cast is superb and make this series all the more compelling. The 50s' feel is well done, as is the portrayal of the three generations and how they cope with their different - and unexpected yet similar - experiences. Not to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, the series generally takes us to fresh plots/characterizations in ways other shows haven't. Bravo! We saw series 2 on the BBC and anxiously await its screening on Acorn Media next month. Series 3 is apparently being filmed now to be shown later in the year with a 4th to follow.

The historical post-war setting is also very interesting, and the story lines are amazing. Usually there are some characters I don't care about, but not here.

10,"This series is simply brilliant and I don't say that about many programmes. The acting is extremely good and the characters draw you in and adhere to 'real life' situations and it addresses real issues with sensitivity and great professionalism. With so many 'reality programmes' on with so called 'celebrities', this is truly a breath of fresh air. I like the way it addresses how WWII affected individuals and weaves it into the 50's time-line. It doesn't shirk the difficulties experienced with newly weds, Anna & Gino and George & Olivia, both compelling scenarios. Also, the actress who plays Mrs Bligh has got it just right and demonstrates brilliantly how an individual's character is dynamic and every changing to what life can throw at us with ever changing twists and turns that I believe we all experience in some small or large way. This personalises it to my experiences and touches on a nerve that makes me want to watch the next episode as soon as possible. Thank you all who made this possible.",2016

I praise the actors for their ability to draw you into the story and to stir personal emotions.

We started this series between the others and have found it just as gripping but without the body count. All agree we are looking forward to a continuation of the series if the producers decide to continue. The series is about a family that endures more trauma than seemingly possible. Just when you think things may become bearable again something else happens. The acting is superb, the scenery and setting are excellent, the directing is spot on and we recommend it for adults who want to get wrapped up in a real life saga but do not want to see a shootem up.",2016
6,"A series that relies on Anti-Semitism to work but good old hatred and envy run a close second. Sarah Adams, Marta Dusseldorp, is returning to Australia after being away for twenty years. On the ship bringing her home, she is working as a nurse and she stops passenger James Bligh, David Berry, from killing himself. This chance encounter brings her into the life of the Bligh family. The male head of the family George Bligh, Brett Climo, forms a relationship with Sarah which brings down the wrath of his mother Elizabeth, Noni Hazlehurst, and the vicious jealously of his sister-in- law Regina Standish, Jenni Baird. While there are subplots aplenty in this high-class soap, it is watching the extreme viciousness of the females that will make most watch. There is a homosexual son, illegitimate babies, family secrets revealed, more skeletons (secrets) than closets, the aftermath of WW II, and far too many coincidences. Only thing left out, barely, is an Oedipus complex. The series also has a great musical score. Great fun overall but can get a bit tendentious at times. I have to admit at the end of season two episode four both I and my wife decided enough. A soap usually strains credulity but this series just didn't know how to stop becoming a caricature or what Sherwood Anderson would have classified as a grotesque.",2016
2,"After a few episodes it became obvious that this series was a soap opera of the worst type. I watched series 1-3 at which point the series was canceled ( no surprise to me) and then I began to watch the resurrection in series four.I have stopped watching Series four altogether after the first episode as it became more and more ridiculous and a waste of my time. The photography was very good and the views of the Australian countryside were excellent ( I have been to Australia) but the sets were bad and cheap . The casting was poor and the dialogue more like that of a Victorian era stage melodrama. Australians trying to sound like English nobility. Olivia and her Italian spouse, for example, were totally incompatible and unbelievable ( I cringed every time they were on the screen together) - in real life this marriage was doomed from the start. The various situations became more and more incredulous and unbelievable. Don't get hooked and waste your time!",2016
1,"I only watched most the first season of this Australian period drama, which at first I thought it would be Downton Down Under, but its more like Dallas, Dynasty and the more recently, Revenge, where nothing actually happens in the show and most of the ""drama"" is self created.",2017
9,"We are getting to what I assume is the end of the series and the closer it approaches, the more concerned I am getting because it seems, if the show has been axed, as someone reported, then at least there should be some form of closure for all the characters.",2016
4,"Our national broadcaster is showing ""A Place to Call Home"", and I thought it would be interesting to see what Australian TV looks like. My first impression was not favourable, but I thought I should hold off until I'd seen more. I've now seen all the episodes and my first impressions still stand.",2016
1,"The first three seasons were good and rather interesting but series four descended into typical soap opera nonsense with the recurring scenes depicting the aberrant behavior of the son. Apparently, the writer(s) wish to force this nonsense on viewers and thus, destroyed any enjoyment and anticipation we had for this season's continuation of the saga. Disappointing to say the least. Is this what Australian television has come to??? Added to the blatant attempt at political correctness were the silly situations and crises each and every character seemed to be having and how they dealt with them. All in all what started out as a nice picture and story of Australia in the 1950s became more and more proselytizing for an agenda and thus rather silly in the extreme.",2016
10,"I just finished Dr. Blake Mysteries and came across APtCH, what a lucky stumble (I've watched 3 episodes). I am bored with shows from the US, where I am from, and love BBC and now Australian shows. What I love about them are the global and historical story lines. Blake is set in the 1959, APtCH is also in the 1950s, Foyle's War begins in 1930s. All of these fantastic shows beautifully weave in what is going on politically, wars, race relations, class structures, women's (lack of) rights, and so on. ",2017
10,I have been watching the Sunday reruns of this show and I am riveted. Unfortunately when it was on at night it was too late for me to stay up and watch. Now I can watch it all in 6 hours every Sunday however....... I see Season 3 is going to Foxtel which I do not subscribe to and never will.,2015

9,"I stumbled across ""A Place to Call Home"" on Acorn TV. It shows life in the 1950's where any diversity in the population is suspect. Never mind that Australia, like America, had a large population of immigrants who came to the country earlier (regardless of how those first immigrants arrived) and now eschew and refuse to accept anyone who isn't exactly like themselves. I just finished Episode 5 in Series 1 and the series has already addressed a myriad of differences. You just know that everyone has secrets that motivate their behavior and those secrets are revealed in subtle ways that could happen in the repressed 1950's. ",2016
7,"My wife and I find this show very entertaining, though there are often times I find myself rolling my eyes. The heroin starts of as a nun (sister) who, after several episodes in, is actually Jewish (because nothing screams JUDAISM more than a blond hair blue-eyed Aryan married to Jesus). She is the moral conscience of the show, because in today's world morality means illegally disposing of a body, contemplating abortion, having sex outside of marriage, etc. Oh, and she is a Leftist/Communist freedom fighter/activist, at a time in history when Leftists/Communists killed people by the tens of millions. The anti-Communists in this show are either dimwitted or outrageously cruel. The rest of the cast seems heavily populated with gays (perhaps an exaggeration on my part), but since the writer, Bevan Lee, is gay, well, you write what you know. Never mind that in real life gays only comprise 2.8% of the population. Everyone in the shows needs to be taught a lesson in acceptance (they do call shows like this ""Programming"" for a reason). It is however a very captivating show and I will no doubt continue watching.",2017
7,"I absolutely loved the first two seasons of A Place to Call Home. The characters, story, cinematography, and production values were all excellent. It really drew me into the series and it was something I could enjoy watching with my parents. I know that the series was canceled after season 2, but then it got picked up by another producer.... And everything changed after that. The series wasn't as well-written, the characters started behaving in ways they wouldn't, and suddenly the previously tasteful sex scenes had gratuitous nudity that made me uncomfortable to watch with my parents. I managed to get through the season on my own, and season 4 did improve a bit, but I still miss the quality of the first 2 seasons.",2017
6,"Started out with realistic story lines, but as of season 3 became a little unbelievable.",2017
10,"Please help my curiosity. I missed an episode somewhere along the way and have no idea what happened to Gino's parents. I just see they are no longer around. Can someone help??? I LOVE this series. I am amazed that Regina is still around...and pray that she will be gone soon! I believe there is always a villain, but she's just nasty. Sarah has such insight to problems, she amazes me. I have wondered endlessly if Olivia and James will be back together after so many problems. Seems like they have insurmountable problems. Amazing how we dislike someone and then grow to love them later...Elizabeth was one of those. This series in on our local PBS station out of Atlanta and I think it's top notch. I applaud the producers, directors, the actors and the entire crew. Thank You!!!",2017
3,"I have only watched the second series, having done some research on the first series. This started out with a lot of promise ended up farcical. Elisabeth Moss lacks credibility as the lead and also as a police Detective. Her boss oozed being a real cop while the two females were a bit of a joke. Nicole Kidman plays the tree hugging gay mum with startling accuracy as far as a stereotypes go, but she was one shining light in what dragged on to become very average entertainment. Having surrounded ourselves with televisions shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Narcos, Ray Donovan, Ozark, Get Shorty this offering from Jane Campion was very very weak. It amazes me what peoples expectations of gritty drama is, when reviewers on here rate Top of the Lake so highly, when it is clearly in a much lower category than the example of shows I have just listed. In concluding, a few hours of my life I have wasted.",2017
2,S2 is a mess.,2017
4,"In a lake side town in New Zealand a 12 year old girl is discovered to be pregnant and detective played by Elizabeth Moss looks into the case.

10,"What a fantastic show this is so far! The acting is top notch, the atmosphere is spot on, the cinematography is breathtaking and its just really well done overall.",2013
8,"Season One Review: I've been looking at the reviews of the first season of this series, and I feel most of the negative ones are from people who simply wanted a very different show. There are inexplicable comparisons with Twin Peaks and complaints about the quality of the mystery, as though this is a series in which the central mystery is the selling point.",2015
10,"This is clearly a wonderful piece of work with very precise character development that is lacking in many current productions that have a lot more money to work with. There is a boatload of really skilled actors, a great writer/director, a story with motives slowly and carefully revealed and a beautiful location. As well it is a clever detective story. What more could you want. All the characters seem like real people in that they have all suffered or struggled in some way and are quite imperfect and have all wound in the same place. Really worth a look if you like good stories by professionals who get to tell the story the way they want.",2013
2,"I watched both seasons of this show and expected the second season to bring character development, there wasn't much of that. The show strives to create an atmosphere riddled with gloom, misogyny and a female lead battling all her inner demons and the circumstances her personal and professional career land her in. However, she fails to give a wholesome performance, there is something that fails to connect me to her, maybe it is the way she has been written or the actress herself. I did not like the way the female characters were written aside from Nicole Kidman's performance which frankly in my opinion outshone the rest of the cast. There is a lack of realistic portrayals of female characters in this show, and sadly I do not understand the way this show portrays a so called strong female character. Meh, maybe this show wasn't for me but I generally love this genre and have watched a lot of similar shows, but this one always makes me angry at the lack of reality in portraying a strong female lead, and the male characters are always linear and lack development.",2017
2,"(Spoilers) I watched this whole series mainly so I could comment on it here. I think any comments from someone who bails out are not to be highly valued, but if you gave up on this early while still thinking that it might get better, rest assured that it only gets worse as it goes along. ",2014
4,"I was looking forward to this series, pretty much on the basis of Jane Campion's reputation for quality writing and directing, and especially since her impressive last offering, 'Bright Star'.",2013
3,Felt compelled to write a review after reading the positive reviews here. Agree with those that thought it was awful. I watched through to the end because i wanted to know 'whodunnit' but actually it just left me dissatisfied.,2013
9,"Top of the Lake follows you around long after you've finished an episode (or the entire series, for that matter). It operates with a sophisticated sense of naturalism, which probably initially alienated many viewers begging to be bashed over the head with plot details. This is not simply a subtle noir, but a meditation on identity, which provides the necessary ammunition for some powerful performances from Elisabeth Moss, David Wenham, Peter Mullan and Holly Hunter, as well as others.",2013
9,"Brilliant character development; each character develops along true lines; their development is not hindered or compromised by the plot line. Beautiful plot twists; the obvious happening when unexpected and bolts from the blue when all seems straight forward. As confronting as real life itself. The cinematography has faithfully reflected the essence and ambiance of this special area. In episode 1 I was critical toward the US/Aust/NZ accent and inflection of Elisabeth Moss but then accepted it as part of her (Robyn's) character. Any misgivings (ABC) of her being cast in the role should totally have been cast aside by such a gritty performance. The glassing scene in the pub is cloned reality. Magnificent scenery, great acting, intuitive story telling.",2013
5,"So much hype, so much suspense and so many questions unanswered. Like others I was drawn to this show on Jane Campion's name alone. I didn't expect it to be straightforward, certainly not after watching the first episode and the story line was interesting enough to make me stay right up to the end. For what? Certainly not for any real explanations, nor for an answer to the question ""What was it really all about?""",2013
8,"If I had to describe this mini-series in a few key phrases it would be: beautiful scenery, great acting and a gripping plot.",2013
7,"Let's start with the good news. This quirky and idiosyncratic mini-series succeeds based on the so-called ""engagement factor"" that is, after a few hours, you become so enmeshed with the characters and their unpredictable behavior that you find yourself drawn into the production, a little at a time, and, then, like a lobster in a trap, you cannot let go until you see it to the end.The scenery is stunning and Preppers in particular looking for safe spot to survive the coming End of Days should definitely consider New Zealand as a destination of choice. The not-so-good news? Well, the aforementioned ""engagement factor"" is achieved at the expense of anything resembling a normal plot arc. In fact, this reviewer would opine that Campion and her team used that seeming weakness as a hidden strength, and basically threw the rulebook for a standard police procedural (I am thinking here Broadchurch, which is pitch-perfect and virtually lacking in flaws) out the window or, in this case, into the lake. In fact, the whole production plays more like a horror film than a mystery, with escalating, ongoing, bizarre behaviors from the lead players all leading, of course, to the Big Reveal. This comment on bizarre behaviors include, by the way, Elizabeth Moss whose character ""Robin"" is so odd and unpredictable that she teeters right on the edge of losing empathy with the audience, which, generally, is not a good thing. Always a delight to see Holly Hunter in front of the camera, one of our all-time faves, and well-reviewed in this database for her work in SAVING GRACE. Bottom line, and this is said without hesitation, Peter Mullan owns this production. It's his. You perhaps should need to email him for permission to watch it! His character is so charismatic, so wonderfully etched, that even when he is not in front of the camera, you are subliminally looking forward to his next 'on screen'. (Very old debate among cinephiles as to which ""accent"" makes for the best villains? Lately the nod has been going to the South African because it delivers bad news is a very impersonal polite, clipped, monotone. However, Mullan's performance here reminds me that I have always found Scottish street Brogue - not the Mel Gibson aristocratic stuff -- creepiest. Imagine your murderer telling you off just seconds before he actually does the deed -- AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE JUST SAID!? There is one scene in particular where, to make a point to a roomful of thugs who look like, on a whim, they could kill your whole family and then go out for pizza, he rummages around for a china cup that was the favorite of his long-dead mother. I won't offer a spoiler, but the scene is unforgettable).",2014
5,"I was so excited to see this mini-series, as I'd read several intriguing reviews. I'm always interested in independent, possibly dark and quirky plots, and I LOVE Elizabeth Moss. ""Top of the Lake"" is such a disappointment. Somehow I literally watched all six hours back-to-back as I kept hoping that it would turn a corner and redeem itself. No such luck. The plot ""twists"" are laughable, as are the intended ""red herrings"". I just relaxed and tried to give it all over to suspension of disbelief, but I had any and all ""twists"" figured out towards the very beginning. Some of the acting is great. The accents are all over the place: Scot, Aussie, American, etc. The plot is formulaic in places, and leaves all sorts of questions unanswered. (What is the full story behind Matt's self-flagellation? Isn't it obvious Al used roofies on Robin when she ""spent the night"" there? She even asked him ""WHAT was in that wine?"" Was Matt's profoundly erratic behavior due to brain damage from drug use or did the guy have a brain tumor? Did he rape Tui when he was in a fog? Obviously she'd been drugged. She seemed clueless.) I don't mind weird just for the sake of being weird, but so many of the details of this series just fall completely flat. Someone was really trying too hard. Save your time, and watch a documentary on the beautiful land of New Zealand, and watch another one of these fine actors' films. This is such a letdown.",2013
2,"I won't repeat the pertinent points already raised by other reviewers who hated Top of the Lake China Girl, but I want to add something I haven't seen anyone else mention, and that is that Puss/Alexander was just an amalgamation of G.J. and Matt from season one. This to me summarises how unimaginative and unoriginal the writing in China Girl was.",2017
6,"Season 1 was actually pretty good. Could've been shorter by at least one episode. Elizabeth Moss is quite good in it. The ending was a little bit strange. The series seemed unreal at times. Too many eccentric people floating around in the New Zealand bubble. The reveal at the end was kind of predictable. I guessed right by the third episode, but I couldn't figure out how it all came together. As good as most whodunit stories, but not nearly as good as the first season of Broadchurch, if you need something to compare it to. Mostly kept alive by the actors and the scenery. 6.6/10",2017
1,"9 pages of reviews, 6 of them are "" Hated It"" - what does that tell you. And I thought that most of the ""hated it"" reviews were quite kind. This is a truly dreadful piece, self indulgent, lazily written, stereotypes taken from the 70's. A man who is obviously psychotic ( Peter Mullan) and nobody seems to even mind, let alone try to avoid him, runs a drug laboratory beneath his home. The home, a rundown shack, is built on the side of a mountain - how does he manage to have a cellar which looks like something from NASA built beneath it....oh I could go on and on... so MANY of the things in this make no sense at all. A sexually abused and pregnant child is returned without any further question to her father and several older brother's who all live in the wilderness, no woman around. No police follow up or Social Care involvement. What? and so the plot lurches on, from one ludicrous scenario to the next. I gather from this that writer Jane Campion despises: men, the police, children (or at least pubescent girls),families and wives. She admires: women ( as long as they are abused AND strong,) nature, people with extremely strange sexual habits, and foul language. All in all, a total waste of time and money - believe in the reviews that read ""Hated it"". Incidentally, the HATE reviews all seemed to be written more in sorrow than in anger..",2016
8,"Come for the chilling performance from Scottish actor Peter Mullan, who is scary as hell, but has some fascinating vulnerabilities. Overall, real nice pacing with this mini-series. It unravels at a pensive pace, with just enough realistic twists to keep it believable. All the action has a a slowed- down feel. Almost dream-like. This series is very much about empowering women, and how men are perverted animals, but sadly, you only need to read the news to see that claim isn't much of a stretch. Hollywood should take note of Mullan and not pass up the chance to cast this guy in another villain role. There's nothing more terrifying than a sociopath Scot who whips himself in penance for some deep Oedipal shame. Give this series a chance, but know that it's slow and methodical. It's an uncomfortable ride with evil.",2013
4,"Poorly written. Decent acting. Can't blame the actors if they have nothing to work with. This a 2 hour movie idea stretched out to 6 and a half. Somebody please explain what the purpose of the women in the shipping containers?!? None of them added anything to the story. Especially Holly Hunter's. That entire subplot could have been left out and with a little rewrite it might have made a slightly OK mystery. However that's a great deal of the problem. There never is any real mystery. Even the characters don't seem to care what happened to the girl at first. And by the time they decide to start looking for her, you just want to stop watching. They really must like their drama without any down under. The sum of the parts just don't add up to a complete story. Suggest you pass on this one.",2013
2,"Look. I really tried to like Jane Campion's new TV series TOP OF THE LAKE (a bad sign in itself as you shouldn't need to try) but I gave up after 50 minutes when I thought to myself ""can I take another 5 episodes of this?"". ",2013
1,"Sadly I wasted 6 hours of my life on this dribble, each episode hoping that somehow it would improve on the last, watching till the very last episode hoping maybe it would redeem itself with an amazing twist to make the agony of watching the whole thing worthwhile. Nope, it didn't. Six hours of my life I will never retrieve. The scenery was the only redeeming feature of the mess. ",2013
2,"Top of the Lake earns a solid 8 for the cinematography, but a 1 for everything else. The show looks pretty, but in all other respects it's woefully bad.",2013
1,"i feel so moved by this as to make an effort to review, if only because at a glance so many seemed to think it was so good. First, i watched it all - yes, i wanted to see how it ended, and to prove to myself i was right from the word go. (i was) But just because a story is entirely predictable doesn't necessarily make it bad. That was left to the direction i guess, and the acting by basically everyone, though i have a soft spot for the old crazy (man - i am certainly not talking about the near pointless holly hunter character). No, i am wrong; there was some really lame story pacing as well, desperately trying to bring something together right at the end and i suppose realising the budget had been blown on long pauses with moody guitar picking. There were definitely elements of a good story in there, though you kind of feel they were the results of some awful first year drama students workshop where you 'brainstorm' with a sheet of a3 and some crayons. Oh my goodness! On and on and on. There is really nothing redeeming about this - i have enjoyed previous efforts by some members of both cast and crew - i hope they are all feeling just a little bit ashamed of this particular body of work. If you are thinking of watching, of course do. It will make you appreciate those other mini-series you've watched.",2013
5,"The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.",2013

4,Let me start by giving a summary of the book: A journalist travels the world AFTER the zombie outbreak to interview different people from different countries to see how they handled this massive infestation.

Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.",2013
4,If a film is sold by a trailer it's this one . I've never read the source novel but do know it is structured as reportage where the world has been changed by a zombie infestation leading to a new geo-political shape for the world so in many ways this is more of a prequel than an adaptation . I did like Danny Boyle's genre shattering 28 DAYS LATER and loved the sequel and unfortunately it looks like that franchise has ended so in some ways this could be a surrogate 28 MONTHS LATER . Add to this the trailers where the waves of infected storm barriers against heavily armed soldiers and we've got a Zombie classic in the making don't we ?No we don't because this is a film that gives the impression that it was written and made by zombies ,2013
8,"I was dubious! The rating, the early reviews, my love of gory George Romero movies had all led me to deciding not to see this. But, my wife wanted to go... Well, two breathless hours later I turned to her, big grin on my face and had to state ""That was awesome!"" Yes, I can see why people don't like it. It is very different to the traditional zombie movie, and very different to the book. But you know what, who cares - it's not a traditional zombie movie, or the book - it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! (And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books.) The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1) to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be, 2) that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids - I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that (not the gore) is what would scare them. 3) to go with the flow - I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun. I for one will be getting this on blu ray and I'll be first in line for any sequel. But I will admit, an undated version would be very welcome!",2013
1,"The zombie outbreak starts with Brad Pitt with his family in stopped traffic. There's a huge explosion with no explanation of why. Then, either a huge horde of humans are running from a small amount of zombies, or a huge horde of zombies are chasing a small amount of humans. You can't tell who is who, because all you see is a mob of people running in the same direction. Occasionally you see a zombie or two leap after a human, so you can tell they're not all human. But otherwise they could have been filming the bull runs in Spain (without the bulls).",2013

Brad Pitt's arrogance and feeling of self-worth will suffocate you as you watch this steaming pile of cr*p. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble the book, it was a terrible movie no matter how you slice it. Apparently Brad's artistic addition to the movie was that when humans become ill the zombies won't attack them...yet one of the guys who help Sir. Brad super-UN inspector Pitt only has an injured knee, not an illness. Brad Pitt is the only actor in this movie that has any real screen time, it might as well be called ""Brad Pitt saves the world (in the most uninteresting 2 hours ever).

1,"What a waste of money.... and I do not only mean for the tickets. The whole production must have been quite expensive. And I guess the taxpayer pays for all scenes where the US Navy or Airforce shows up? For what? The movie failed on all accounts and didn't even manage to create tension or scare people. The audience even started laughing in certain scenes. Uff I really don't know where to start: Satellite phones that work inside steel vessels, EMP kills electronics including satellite phones but only hours late they seem to be working again, amputations that don't cause the victim to bleed to death, kids that are totally cool after losing their families (high five!).... and i could go on and on. By the way the sponsors of the movie must have been Duct tape and Pepsi. The only creepy feeling i get is that movies like this or ""The Purge"" play a certain role to prepare society for future apocalyptic events. God bless America!",2013

First off, a zombie film watered-down and free from blood and gore? That idea alone would lose a big slice (pun-intended) of hardcore fans in the audience. How does it hold your attention then? By stringing you along on the edge with tension and suspense from beginning to end. It does a pretty good job of maintaining this grip even without the standard horror elements of slasher flicks.",2013

And what has happened to brad pitts standards....I guess he is only going downhill as far as his recent movies are concerned like killing them softly and this piece of sh*t.... Its a shame to the zombie movie franchise and does not even qualify to b on any sort of list of that sort not even from the bottom......hell I cant even complete the 10 lines necessary to write a review on IMDb but still I wanted to express my hate for this piece of sh*t that I certainly had to write this down.,2013
1,"This movie was walk out worthy. Anyone giving this garbage more than 3 of 10 stars either don't care about ridiculously intelligence insulting plot holes. For example: you are in a plane that crashes because a fight broke out with zombies. You happen to be flying over a country you have never been to. You promptly pull yourself together from the plane crash and walk directly to a ""secret research facility"" miles away to find the cure. This was supposed to be somewhat ""smart"" movie. But ended up being just dumb as Jurassic World which never set out to have an intriguing plot or mystery of any kind. I wish I could give this movie a 0.5 of 10. With budget and the source material they had to work with they did worse than I could have imagined. This movie is the ""walk out worthy"" category.",2015
1,"So I think everyone is aware this film has had a lot of troubles, and for those of you that weren't, you will soon see why if you waste you money, let alone your time on this excuse of a film.",2013
4,It seems unfair to criticise the film for not being like its source material given that it obviously didn't try to be but I'm going to start by bringing that up anyway. The book had so many sequences that could have been turned into amazing set-pieces in a film and yet not one of them were used. The book also had some neat ideas about how a global outbreak and response play out. What might work? What would catastrophically fail? What would the cost be? Not one of these ideas were explored or even alluded to and there seems absolutely no reason why this was the case.,2013
6,"World War Z is a zombie outbreak movie that supposedly bases itself on the amazing book of the same name by Max Brooks. What this movie truly is, is a shamefully mediocre attempt to create a movie that appeals to the widest audience possible. Pee established fan base from the book? Check. Star power (this is Brad Pitt)? Check. Focuses on intensity rather than horror and gore to not alienate non zombie fans? Check. Safe, young PG 13 rating? Check. All the makings are here because this is what the big Hollywood studio wanted. Despite the fact this movie doesn't resemble the book at all, it appears that those attached to make this movie tried to make a decent movie such as the visually interesting director Marc Foster who wanted to make a movie with a message which would emulate the tone the book was going for. However, the big studio disliked this and demanded rewrites and re-shooting that damaged the relationship between the director and Brad and results in a quick, intense action movie that lacks the character development and messages it needed to be a truly memorable movie because almost every one of those scenes were cut so much to the point that central characters get barley any lines. While the action scenes are intense and enjoyable on their own and Marc foster adds style to the lack of substance but its just not enough to save this movie. While it is better than it had any right to be thanks to Marc, it needs more and it lacks in crucial substance. However from the reviews and box office reports it appears Hollwood has succeeded in creating a successful marketable movie that everyone will eat up and it will be too late when we all get the nasty aftertaste.....",2013
7,"Finally, after years of facing difficulty with production and resources, World War Z has come our way, and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. ",2013
7,"""World War Z"", despite involving zombies, plays more to the likes of a disaster film instead of a zombie film. It's more of like ""2012"" than ""Resident Evil"". We see shots of cities tumbling down to the rule of zombies and the world slowly turns into a zombie wasteland. The zombie attacks are large-scale, grand, and extremely exciting, save for the climax which ends up as a small-scale sequence, but is equally satisfying. ",2013
1,"OK, i just finished watching. No WW Z is not good at all. I gave it on IMDb a (1/10).",2013
8,"I really love the cast for this, most of them are returning from the less well known web series ""burning love"" which was a spoof of the bachelorette type shows, also very good if you like shows like this. This one so far is not quite as spot on with its critique of reality TV but promises even more surreal wackiness, more in the vein of NTSF:SD:SUV or Children's Hospital, much of which the cast are also involved in. So its no surprise that this is already batshit crazy and full of eccentricities, i basically just watch everything they make recently because its bound to be hilarious. I wish June Diane Raphael played the part of the bitchy older girl, and the crazy blond one is a crackup but other than that the supporting cast are definitely a show stealer. David Wain is once again killing it as a foppish not-so closet homosexual. ",2015
9,"I almost didn't watch Another Period because I do not care for Natasha Leggero's humor (it's too catty and mean for me). But I find her character, Lilian, to be so hilarious and intriguing that I think I may now be a fan. ",2015
8,"I was expecting this to be Drunken History, which to me is a one- joke show. (We get it. You're drunk.) No offense to Drunken History fans. ",2015
8,This very silly show imagines Downton Abbey with the classy upper classes replaced by blithering idiots. ,2015
8,"I'm really enjoying this. It's dark champagne. It doesn't deserve comparison, but this is Julia Davis Lite, which works. It's reminiscent of Hunderby (a comedic satire of Jane Austen). Having a little of this with American nuance is exactly where I want to see things headed in Broadcast Comedy. If you like dark and irreverent British comedy, watch this.",2015
9,"Featuring broad comedy reminiscent of Monty Python, in part because it's a period piece, ""Another Period"" is about the Bellacourt family--one of the obscenely rich families that populated the cliffs of Newport, R.I. at the turn of the century, when Victorian values collided with entitlement and self-indulgence.",2015
7,"This isn't the best show to come out in a while, but it is surprisingly funny. The gags are pretty hit or miss, but when they hit, they hit hard, and when they miss, it isn't too bad. In many ways this reminds me of Children's Hospital - in that they've taken a genre (Edith Wharton/Downton Abbey/Victorian) and totally lampooned it. There's plenty of absurdist WTF humor as well as send up's of victorian society as a whole. ",2016
9,"I've watched a few episodes so far and it's hilarious. It's the same sort of over-the-top, don't-take-it-too-serious sort of humour as The Office was. I mean, it's Victorian era setting with Snoop Dogg intro music.",2015
6,"The true purpose of this show is clearly to expose the cruelty prevalent in turn of the century American High society. However, the fact that this has been done under the guise of high-drama is truly revolutionary. The intelligence & unadulterated talent needed to do this is gargantuan. May Wilde, Fitzgerald & Tolkien doff their proverbial death caps.",2015
8,Most comedy simply doesn't make me laugh. But there hasn't been an episode yet that didn't get a deep chuckle out of me. Not just a smile a nod but one of those deeply satisfying laughs that can change your day.,2015
5,"This was a show I really, really want to like and admittedly there are some chuckles in the first four episodes. However, the show itself suffers from a combination of poor writing and bad structure to really make it work.",2015
1,Within 30 seconds I knew this was going to be a bunch of normally talented people going way over the top and trying too hard..,2015
7,"So, I'll start off with the pluses. It's actually a period soap. Each character is well developed. Many of the jokes are built up in previous episodes, so there isn't much discontinuity.",2016
1,I was excited about this new series as I like Victorian Era shows. It's Supposed to be a comedy. Episode 2 starts right off with an aristocratic lady raping a servant man. His protest are mocking and belittling to real rape victims. Then he goes around with exaggerated sadness and mocking tears. Disgusting.I turned it off. I love comedies. Making fun of rape victims is not funny. It cruel and callous. Won't be watching anymore of this series. I'm quite surprised it has received good reviews and that no one has batted an eye at this. I wish more people would stand up and say this isn't right. Just another setback for those who have fought for justice. SMH.,2015

8,Ummm is this so bad its good? or so good its bad????? I don't know ... What I do know is your either going to love it or hate it OR like me who knows he should hate it but oddly love's it ... well i keep watching it ... and laughing ... so that means I like it doesn't it? OK OK so some are going to be really offended by some of the content so if you have suffered from any sort of abuse in the past its best you give this a miss So the question is do I recommend you watch it NO! and YES! hope you found this helpful..... Oh seems I haven't rabbited on enough to post this ... so this is just like Dooo Dow Duto oh Something or the other whatever Abbey ... NOT REALLY just waferling to fill up space.... I DON'T CARE IF YOU THINK THERE IS A SPELLING MISTAKE JUST LET ME POST IT ..... PLEASE!!!!,2015
1,"I don't know where to start, the overacting is beyond words. This must have been meant for the cartoon crowd. I normally don't take the time to dump on something, because someone thought to put in some hard work on this, but it was so bad I only lasted 10 minuets before I shut it off. I just didn't base it on that 10 minuets though, I did check out other Episodes for about as long as I checked out the Pilot. I guess when you only see two professional critics take a stab at a review, and one was in Spanish, then I should have known that critics also didn't want to take our time when something is this bad. I doubt we will see any follow-up seasons.....",2015
1,***Warning: rape mention***,2016
1,This is typical Showtime fair. We used to do a game called Disgusting Body Fluids. This show aims for comedy sketches revolving around every disgusting body fluid a human produces.,2016
9,"""Another Period"" is a strange reality show-like creation for The Comedy Channel. And, while I really enjoy it, I think it's a hard sell for its audience...which surprises me since normally developing a large audience is a must for television shows. The only way it would make sense is that someone in charge there loves the show and doesn't mind that it isn't all that popular. Considering they also make ""Drunk History"", this would make sense.",2018
6,"To say the show is rich with talent is an understatement. David Koechner is the family patriarch, underrated character actress Natasha Leggero lends her talents in a rare staring role as one of the two sisters (Riki Lindhome is also OK, although I feel she's better suited to be partnered with Kate Micucci), and Hamish Blake, Michael Ian Black, Brian Huskey, Paget Brewster and Brett Gelman are all excellently cast in character roles. Christina Hendricks (who's mostly known for period drama) dives into her role as a scheming servant with an unexpected amount of enthusiasm. Michael Ian Black is also one of those characters who sticks out (even in poor episodes) as a character who really puts the ""serve"" in ""subservient"" with the character of Peepers.",2015
7,Creators Natasha Leggero and Riki Lindhome have hidden real life issues in their overtly wacky and brash parody of Downton Abbey.,2015
6,"What had made Kick-Ass so special was its ability to sustain an interesting story both for the audiences who are and who are not willing to delve into the deeper aspects of what makes a film truly shine. Kick-Ass 2, on the other hand, seemingly aimed only to satisfy those who are not willing to dig. (But not entirely; I will get into that later). Simply put, if you walk into movies to see action, blood, and a whole lot of style, you will absolutely love Kick-Ass 2. However, if you walk into movies to see interesting characters, a well paced story, and a whole lot of substance, you will still admire Kick-Ass 2, but forget about it very soon. While there are few aspects from the deeper end of the spectrum residing within this film, that does not mean that they do not stand out and impress. Hit-Girl was a blast to watch in the first film. But unfortunately, her new-found sensitivities in this film seem to do nothing but take away from what mattered the most about her character in the first place in exchange for a few scenes of unnecessary high-school drama for the sake of developing a character in all the wrong spots. In spite of this, one character who stood out in a great way was Colonel Stars and Stripes who, in his mere seven and a half minutes of screen time, was an enormous bundle of interesting. Sadly, behind this among few more redeeming qualities lies the issues that many will have a hard time ignoring. The antagonist, who is notoriously known as The Motherf%#$er, is someone I found to be very bland and out-of-place in the Kick-Ass film universe created by the first film. Among a handful of humorous scenes he shared with Javier lies something we see every day in teenage comedies. Something worth forgetting about. Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is a great film for reasons that a lot of audiences do not find a film great for. However, if you allow it to take you to the spot it would like you to be (Which is a different mindset than what you had while watching the first) you should be in for a nice ride.",2014
3,"There's a scene in Kick-Ass 2 where one of Dave's only friends who hasn't quite got into the whole ""real life superheroes"" act yet finally joins them in an outfit that is basically an inversion of Dave's yellow-and-green jumpsuit and tries to choose his name. All he can come up with is variations like ""Ass Kick!"" and ""The Asskicker"" to which Dave and his other friend understandably roll their eyes. He later changes sides completely.",2013
9,"If there's one impression that Kick-Ass 2 left with me, it's this; This is one damn-fun movie, and a damn-fun franchise. ",2013
3,"Kick Ass is one of my favourite films. It's clever, funny, original and gets all of its various elements just right. It scores on every level and is in my view the very best superhero film there is. OK, it's not as good as the Dark Knight films but you know... it's different, it's self aware. It's the anti-superhero film par excellence.",2013
7,"I loved the first one and have been waiting for this with great anticipation! When I saw it on Comcast On-Demand I immediately rented it. Like most sequels, this wasn't as good as the first and it's hard not to make comparisons to the first movie. ",2013
2,"I am a huge fan of the first Kick-Ass movie; it was fun, action packed, and even had a few emotional sequences thrown in for good measure. I went into the sequel expecting the same feel of the first one to be present, but just a continuation of the story. That, unfortunately, was where I was horribly wrong.",2013
10,"I'm a huge fan of the first Kick Ass film and the comics, so I'm a tough fan to please but this film exceeded my expectations! In a year full of over-hyped superhero films Kick Ass 2 came along with a low budget, no contracted actors roped in and R rating and gave me the most entertaining hour and 40 minutes I've paid for all year!",2013
1,"Fiction is a vehicle capable of transporting the reader, the viewer across spaces fantastic, gulfs of the never before expected - indeed on a journey limited only by the fuel of storyteller's imagination. As readers of novel's, watchers of movies we fiction addicts have crossed some strange territory, toured places dark as they were fascinating. Thanks to the minds of writers and film makers, we've transcended death and lived scores of made-up lives alongside countless characters of every stripe and in doing so, often found some small unpolished gleam we'd overlooked in our own realities waiting for us after we've put down that page turner or exited the theater.",2013
9,"Kick-Ass 2 was definitely a film for the fans, if you aren't familiar with the Kick-Ass series then this movie wouldn't be for you. Having said that I am a fan of the comics and this movie was awesome. The fight scenes were crazy and Hit-Girl always runs the show. I hate that the critic scores are low but I honestly kind of figured they would be and I see why they made it so low, to a film's core this film wouldn't be looked at as a masterpiece, and they couldn't exactly retain the same shock factor the first one had because Hit-Girl was only 11 or 12 years old in it. But all things aside this was a pretty entertaining film and I think most people would really enjoy it.",2013
10,"There are so many things I'd like to say about this movie that I'm finding it difficult to choose what to begin this review with. Let's start saying that Kick-Ass is my favourite movie ever. A precious jewel of wit and originality, like no other movies. So I was truly worried, I feared that this sequel would disappoint me. Well, I've just come back from theatre and I'm right now feeling the need to review this M-Ass-terpiece before going to bed. Because Kick-Ass 2 is the main reason why I'm freaking enthusiast with life, now. ",2013
4,"Watching KICKASS was a pleasant experience which really had some kick- ass moments. Unfortunately , Kickass 2 tumbles down and is thoroughly disappointing. ",2013
8,"The first Kick-Ass film is one of my favourite films so I was delighted when I heard there was going to be a sequel. I didn't think it would be able to live up to expectations but it certainly did, it is a brilliant sequel. Both films are at least on par with each other.",2013
9,"When I saw this film was coming out, I could not contain my excitement. I enjoyed the first one immensely and was happy to see they were doing a sequel. Admitially I was a bit skeptic about the 2nd one, as most other films which I have seen that have been sequels, the 1st is usually always 10x better than the first one.",2013
1,"Let me start off by saying it doesn't deserve a 1, but i have to do what i can to balance out this undeserved rating. did we all forget how awesome the first one was? kick-ass 2 doesn't even come close. the entire film is one giant, ridiculous, cheese ball. ",2014
1,"I have been looking forward to this sequel for about 6 months. So imagine my disappointment after sitting through 2 hours of this complete rubbish. Reading through the majority of reviews posted about Kick Ass2, I'm beginning to think that some people were watching a different movie! It was a disaster from start to finish. The acting was poor and the storyline was very flimsy. It seemed to me that the movie was built around blood, guts, stunt fights and a pathetic attempt to show Mindy trying to be a normal tween. Any scenes that featured The Motherf**ker were ridiculous and cringe-worthy. The best character in the movie was the dog. I can understand why Jim Carrey walked away from promoting this movie. I would have left after 15 minutes if I hadn't spent 10 on the ticket.",2013
7,"Kick-Ass has defined itself as a superhero movie with heroes wearing silly costumes and little girls brutally beating up tough grown men. That piece of creativity has been appealed by many for smartly satirizing the genre, despite of some absurdity still existing and glorified in the action scenes. For that hype three years ago, here comes the sequel that still got the good old charms of its predecessor. The bigger difference now is the theme they are supposed to present seems tougher, but the action has also gotten strangely out of hand. While those upgraded elements can be a bit uneven, it's not really hard to enjoy the overall film since it's still quite hilarious and utterly entertaining. Although it only has little sincerity in its own message, there's no denying that Kick-Ass 2 is a lot of fun.",2013
8,"Despite the change of director, Kick-Ass 2 doesn't feel one bit different from its predecessor. It doesn't try anything revolutionary or groundbreaking, but what's here is very well executed and enjoyable. It's a prime example of how a proper sequel should be made.",2013
1,In March of 2010 a film by director Matthew Vaughn was released that took everybody watching it by surprise. This was a movie that people had so little faith in that it had to be independently funded and put together on a shoe string budget. This was a movie that held up a satirical mirror to a whole genre of movies and not only highlighted their weaknesses but also showed that genre how it was done. ,2013
1,"Kick-Ass was a pleasant surprise; Kick-Ass 2 is a big disappointment. Definitely not as good as the first movie... this time the jokes are not as funny, there are zero surprises in the plot. Creativity was left behind. Apparently the producers thought that the lack of intelligent jokes could be compensated by adding gross ""humour"": people throwing up and shitting all over the place. That's supposed to be funny?? I found the violence unnecessarily graphic: dismemberments abound, blood is shed as if it was nothing. And this is supposed to be a teen action comedy? There is no need to show all that gore... Showing it as ""casual"" makes it more consumable and that is actually a very questionable proposition!",2013
1,"First, let's do the real backstory, that is, the real world backstory. KA1 was a pretty interesting movie, with some nice ideas, some nice execution, and a decent plot arc. Arguably, the best thing in KA1 was Chloë Grace Moretz, who stole entire scenes from more seasoned actors with an impish grin and comic timing that Jack Benny would have envied. Ironically, since both KA1 and KA2 are about evil, you need to understand that the real evil happened after KA1 was made, when a new production team got hold of the rights to the sequel. Now, there are bad sequels and there are worse sequels, but the baddest of them all is a sequel that, from the getgo, seeks to exploit the vulnerabilities of its audience. And that's what we have here. Essentially a moronic story with episodes of violence bordering on the pornographic, interspaced with interesting (albeit undeveloped) secondary arcs that riff off, for example, MEAN GIRLS. To call this movie an abomination is unfair to real abominations. Through it all, however, Chloë Grace Moretz shines in her reprise of an older more mature Hit Girl, pretty much stealing every scene she is in - again. She is photogenic, athletic, charismatic, and knows how to deliver dialogue. We'll be seeing more of her.",2013
1,"If you enjoyed the whimsical idealism of the original Kick Ass, you'd better not subject yourself to this sequel, which is an altogether different beast. In fact, you'd better not watch this movie too close to mealtime. The profanity is jarring and continuous, with f-bombs about every 3 minutes, spearheaded by the idiotic name of the chief villain, ""Motherf***er."" The ultra-violence and ultra-vulgarity is reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino flick. There are dismemberments, decapitations, explosive vomiting and diarrhea, crotch-mauling dogs, etc. It is difficult to write a spoiler for this movie because the plot is so weak. Consider yourself warned and avoid this grisly turkey.",2013
1,"Jeff Wadlow's vile follow-up to Matthew Vaugn's enjoyable but ultimately escapist comedy Kick-Ass is every failure that Vaughn managed to avoid. While one could accuse Vaughn of sensationalizing violence and ultimately abandoning his own satiric point, at least Kick-Ass was anchored by strong performances, including a fantastic turn by Nicolas Cage. No such luck here. Moretz is a capable actor but she's given little to do. Her entrance into womanhood is presented with the tact of a bad teen soap and her ultimate conquest over her bullies is both tame and disgustingly underwhelming at the same time. Wadlow's ear is deaf and his tone loud like that of a child banging a drum. It's a retread that systematically destroys everything the original film had going for it. From it's characters, to it's performances, to ultimately the world itself. ",2014
9,"I just watched the pilot of Sleepy Hollow and was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it, I like the modern reboot of this classic story. I like the way they have taken the era in which the original Washington Irving story takes place, which gives a nod to the man and story itself and skillfully brings it into the modern day. ",2013
6,"Overall I feel this is an entertaining show with good casting even among the minor recurring characters. There are a few holes in the logic as far as Crane coming back from the dead and a LOT of holes with regard to how the police and day to day running of a town works, but I generally liked Sleepy Hollow. UNTIL... (spoiler alert read on at your own risk)",2014
2,"This season is AWFUL (at least so far). Not as awful as ARROW, which is downright unwatchable (worst acting on TV, and that's saying something). The series has definitely jumped the shark. Killing off Katrina was a crime. Getting rid of the great John Noble, boneheaded. Tom Mison and Miss Beharie seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. Monster-of-the-week is a seventies thing (The X-FILES barely survived it, but they had the mythology). Moving to Atlanta was ridiculous. The Colonial nature of the show is paramount, yet the producers would rather get tax write-offs than make a quality series. At least Buffy the Vampire Slayer had romance and lots of laughs for their (generally) MOTW formula. SLEEPY HOLLOW has definitely jumped the shark. R.I.P. Mr. Mison can now go back to doing Shakespeare ....",2015
2,"Sleepy Hollow is a modern retelling of the old Headless Horseman tale. In the Universe the series is set in, there is no tale. It just happens. There's magic and mystery, and so far pretty much all history between our Universe and the one of the series is shared (More or less, if you take into account the writers prerogative to ditch, maul or make up crap actual events). So, for all intents and purposes, with the exception of magic stuff, our Universes are basically the same! Now we have that out of the way, here's some other differences. Firstly, if a dude wakes up after being dead for 250 years, and also in incredible shape, in this Universe you cart him off to figure out how the Hell he did it. Here's a guy who fought with Washington! He is without a doubt the most forward thinking man of his age (Because I guess television doesn't like deeply or morally flawed main characters or something). The things he could tell you! An actual eye witness to the violent American revolution! A man who started the Boston Tea Party by accident! Instead, they just let him hang out with a police officer.",2013
9,"I saw some promo-pictures of this, and thought it looked nicely dark & grim, perfectly up my alley. Then I watch the episode and they start it up with a nice classic rock song! It set a really good mood for the rest of the episode, I got some heavy Supernatural vibes, only here the main protagonists are NOT two hot boys, but rather one man with a British accent who has awakened after being dead for 250 years, and a young black cop woman in the process of getting transferred to the FBI. The main cast had good chemistry, not in the romantic/sexual way, but more like the start of an interesting friendship. Which I appreciated! Too much forced romances these days. The guy's dead wife is kind of still in the picture, so I doubt there'll be any romance between the main cast any time soon. ",2013
1,I was really hopeful about this series when i heard about it. But boy was I disappointed! there are so many holes in the plot it isn't even funny. I have yet to come across a series so badly written as this. I watched three episodes and I couldn't sit through the fourth one. The dude who is asleep for like years wakes up AND DOESN'T CHANGE HIS CLOTHES. For all the three episodes I have seen. What are they? Glued to his body? How are they not deteriorating? How can people just miraculously walk out of mad houses and police stations? The heroine's sister is acting like she broke out of high security prison where she was kept in for mass murder or something. She's just delusional for heavens sake! ,2013
9,"I really wasn't expecting much of this show, but I wanted to watch it anyway since I love shows like Supernatural and Grimm. But man, I'm so glad I did watch. It's seriously amazing. I love that they included so much more than just the headless horseman idea. I was really having a hard time seeing how they were going to keep the show going, but after seeing the first episode, I have no trouble believing this show could go on for a while. I've never seen either Tom Mison or Nicole Beharie before, but both were amazing as Ichabod Crane and Abbie Mills respectively. I'm also pretty sure I saw Sebastian Roche as George Washington, but it's not listed on IMDb. If it was him, I'm hoping we see more of him in that role; he's one of my favorite actors. ",2013
10,"As soon as I heard about this new show, I marked it in my phone to remind myself to watch it. As a big fan of the supernatural, I was looking forward to this for a few months now. As a heads up, if you go into this expecting something serious and believable, well, just walk away now. It's meant to be entertaining, and boy is it ever. I thought this show was going to revolve around strictly the headless horseman..but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there's more involved, such as demons and whatnot. And as a huge fan of demonic movies such as Insidious and Sinister, I am now really looking forward to where this show takes us. I don't expect it to win any Emmy's or anything, but if you're bored on a Monday night, this is more than good enough to fill an hour out for you.",2013
6,"I'm writing this after seeing the pilot, and at least for a beginning it's nice. You like the characters, most of what's going on makes sense, and the characters are not making too many irrational decisions. In fact, the back story generally provides a fair degree of consistency for a series that is unabashedly supernatural. The Ichabod Crane character doesn't do too badly anachronism wise, which is refreshing after the number of times time shifted characters know way too much. ",2013
5,"The first season was surprisingly great. I thought with such a premise as this, it would undoubtedly be a trainwreck, but i was pleasantly surprised, i even felt the need to tell people how good it was after watching that epic season 1 finale. However it has only gone downhill from there to the point where after just 2 seasons it is a steaming pile of crap that i am no longer emotionally invested in. It started out as one of the few genuinely scary shows on TV, with its depictions of moloch and purgatory as the especially thrilling and well done parts. However it seems that over time, the talented crew of writers and animators that made the first season so great have been replaced by rank amateurs, and what was once poignant and well done is now campy and cringeworthy. Even the VFX are just... bad. Like at points almost scorpion king level bad. Pandora and the hidden one are the worst thing this show has ever done, and that includes that weird turning Ichabods witch fiancé evil for no apparent reason thing. And they celebrate it, as if the weird stupid shît they have done since their first season is something to be proud of.

8,"The television series Sleepy Hollow is very loosely based on a short story written by American author Washington Irving. First published in 1820, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' is the tale of Ichabod Crane - a school teacher who unsuccessfully competes with Abraham Van Brunt for the hand of Katrina, the daughter of a wealthy farmer. On the night of his rejection by the girl, he is chased by a headless horseman, and is never seen again. This leaves Abraham (who it is later implied was the horseman) to marry Katrina. ",2013
10,"I taped this before I had to go out to California for a funeral. A week later, on a boring Saturday evening I decided to watch the Pilot. It takes a lot to make me a fan, and within the first 15 minutes, I was hooked. Now, I have to add five more lines for my review to be submitted. Really? Watch Johnny Depp's Sleepy Hallow first (which was excellent), then watch this TV series. But only if you are not familiar with the story. It will allow you to compare and decide if you prefer a two hour movie or a weekly show. I like the psychic aspect of it and how people keep denying that these things happen. This is now getting down to the last show (they only made six shows to start out to test the waters), I hope this will continue because I love the script writers perspective and they keep it fast-paced. If every episode was a chapter in a book, then I'd keep on reading for the next adventure. I have had so many paranormal experiences that the only far-fetched thing I dismissed was the man who showed up in the future, and the Book of Revelations. I do not believe in the scary new testament stories, but it makes good script. Very entertaining! Enjoy the experience.",2013
1,"the first episodes of the first season were great and promising ,traveling through time and all the apocalypse thing made it interesting but like many other series it started to become more boring episode by episode! there are some reasons i will point out 1.if somebody came from centuries ago into 2013 he would become crazy and wouldn't be able to cope with the things he would see in this era,but our mr.crane seems to be very flexible blending and his reaction to the technologies he sees is very stupid and superficial! he has a cellphone with him and yet he wears shabby 200 year old clothes !! 2.the whole story only involves a demon willing to end the world by entering it ,this plot is for a 120 min movie not TV series! and all this happen in a small town! they try to drag the story by having some smaller demons like the headless guy riding around from time to time.now in the last episode crane finds his wife and she tells him she wants to stay with the headless man as a mole!! this is the most stupid version i could guess would happen! they want to drag this for i don't know maybe 6 seasons 3. no one in this town seems to ask about crane identity ! since when somebody goes around without being asked to show credentials?? everybody in town are OK with him wearing the stupid clothes and having no ID ! no one asks about strange things that happen in the town! in real world FBI would be all over the place investigating the strange and scary events! 4.every episode they make up some story about an artifact or some ancient object to drag the story ! and all of these objects are only found in this town!! like the whole American history has happened in this town! also they find a book about all of them! funny part: the books seem to be in a very good condition! despite being old....",2014

Except I thought Grimm was clever, and I found Sleepy Hollow boring and empty. I had too many why, and how questions that weren't answered. I missed the last 15 minutes because I couldn't take anymore. The writing is terrible. The acting is OK. The direction is terrible too. And don't say I'm hating, because if like then great for you. I am simply never going to watch it again. That's how I deal with things I don't like. I drafted this one review, and won't write another word of what I think.

Second the Asian cop almost killed Ichabod with his car then gets out points his gun at him and he is arrested, why was he arrested? He was no where near the scene of the crime and didn't even match the description of the headless horse man who was wearing a RED coat.

The movie is beautifully woven together into a magical and complete world of it's own. In which some people who saw the film lost themselves and found it frustrating, and others found a magical way of portraying the character's mind. I must admit, I am one of the latter.",2014
9,"Enemy is the latest thriller from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, and it stands as a hybrid mix of David Lynch and David Fincher at their very finest. Enemy follows Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) on a journey to find his exact lookalike named Anthony, a terrible D-list celebrity. As his investigation deepens, the mystery thickens and he is thrown into a fray way above his head. What works in Enemy is Gyllenhaal's fearless performance as a man who is searching to find who he really is. There are a couple scenes that he has where is truly riveting and it becomes so hard to take your eyes off the screen. It really is an explosive yet very contained performance that I feel needs a lot of recognition. Enemy marks itself as a film about identity and never knowing who you truly are and the pressures of wanting to become something you're not. While it remains as a heavy message, it still makes for a film that almost demands repeat viewings. At 90 minutes even, the film moves and never slows down enough for us to even breathe. Before we can even question what is going on in one scene, Villeneuve throws us another curve ball to contend with. While that may bring confusion to many people, it is very welcoming to a viewer in the mood to do some serious thinking. Anything beyond that, it may garner some negative responses especially if you're not paying close attention. Enemy works well as a psychological thriller, bringing some of the most disturbing images I've seen on screen in recent years. This film is NOT scary, but it is extremely uneasy and very creepy, especially towards the last twenty minutes of the film, which had me holding my breath as we finally discover the truth of what is going on.",2014
8,"Denis Villeneuve garnered a lot of attention for his mainstream success with PRISONERS, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, but it was it smaller, more obscure release that I wanted to see. ENEMY was released around the same time as PRISONERS but never saw a national release and I had to wait for the home video release to finally catch it. Watching it, I figured out why it never went mainstream. Most general audiences don't like something they can't understand, and ENEMY is probably best described as a mental cluster fumess. It has a surface plot that's easy enough to understand but the film is loaded with symbolism and deeper themes. Most of which can't be discussed without entering spoiler territory so I won't touch on it much, but this is a movie that inspires discussion orat the very leastwill leave you contemplating it long after it ends. I know my first viewing led to two days of thought trying to decipher what I'd seen and it wasn't until I scoured the Internet, reading over the frustration of others and the myriad of proposed meanings, that I felt I'd come to an understanding. But that's me and my obsessive nature, and others can do their own research. On the surface, ENEMY is about history teacher Adam Bell (Gyllenhaal). Adam is suggested a film from a work colleague that he might enjoy and becomes obsessed when an extra in the film looks exactly like him. He tracks the actor down, Anthony (also Gyllenhaal), and discovers they're physically identical in every way. And then it gets weird.",2014

For those who remain under the spell of Saramago's strange and seductively intelligent writing this film will satisfy. For those who prefer linear story lines of everyday possibilities the film will likely not find an appreciative audience. This is a film that demands the full attention of the viewer and the acceptance of alternative ways of viewing reality and alternative reality.",2014

A year later, with the release of Enemy, the impact Villeneuve has left doesn't seem to be anything that will die down any time soon. Reteaming with his Prisoners star Jake Gyllenhaal, Enemy proves Villeneuve's versatility by telling a mind-boggling mystery with stunning twists and turns, deep hidden meanings, and a tremendous double performance by Gyllenhaal.",2014
7,"Denis Villeneuve, whose last two films were the hugely impressive Incendies and Prisoners, has concocted a real oddity here. If you can imagine David Lynch adapting a Kafka novel, then you will be in the right neighborhood! In Incendies and Prisoners,Villeneuve inserted serious moral and social issues in the context of first rate thrillers' Here he follows the same tradition but the tone is more abstract and absurd. Neverherless, Enemy, adapted from a novel by the Nobel prize winner Jose Saramago, is always gripping and totally fascinating. A man (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets a recommendation from a colleague to watch a particular video. The main actor in the video appears to be his doppelgänger and the two agree to meet. To reveal any more would lessen the enjoyment of this highly original film. Well worth catching.",2013
9,"A previous review by Andrew Ellington has thoughts about ""Enemy"" that echo my own. Ellington's incisive observations about ""...the struggle for self-identity..."" are, I believe, the key to the power of the film.

10,"Watching this film, knowing little to nothing of what would find me, turned out one of the most pleasant film experiences in months. And perhaps it might be necessary to explain 'pleasant' here: the word does not necessarily mean that one is comforted, has fun in the usual meaning. Film-wise it means, at its best, to be challenged. Challenged, here, meant to be glued to the screen. It's a little difficult to write a review on it. I've read through some of the others and saw that almost all reviewers had problems. Some were trying to solve the riddle (the more confidence displayed, the less successful they were). Perhaps it's best to paraphrase what one of the reviewers wrote: try and go through this film as if through a dream, through reality enhanced. Enhanced reality feels very much like the opposite, and this is the feel of the film. From the choice of colours to acting to ambivalence about identity, the result is as hypnotic as it's unsettling. The very simple story is told very plainly, but underlying is the intricacy of a nightmare. The discomfort feels like a single, stretched emotion. Something about this film works wonderfully, and as with the best of literature that narrates between the lines I wasn't always able to tell why (that went the same way for me with the spider-theme: it worked before I understood). The music is an inseparable part of the film. The film wouldn't have been the same with another soundtrack, a large part of what works in it isn't merely carried by it, but co-created. Pleasant also, albeit in a more common sense, to be finally able after quite some time to give a best vote for an achieved fusion of everything that makes a film for the viewer, unsettling, challenging and deeply rewarding. 10 out of 10 Theraphosae.",2014

Denis Villeneuve's Enemy, a psychologically-charged mystery that's more thoughtful than thrilling, explores the idea that there's someone else in the world who shares your face but has, seemingly, nothing else to do with you.

A lot of people gave it a high rating - they belong to the pseudo intellectual crowd, probably influenced by the rackets that are postmodernism, post- structuralism and of course semiotics. People who know something about movies gave it a low rating - they are the 'call a spade a spade' crowd. The movie was slow, and the subject matter, well just boring. Why make a movie about a comfortable middle class professor and his trying to forget his past lover when there are so much more interesting things happening in the real world today.

It could have been a good thriller if the story line was a little better and they made Jake a little more believable and personable.

The comedy was superb and I must say even though this is completely fan-made Chris does great work with what he has. There is always room for improvement (as with anything that is barely starting out) and I'm sure that if given enough time this series can become even better. I've seen other Deadpool fan films/series and this series by far surpasses them all. I was so excited to watch episode two after I had seen the first one.

I haven't read ANY Deadpool comics but after seeing this show I want to read these and others to see what I've been missing. Just really interesting and extremely well made.

The first episode blew my mind. I don't think I ever thoroughly enjoyed anything in regards to comics or superheroes of any kind as much as I did that first time. I laughed so hard at times I had to rewind the video to hear it again. I absolutely loved the campy feel of it and how amazingly well made it was. Fan films catch a bad rap but this is worth every single second of watching. You won't regret it if you just take the time to appreciate all the details involved and the passion everyone has for it.

What I like best about the web-series is that while it is based off a comic book/comic book character, this is a real world adaptation of them. In the real world for example, a Deadpool mask with just white over the eyes on the mask may not work well when it comes to fighting and just overall vision. There wasn't an over-usage of caption boxes and there wasn't an over-usage of breaking the fourth wall, which is something can easily and has been overdone in other fan films. As a fan of the Deadpool comics pre-Deadpool return via Secret Invasion, I definitely suggest that fans watch this; and if you aren't a Deadpool reader, I think this series would get you interested in the comic book series.",2013

The fight scenes are well choreographed and shot at dynamic angles! The fact that Deadpool web-series had made #1 is no surprise.

1,"There is a lot that needs to be changed to make this a better fan film. Trying to pass it off as a real film is sad. Granted there is some good fan films out there but this is not one of them. I am a huge movie buff and comic reader and this did nothing for me. The humor was so off from Deadpool, I am not sure if the writer as read all of Deadpool's comics. I figure if your going to do a movie based on a character do your research. And if you did, damn you missed the mark. Deadpool's humor is over the top but he doesn't try as hard as the character in the film. The costume looks like the same kind I see at comic con every year. And really? Contacts? The voice over work can really be noticeable. The way it is dubbed in sounds bad. I think some scenes the voices were higher than others. The acting. Boy where do, I start. It is just bad. I know this is not professional but you could at least looked for better candidates. Now all that was bad but the worst was the story. I know it is a series but good god follow a format. There is not pace at all. We meet the lead and then run into garbage. There is no meat on this boneless video. Deadpool is very fun, fast paced comic but this video turned him into a cartoon joke. I will have to pass on episode 3 if no changes were made. I was drawn to this because I am a huge indie film fan and of course love Deadpool. I recommend watching 'Grayson' to get a better feel of the proper way to portray comic characters on a limited budget.

Tom Cruise is the perfect man for the lead role, and does not fail to deliver a good performance. If you are a relatively simple person with a short attention span you may become a bit dazed and confused as to why certain components of the film are occurring, but it adds up in the end beyond measure. Although 'Oblivion' forces you to work slightly harder than usual in understanding the plot and each twist that it takes, it all comes together very well in this thrilling yet slightly confusing film.

It is a Sci-Fi movie with a human heart, so you don't need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise addict, but he does a great job in his usual way. In fact, all the actors portray their characters very well.",2014
3,"Let me start by saying that the visuals in the movie are great, acting is reasonable, and although the general story is slow, it has a lot of potential. That is where the positivity ends. For me, the abundance of plot holes / inconsistencies completely ruined the film. Whilst some of these might seem like nitpicking, when you add them together it really detracts from what could have been a great movie. I was asking questions like;",2013
8,"Here's a fine example of a film that may have an inconsistent and a familiar screenplay, but still makes up for an exciting watch due to its director Joseph Kosinski's extra-ordinary sense of creating spectacles that feel like breathing artworks. The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film- Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although, you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!",2013
9,"Granted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics,  granted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it  lets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but  there is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and  probably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life,  Spielberg aside.  A long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and  the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the  moon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis.  Nuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the  surviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien  scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the  earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by  drones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a  stylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out  memories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea  Riseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is  this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have  haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won  the war?  ""Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you  never lived?""  Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am  legend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix  and of course, WALLE to create a striking, visually resplendent  feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda  creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and  visual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked  with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush,  unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not  overpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt  with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a  dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct  inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As  revelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal  fussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes,  check. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the  icy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an  essentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual  solid self in a cameo.   Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the  proceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid  bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum  up, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well  written and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red  hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of  Roxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and  enjoy a summer spectacle.",2013
8,"The new film from the director Joseph Kosinski who directed 2010's Tron Legacy, has two things going for it, his brilliant visual style and a brilliant score this time provided by M83 rather than Daft Punk who scored Tron Legacy. The film is rapturously beautiful, it was filmed with 4K cameras which is definitely the way in which to see it as it was stunning. The film stars Tom Cruise who can make anything watchable (as he did with Knight and Day, barely) and he brings a familiar face for somewhere completely foreign territory, as the world has been devastated by a war for earth. He is joined by Morgan Freeman who does not feature as much as the poster would have you believe, also Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. The best thing about the film is the action which works very well and we have a Texan Melissa Leo at mission control who is a figure of mystery and plays to some of the more interesting parts of the film such as who creation and the feeling of home, which Cruise does. The film has the tag-line ""Earth is a memory worth fighting for"" and this film is definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen with the best projector possible.",2013
8,"You will benefit a lot if you do not watch the trailer I noticed. The trailer shows too much and it makes the obvious twist in this movie even more so obvious. First lets go through the cast. Tom Cruise did an excellent job as Jack and Olga Kurylenko also delivered as Julia. Their chemistry worked in the movie and I believed in their part of the story. But other actors chiefly Morgan freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Kingslayer in Game Of thrones) were criminally underused and had just a few bits of dialogue. It would have been better to cast lesser known actors to fill their role. The story itself is very interesting yet as most people will notice, highly predictable. Still there is enjoyment in this film since it is very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are top notch. I was never bored during the movie and there are some plot twists that surprised by the time I was done watching. It might not be the summer blockbuster you were waiting for but you will not go out of the movie theatre disappointed!",2013

Super performance by Tom cruise,Olga Kurylenko,Andrea Riseborough and of course Morgan freeman.",2013

9,"Just finished watching the film for a second time through. First time through at an extreme screen cinema and the second at home. At both locations the film was fantastic in terms of visual and sfx. The film was very well directed with a range of creative and visually pleasing shots and film techniques. The storyline itself was great with plenty of exciting twists and turns in the storyline. Admittedly, the first hour is not as exciting and the second - however it worked to explain the storyline which was one of the greatest aspects of the film. Definitely a must see - even after my second viewing I was able to enjoy and learn more about the film.",2013
7,"Dear IMDb readers, Up to this day, I've never bitten of nails like in this movie. It wasn't boring though it was 124 minutes long. I enjoyed it fully till the end. I was surprised that this story was so intriguing and was sort of a mystery/""have to think"" movie. I thought this would be not as good as it was. It exactly showed me the movie I needed after a long day of school. I found this at least a note-worthy movie which has a chance to be in the top 5 2013. I hope others will love it too. I know they will. This is the movie the world needs. This is one to remember.",2013

1,"This movie simply wasn't funny. It dragged on interminably, scenes with little comedic value got dragged out for far too long presumably because the directors (and main featured actors) were too high while making this steaming pile of wasted time.",2013
1,"This was perhaps THE worst movie I've ever seen. Perhaps my wife and I are simply too old for the subject matter (50s), but sex-oriented jokes, drug use, and constant use of the f-word do not a humorous movie make - and we are not prudish people, particularly my wife. I think I smiled once, and I heard my wife giggle once, but I was as close to walking out of a movie as I've ever come. I doubt there was much of a script involved, and my guess is that all of the actors were told to ad-lib the nastiest sex joke that could get an 'R' rating they could think of. I mean a five minute scene about ejaculating all over someone's house...??? Hardy-har-har. I now hate Danny McBride even more than I did before this garbage, and what the hell was Emma Watson thinking.",2013
1,Horrible; in my opinion.,2013
3,"I feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else. It's simply not funny, I think I laughed once. We really don't need to see a erect, giant, detailed, graphic phallus in every movie, it's not funny. Then to have to sit through an extended portion of Satan walking around with his junk out is not funny and not needed. I'm not prudish but this movie adds male genitals just to do it, it was a lame movie. Write something creative like 40-year old virgin. This movie was lamer than Pineapple Express and Your Highness. If you expect the wit of Knocked Up, you'll be as disappointed as me. Save your money. ",2013
9,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not ""just like"" any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.",2013
1,"I went in to this movie today expecting to laugh hard. I have been a fan of Seth Rogan, James Franco and all the rest so I knew what kind of comedy to expect. I found the first couple of scenes funny but then the movie just took a nosedive. I get that they are poking fun at their lifestyles, but is Rogan boasting to the world that he's a pothead? And if Michael Cera doesn't really snort cocaine, then why on Earth would he want to portray that he does?? These aren't characters that they are playing, they are playing themselves in this film. So this movie tells me that these people are immature drug obsessed morons, and it is a real shame that people like this get paid incredible salaries when so many real good people are out there slaving on minimum wage. I know some people may think I've over-analyzing this but I'm not. In a movie where the actors portray themselves, I'm personally stunned that they willingly participated in a movie where not only aren't they selected to get in Heaven, that they continue to act like immature imbeciles (especially McBride) in a time of biblical apocalypse. And one last note, anyone that finds images of a man's junk everywhere hilarious, really has some maturing to do. If I could give this movie no stars I would. I really am upset I wasted money and time on this one.",2013
7,"Although 'This is the end' does not have the greatest storyline in the history of film, it is a very inventive movie in its own way. The fact that every actor and actress plays him or herself makes the movie quite original and refreshing. Besides that, there is also the fact that the makers took an overused theme, the end of the world, and made it completely their own.",2013
7,"I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. I loved the idea of using the actors' real names but creating alternate personalities. The humour is great, and special effects are rather realistic! Also, I particularly loved Michael Cera and Paul Rudd's appearances! Great job to the writers, directors and actors. For me, this was the perfect combination of comedy, horror and sci-fi. There was a sense of doom throughout, especially with the wide shots of LA, which made me feel quite uncomfortable, but then there was plenty of comic relief. ",2016
1,This was without a doubt one of the most disappointing movies I went to in 2013 and I go to a lot of movies. I saw the previews and like the fact that Seth and his buddies were going to play themselves. All I can say is the movie had a handful of funny scenes but had way too little comedy overall for what I was expecting. It was also a movie with a lot of blood and some of the writing just looked like they were smoking pot when putting this together. ( for all I know that might be what Seth and company had in mind).,2013
4,"I had heard good things from friends about this and I kind of wanted to see it. So I decided might as well go see it. Before I saw what I am about to say, I am a huge fan of almost all the movies these actors have made.

I went to see this with my parents last night...now, I am in my 30, my parents are in their 50's, and we all loved Your Highness and other movies that some of these actors are in separately. Franco and McBride can be hilarious, but this was far from their finest moment. Seriously, we collectively laughed 4 times. I kept count. The only reason that I am giving this a 2 and not a 1 is that there was a scene where some large 4 legged demon came launching into the scene and my mother jumped and dumped half her candy.",2013
1,"This is seriously one of the worst movies ever made and I feel compelled to tell all who is just thinking on spending a dime on this useless movie if you can even call it that - don't do it!. Only good thing about the movie was Michael Cera who had approx. 2 mins all in all. (Funny stuff by him), but as a movie it sucked in every category imaginable; script, acting, special effects....the list is long, too long for me to even have the energy to continue this review. But I will say one last thing and that is 'how the hell is it possible to get the rating of 7.1'? IMDb should really soon create some sort of ghost-review detection, because no way in hell would this movie get above 3 avg. If someone had not boosted it with multiple tens. Cant believe it - create a shitty movie with well known actors and get away with it by tricking the audience on IMDb. Robbery in broad daylight if you ask me.",2013
8,"I was actually surprised that it was better than I thought it was going to be. I think too many movie-goers hyped it up in their heads that this movie was going to be the most epic comedy of all time. I went in knowing how dumb it was going to be and found it really funny at parts and I liked the dark comedy eased with more immature slapstick comedy. A lot of these negative reviews I've read either have some kind of religious agenda against this movie or were people trying to measure how big their cinema knowledge penis is by citing great foreign films and comparing how much it falls short. It's a stoner comedy made by stoner nerd's that happened to find success and are probably just as baffled as these harsh critics are as to how they achieved it. In a movie filled with celebrity cameos and over the top CGI and humor, it felt to me like it was still a down to Earth movie they probably spent 30 minutes writing and had a blast filming and getting friends together and showed Hollywood excess from the point of view of the outsiders. If you were offended or wrote this movie off because it wasn't up to your standards, you're not the audience this movie had any intention of appeasing. It's obviously a cult comedy that some will love and most will hate which sometimes are the best comedies. It wasn't quite up there with the writer's and actor's other modern day classics but it was totally enjoyable and worth watching again.",2013
1,"Avoid this movie at all cost, it is the biggest waste of 1.45mins Celebrity cameos will draw a lot of people in, but most of the real famous people are killed in the first ten mins of the film starting. The rest of the 90min film is downwards from there, It's not funny, not interesting and is just plain awful. Has moments that will remind you of Little Nicky, which itself is awful too, but even if you found that movie entertaining in any way, its still a million times more awful. Sometimes films are so bad it's funny, and this probably was the purpose of the film, but it couldn't even do that properly, it was just plain awful. This film was only made to get the stars on screen and try to make it big at the box office, while celeb cameos and an OK trailer will draw you in, don't be fooled, it truly is one of the most awful films ever made.

9,"Was lucky enough to see a preview of this tonight, and can recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, modern and silly yet at times shocking comedy. Not sure how it can have a score of only 6.4 at the moment, the film is easily the best comedy of the year so far and deserving of an 8 or my case a nine as i was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the jokes and the story.",2013

One of the girls sitting in front of me stated, ""well it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good either"", which I thought summed it up pretty well. The biggest shock was that it had a 7.9 IMDb rating which normally indicates a potentially ""great"" movie in any category--especially a comedy. (anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what I consider a GOOD movie).I give it a 5.5 or maybe 6. THere were several other movies in the same theater with lower IMDb ratings that, in retrospect, I wished I had spent my time and money on.",2013
4,"Here's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched it five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through their reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar additions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of adolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a nod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What could go wrong?",2013
5,"I kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with robots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the world as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely connects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete loss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that was the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even remotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that an insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything other than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really funny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.",2013

7,"Saw it at a midnight premier last night (free Cornettos were given out!) and myself and the rest of the audience were laughing throughout, having a thoroughly enjoyable time. I thought it was great, definitely on a par with Hot Fuzz, though - to me - not quite as good as Shaun of the Dead, which is fair enough as it is one of my all-time favourites. It is definitely a worthy close to the ""trilogy"" though, and it stands up well against the other two.",2013
8,"Good comedy. I think that director of this movie Edgar Wright knows what he's doing, he has style, he has his actors, he has his sense of humor. I really enjoyed this movie, although my girlfriend said it was only an average film for her. So it depends on what you like. If you already saw Shawn of the Dead, you might know what to expect in this one too. Crazy, non logical actions, a lot of irony about mankind and life in general! But in the end, movie tells us that traditional values of life are irreplaceable - family, friends, life purpose, to know who you are. Because in the end, only these matters.",2013
8,"The movie-making team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade. With ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007), the trio demonstrated originality, ingenuity, and most significantly, capable of drawing a large, appreciative audience. Now they're back with the long-awaited third movie of what's become unofficially known as the ""Cornetto trilogy."" Like it's predecessors, director Edgar Wright loves paying homage to American cinema; ""Shaun"" pays its respects to George Romero, ""Fuzz"" nods its head to over the top action, buddy flicks, and ""World's End"" takes a page from our classic American sci-fi films.",2013
9,"I didn't think this trilogy could get any better. However it somehow exceeded by expectations. With fantastic direction from Edgar Wright,smart writing from Wright and Simon Pegg and hilarious performances from Pegg, Nick Frost and everyone else the World's end is a great way to end the trilogy. The story focuses on a group of childhood friends who go back to their hometown in order to repeat a legendary pub crawl that ends with a pub known as the World's End. However they realize that their whole town has been taken over by robots and it's up to them to stop them from taking over the world. I will admit that my only criticism of the film is that it does start off a little slowly. The jokes felt a little stiff at times with their execution and most of the humor was coming from Pegg's character. However once the robots come in the movie does pick up the pace and lives up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The performances are very funny with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually switching roles. Pegg is more of the bumbling idiot whereas Frost is the straight man. The other performance are also good with Martin Freeman,Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan. I also loved the ending which has probably the best ending out of any of the Cornetto trilogy movies Overall the movie is incredibly funny despite having a slow start. It's a perfect mix of comedy and science fiction. I hope there's more to come from these very funny and talented guys.",2013

9,"The Cornetto series continues with nothing short of what you'd expect from Wright, Pegg and Frost. Delivering top laughs with great action and a little bit of romance to suit all audiences. The film's visual style is quite appealing. The only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional (being robots). The style of violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a fun comedy with nothing to pick on whatsoever A top film just like the others!",2013

10,"The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End,' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.",2016

6,"Nine years after director Edgar Wright and comedic duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost teamed up for zombie p*ss-take Shaun of the Dead and six years on from their buddy-cop parody follow-up Hot Fuzz, comes the long awaited finale of this thematic trilogy (known by most as the ""Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy""). Part three turns its attention to sending up the alien invasion flick as a bunch of ex-school mates get together for a pub crawl but are ultimately forced to fight for their lives against a passive-aggressive race of blue-blooded androids. Sounds bonkers? That's because it is. Hilariously so? Unfortunately not. Where Shaun and Fuzz were actually quite clever in their humour and drew out consistent belly laughs, The World's End seems unrefined and rushed; the gags are more smile-worthy than laugh-out- loud. It also feels forced, both narratively and emotionally. The friendship between Pegg and Frost in their previous Cornetto outings (as well as with their American adventure Paul) was utterly genuine and subsequently generated an affection to go along with the comedy, however the relationship here is too overt in its efforts to gain poignancy and doesn't earn it as a result. Despite it's many flaws, there is still a plethora of reasons why fans will get their kicks though. Firstly, the leads have wisely surrounded themselves with terrific actors including Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Rosamund Pike and - with a show-stealing turn - Eddie Marsan, whilst the cartoonish violence is again highly entertaining and a bathroom-set rumble that pays loving homage to The Warriors is one of the best brawls of the year. By no means a failure, but waiting for the DVD wouldn't be a bad option.",2013

I didn't really know a lot about the film aside from seeing a couple trailers here and there and hearing customers blabber on about how excited they were for this movie (I work at a movie theater). I guess the concept sounded kind of interesting, and really, I just felt like seeing a movie I hadn't seen yet. My expectations were blown away; the movie was worse than I had originally assumed.

5,"The idea is intriguing. For twelve hours a year all crime is legal, including murder; do what you want and face no consequence. All emergency services are suspended and with the exception of an unexplained restriction on weaponry, and certain members of the public being out of bounds as targets, there is nothing to stop you doing what you wish. The result is a venting of frustration and anger, a purging of demons, as well as the eradication of the poor and those unable to defend themselves. The end result of this annual purge is extremely low unemployment and crime, and a fantastic economy; ""a nation reborn"", where the weak are prey and the strong survive. One of the strong is James Sandin, who sells security systems to fellow high-flyers; these obviously come in most useful on the night of the purge. Of course on the night in question, things go rather wrong and the Sandin family find their home under siege, following their son Max's generous act of letting a victimised stranger in.",2013

""The Purge"" takes place in the United States, a country founded upon violence through the Revolution, savage dealings with Native Americans and Africans, and incessant involvement in wars throughout the world.

9,"This is my first review on this website and i feel like the purge deserves one because the film truly keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the full run time. (contains mild spoilers) The first half of the film generally annoyed me because the dad is the only likable character and everyone turns against him.. Considering the concept of the purge is an annual day of survival/crime.. you'd think the family would be used to not letting people in when they say 'please, help me' and that the son would know the high security password the locks down the whole house.. never mind that. At this point i was quite disappointed as i really enjoyed the concept of a 'Purge day' and it felt like the idea wasn't given full justice.",2014
1,"my main issue with 'the purge' is the utter unbelievability of the entire premise. all crime is legal for 12 hours? this is supposed to reduce crime the rest of the year by giving people one night per year to vent? if your house were invaded and destroyed by the neighbors; and members of your family were killed in the name of 'the purge' i doubt you would have a very good time at the next culdesac barbecue. you would be enraged. and the next purge, what would you do? go on your own rampage? where does this cycle end? here's what you could do: go rob a bank; or empty the lottery ticket bins at the nearest 7-11. if anyone tries to stop you, shoot 'em. crime is legal after all. go kill all your co-workers. no stupid project to go back to. see where this is going? 12 hours is enough time to devastate society. their only disclaimer in the film is you can't use specific weapons above a certain rating; and you can't go after government officials. it doesn't say anything about your boss. why not wipe out your rival businesses. now you're a monopoly. how about killing off the rival sports team? league champs! there's so many things that would go wrong with 'all crime is legal for 12 hours' that it would NEVER EVER be implemented as an actual law. and this thing was supposed to be in 2022. thats 8 years from now, and that was with it already in place a few times. come on. what you have here is some twisted writers genocide fantasy. how can you reduce poverty and unemployment? kill off the impoverished and unemployed. problem solved. really? this movie sucked in every way. it doesn't make any sense. the boyfriend scene? how does that work? why does the angry mob waste their precious 12 hours trying to go after 1 guy, when they can go wipe out all the 'swine' they want? why not drive up to canada; or Mexico for the night? why even be home that night? NOTHING about this makes any sense.",2014

4,"I watched this movie against my better judgement. Most of the reviews on IMDb rate this movie somewhere between awful and horrible. I was hoping that maybe they were being too harsh, they were not. I made the mistake of thinking that Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke were both credible actors. (I love Headey as the evil queen in Game of Thrones) whoever wrote her dialog in this mess should be drawn and quartered. By the end of this movie I was actually hoping that the ""good guys"" would get killed just to keep them from having to suffer this script anymore.",2013
6,"I am a movie theatre employee, so I saw this film last night at an employee screening. Going into the movie, I was rather excited. The concept is interesting, and has never been done before. While this movie was not as scary as I had anticipated, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The antagonists were disturbing, and the movie really shows the struggle between self-preservation and what's right. It is somewhat short, but the makers certainly do get the job done. Plenty of flashlight-and-pistol standoffs and suspenseful scenes make for a movie with an interesting plot, and good acting. The ending was a bit predictable, but did not ruin the movie in my opinion. Not the best that I've seen, but overall a decent flick.",2013
1,"A Re-hash of so many similar Movies - family trapped In house fighting for survival. The reasoning behind the 12-hour Purge Is never satisfactorily explained,other than It's a short period once-a-year during which there are no laws and everyone can do has he or she sees fit. Rather than huge Gangs causing havoc - race-war,religious war,etc, as one would expect - Instead,It's neighbour-on-neighbour. Quite how this release of pent-up animalistic anger makes for a good America(Including unemployment down to a mere 1%)we shall never know. Everything takes place Inside the one house and we are fed the usual ""walking-around-slowly-In-the-dark-with-flash-lights"" routine. Yeah,how fresh and unique! A ridiculous premise and lousy script made bearable by some pretty decent acting. Sadly,we are left still waiting for that special little something that never happens. Massive anti-climax. Don't bother watching unless you've no paint to watch drying!BLOOPER.....The guy Is tied up In the chair with the duct-tape down from his mouth....In the next scene,where he tips the chair over,the tape Is back around his face!And directors get paid tens of thousands or more for missing obvious mess-ups like that!",2013
7,"THE PURGE  I have been waiting to see this movie for quite a while now. I saw the  trailer a while ago and loved the idea. This is a highly anticipated  movie for me.  America is a peaceful country since a new law has been introduced for  one night a year, all crime is legal! The police, ambulance and fire  services are not available for 12 hours. So during that night, as you  can imagine is hell. The whole country has turned into a riot murder,  rape, arson, robbery you name it it is happening and is legal. One  wealthy family lock their house down with really high tech equipment  and everything is fine during the night of purging until the young son  hears someone screaming for help and decides to open the security to  help him now their house is targeted by a large group.  It is a very good thriller and it did not disappoint. There were a few  moments where it was very predictable I saw a few of the moments  coming before they happened but there were also a few surprise  moments. The ending is really good too.  The movie stars Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane  & Edwin Hodge. Everyone did a great job in their roles but the only  problem I have is with Lena. She did a great job in this, but  unfortunately I think she has been typecast as a bad person. I have  seen her in Game of Thrones & Dredd and she plays a mean bitch in both  of them and she plays it well. I just didn't quite believe she was the  housewife victim she was portraying in this movie. But the star of the  movie for me was Rhys Wakefield. He played the leader of the group  outside and he was great. The way he played the character was actually  really polite and nice, but with a very mean streak. I thought it was a  nice touch and he did a brilliant job.  The action is great and there are some nice twists. Seeing as the whole  movie is set in one house, it gives it a sense of entrapment. You don't  get bored either it has a great suspense about it.  Excellently shot and well made. I am so glad that this highly  anticipated movie was not a disappointment for me. I was hoping to see  it in the cinema, but I missed it apparently it was in the cinema for  only a week. It didn't have enough publicity really this film deserved  a lot more publicity as I believe it would have been more popular that  it is.  I will give it 7 out of 10.  ""Incoming reports show this year's Purge has been the most successful  to date, with the most murders committed.""",2013
4,"The subject of Man still being just a killer animal deep down is one that has fascinated writers throughout the ages, and increasingly in the modern world, where we in the West have achieved a lifestyle of such mundane safety and freedom from risk that we fall almost into a malaise, a spiritual deadness, requiring a sudden jolt of violence to wake us up.",2013
6,"The Purge definitely has an interesting, and a very relevant to our times, premise. I would even go so far as to say that this film could have been among the best horror films ever made, that is if it were executed with more believability/creativity. The suspension of disbelief here is just too weak for the film to be anything more than a fairly mediocre horror film, and that's definitely disappointing given the interesting and somewhat unique premise. In my view the first 30 or so minutes of the film are quite good. The suspense builds up decently, the characters seem somewhat interesting, the premise has unique possibilities, but then we just end up getting overwhelmed with too many familiar/lazy plot devices to remain held in the grips of the film. The young son in the film becomes basically the goat of stupidity behind practically all of the problems that the main characters have to deal with, and it ends up feeling like a cheap way out. It ends up mostly being a very standard and overdone Hollywood film, because it lacks enough intelligence to deliver truly engaging turning points and an overall solid story. The film had promise, but definitely lacks the creativity to make it a standout.",2013
3,"Once a year laws do not exist. Once a year you can do anything you want for twelve hours and not get in trouble. This is called The Purge and it is designed to let humans let out their frustration on the world. This apparently keeps society healthy, the economy up, and crime down. I'm here to tell you that The Purge is a waste of time. A Waste of money and should not be viewed by anyone with half a mind. ",2013

They value money and accessibility over making something that is risky and potentially historic.

1,"So, from where shall I begin? When I saw, for the first time, the trailer, I had big expectations from this movie. The idea seemed to be original, the trailer looked good, 2 great actors were in there. what more could you ask for? But, apparently, even after I saw its rating on IMDb and most of the critics categorized this movie as one of the worst ones in this year, I still had a little hope that they might be wrong and I'll enjoy this flick Nope, that wasn't true at all. After first 30 minutes, with a slow pacing acting and flawed situations,with unbelievable plot holes, I just gave up. I was convinced that this movie is one of the biggest failures of this year, standing next to After Earth. The acting, which is one of the main things in a movie, was so unconvincing and stupid, with pretty much lame dialogs.. oh god, I can't even talk about it. Plus, the situations the characters were involved into, were so illogically dumb and mediocre, which would make you feel like throwing up. And, of course, the ""purgers"". HAHA. nothing scary, nothing creepy, just some bunch of kids wearing masks, acting like they just got out of circus and making all those goofy jumps. C'mon, let's be serious. Even a 5 y/o kid wouldn't consider this movie, in any way, creepy, whether, scary. To conclude this, The Purge sucks BIG A**",2013

The motivations for the characters were unbelievably confusing and irrational. Basically all of society has turned into psychopaths with the exception of a few poor people and kids. I wish I could say that it was remotely entertaining because I really wanted it to be. The funny thing is it wouldn't have made a difference who was in this movie, the entire film needed a makeover.

You care about what happens to the main characters and want to root for them. One reviewer mentioned that people don't really speak like they do in this show. Who cares! The witty dialog adds levity during some dark moments in the show and adds to the storyline and the dynamics between the characters. So few Networks create material for their Horror SciFi fans. If they do, the show usually lasts only 1 season. Bravo to Netflix for taking a chance on this show and posting the entire first season rather than making us wait each week for the next episode.",2013

I watched all 13 episodes, for some reason I can't explain. I think I kept watching because I thought there would be some explanation for the actions of each character or an explanation of why they were the way they were. Don't expect any clarity, just expect more nonsense and useless subplots. I kept expecting a unicorn to run across the screen without explanation or that someone would end up being a Minotaur or some crap. This was the worst show I've ever sat though and it had absolutely no point.",2013

6,"The graphics are epic and the characters are perfect, but the story line doesn't fit together very well. When I watched it I felt like they were trying too hard to make it look good and be plausible which is great but, the plot slipped through the cracks. It's a nice try but it could have been better. Also they had to many mysteries going on at the same time. It was hard to remember who knew what and how it all came together. They rushed things that needed time and dragged things out that needed rushed. It's a perplexing show and I don't regret watching it, I just wish things had turned out differently. It's a bit gory but interesting too, if you put up with it long enough to find out.",2013

I have to say, that I did not make any connections until the 13th episode. Each episode allowed you to either fall in love, pity or despise certain characters. It even allowed you to question a few characters without understanding why you were questioning them. It was a cliff hanger for sure and totally suspenseful. The casting done by Denise Chamian was incredible as well as the directorial work of Deran Sarafian. Truly impressed and can't wait for more seasons.

1,"I don't know where to begin. This is most certainly one of if not the most haphazard, disarticulated TV production I have ever endured. Did Roth even know he was producing this drivel? The plot plods along at an excruciating, molasses pace. I honestly believe the dialogue was written on a fridge with magnets. There is not one believable, well developed character to be found. The hodgepodge of horror idioms the producers threw against the wall definitely did not stick. The series has no idea what it wants to be. Is it campy? Is it skewed perspective? Is it horror porn? Who knows? The 17 year old teens' conversations produce about one sentence in 100 that one could believe was spoken by a high school student. One of them drinks and smokes like Hemingway. Half the time he dresses like him as well. I made it through most of season one in the hopes that it wily be salvaged by some miraculous intervention. Doesn't happen. I ran out of comedic material to keep myself interested around S:1 E:8. Hemlock is pure garbage.",2014
10,"This is much better than Vampire Diaries. Where all horror beasts live in the same town. I love the empiricism, the wit, the sarcasm, the irony, and the fact that the ""upir"" doesn't even know he is one. The incredible art of watching the ""turn"" was spot on to our imaginations. The crew was cast fantastically. The mother couldn't be more ferocious and envious. It's like a novel written by Poe in the 20th century. Eli Roth, you bear the torch, and I bow to your vision. It keeps me entertained and barely on my seat! I can only hope they continue to create more episodes. What has to be done to continue this series or at least the books should carry the series! Well Done!",2013
5,"I'm almost done watching the whole series, and I have mixed feelings about it. I wanted to like it, but am finding the ""suspenseful"" atmosphere they're trying to convey shows up as contrived. There are some hints of good acting and character interaction. The atmosphere starts off nice, but stays very slow to the point of being boring. Eli Roth seems best at gory horror movies like Cabin Fever and Hostel...with a 13 hour series, I'm finding this very slow and hard to find any character engaging. I see that he executive produced though, and most the writing was done by a newcomer Brian McGreevy. Did I mention the plot is too slow yet? Most times, you figure out what's going to happen...and then it finally does by the next episode. And many scenes that are supposed to be adding suspense, I find just a bit too forced and long. Some of the acting is well done...but it gets lost on weak plot and inconsistent dialog. I don't know who I'm supposed to identify with; as some characters they show back stories of wind up having the weakest motivations. Such is the case of Kandyse McClure's character (Dr. Clementine Chasseur). Her character is an example of the contrived nature of the series. They spend a lot of time with flashbacks that don't add a whole lot to the plot, and she winds up having random lesbian sex. For this whole horror/romance genre, I think True Blood is the best. It's got a mix of horror, mystery, sex, and most importantly: doesn't try to take itself seriously. Maybe that's the main fault I find with this series: that it's trying to take itself too seriously. If this were a truly frightening and/or suspenseful series, then it would have reason to be. This series is trying to have suspense like American Horror Story, but fails to have engaging development.",2013

I thought it was tired 20 yrs ago have 20/30 somethings portraying teenagers ( badly) but they have taken that to a new low. The only one great moment of the show (and there was only one) was a spoiler, so I cant tell you about it.

7,"Sleek and surreal, this new installment from Netflix (produced and directed by fright-man Eli Roth) breathes of noir-style films of yesteryear - if only it were in black and white. About halfway through the first episode I admit I was drifting, having serious doubts of the substantial play of the series. A fan of Netflix's hit 'House of Cards' I was eager to see what was up their sleeves and didn't want to give up too early. The show will pique your interest. It will dabble in sex and bloody-good fun. But this feels like an HBO version of Nickelodeon's Degrassi, with two parts Twilight and a dash of True Blood. Pretty people in over-saturated roles being seen through an over-exposed lens (it's kind of like watching it through a foggy beer glass). But hey, if you can't find a character in this show you wouldn't want to have sex with, then you don't have a pulse. In all seriousness, it will be interesting to see if the characters develop past their inherent sex appeal and find traction in a show that has a lot of potential. It's like riding in the slow lane on a Sunday afternoon in your daddy's Ferrari - when all in takes is an exit and an open road to come alive. Give it the gas and quit toying with us Netflix! A large part of why 'House of Cards' was so great is it hit the ground running and within 10-minutes of the pilot - I'm three episodes in and still waiting for it to make the turn.

1,"There is nothing in Hemlock Grove that hasn't been done to death. Thus it is that this Netflicks produced series relies on all manner of predictable clichés, tedious dialogue and an uninteresting narrative. What's worse is that your average horror aficionado is so familiar with the tropes, which build so painfully slowly, and the ""reveals"" which are hardly surprising, that it verges on insufferable. There are some moments of interesting special effects that indulge in the goo and gore, and its nice not to be saddled with CGI laden special effects (too bad for those Gen Y viewers who confuse CGI for reality and think that everything not digitised looks fake) I suppose for fans of Twilight this sort of horror - cushioned as it between huge mundane moments of poorly written melodramatic dialogue - is just the ticket.

When crimes are occurring on both sides of the channel tunnel, and one right in the middle, these two and their teams must collaborate to save lives.

It is true the first series has dangerous similarities to The Bridge, in my case, the American version was the one I had seen, though I did try to watch the other.

5,"I really loved the original series Bron|Broen and I was curious to see what an intelligent transplantation might look like, particularly with regard to the history of French-English relations. This remake was disappointing. Heavy handed direction, a leaden plot, and wooden performances meant when the finale rolled around I just didn't care. There's a subtlety and a light touch to the original in setting up the backstory that is replaced in this one by hackneyed police procedural clichés. The two leads give performances that are okay for a procedural but don't come anywhere near close to matching the expressiveness and commitment of the leads in the original. I would recommend giving this a miss and watching Bron|Broen instead.",2014
2,"We all recognized ""The Bridge"" well then, we can have a little fun comparing. I bailed on ""The Bridge"" after maybe 3 or 4 episodes. Let's try THE TUNNEL - My main observation - I think the writers failed to understand the viewer cared about any of these characters. Yes that's why we binge watch or go back week after week. We like her quirkiness, we want to see how the old boy does with his family. I could tell things were getting shaky about half way through...OK, so we're dealing with a crazy guy so there might be a few unnecessary and abrupt turns in the road - I'll bite. Tension, that's OK. Continued empathy for characters and their families... Finale time! I had no idea what became of Adam until I googled it. I wasn't alone in this. After watching this for SO LONG I thought the ending was pure crap.",2016
8,"Whether you've seen the original Danish/US versions or not this is worth seeing.

5,"sega the female detective in the original version has now been copied twice, this one and the American version of the bridge,and both actresses have come up short, the scriptwriters have attempted to alter the story lines to suit their own needs, and maybe in some ways to distinguish between the differing series, but here it falls flat on its face, i don't think the original female character can ever be replicated because the uniqueness of her acting, she has a way of doing things that are unique to her both as a character and an actor. the way this one differed from the storyline in the original is just way too off, it became disjointed not at all smooth like the original, the acting and the characters here are non compelling and hard to become involved with.this is the main reason for its failure, even as a stand alone series, it doesn't grip you as the original did, to be honest if id been producing this I've have gone and signed up the original actress and hoped her English was up to scratch, so whether you've seen the original or not, this is not good.",2014

The idea of having a joint operation between the French and British police forces to solve a double murder with the corpses left in the Eurotunnel, just as the Danish and Swedish ones for the bridge, was an interesting idea. But for those like me, who had already seen ""The Bridge"", there was no suspense because you knew ahead of time who was going to die and why. However ""The Bridge"" has a better setting, I would say creepier, suitable for a chase to a serial killer. Plus, the actors deliver a better performance especially for their ironic interpretation.",2014
1,"Once you have watched the original Broen / Bron (Swedish / Danish) version, The Tunnel is a complete waste of time. Its like 'Groundhog Day', knowing exactly whats coming next. I hope they don't make a complete hash by copying the 2nd series of Broen / Bron. The British DCI Karl Roebuck played by Stephen Dillane is the only redeeming feature of this programme. Clémence Poésy who plays the French detective Elise Wassermann is no where near as good as Sofia Helin playing Saga Norén in the original series. It would be good if a completely new story was devised that played on language and cultural differences between France and England leading to various problems exacerbated by the Elise Wassermann character's Asperger syndrome.",2014

They just cant allow their cops to be just cops.They have to attend Oxford or Cambridge or ETon. This is supposed to add interest to the character but it looks false to someone from the USA that they just cant doff their class bias. Even your police have to be of the better sort to be appropriate or interesting or competent. Inspector Lewis and Gently being the exceptions .Female Tunnel lead is kind of shallow. I have discovered that British TV is mining the Scandinavian mother lode",2016
1,OMG what on Earth were they thinking about with this turkey?,2014
5,"Having not seen any of the previous incarnations of this story, I enjoyed it. The character of Elise unfolds nicely, where I started by thinking she was just plain rude (which was possibly the intent of the writers), then when you get to know her better start to really like her. The plot and the relationships between the two main characters developed well until they became good friends and thankfully didn't end up in bed together!! However, the excessive use of strong language and sex was entirely unnecessary. It adds no sense of realism (contrary to what some may think), and would not detract from the plot if omitted. The low score is for the excessive use as stated above.",2016
8,"There seems more to this, than previous three reviewers have simplistically agreed. They copy EACH OTHER, denigrating plot/character 'copy' of BRON and THE BRIDGE(US), as reason NOT to watch this series. ",2013
1,"The same exact plot, and a character with the same mannerisms (she even changes tops in the police bull room, that's as far as I got before erasing it). For the third time?? There was some justification for a US version, after all, we're subtitle challenged over here, or illiterate, depending on your view of the US TV audience. But anyone using the internet has seen Bron if they wanted to (I did), so I found the US version vaguely insulting to the intelligence, the way the main plot copied Bron right to the final scene on the bridge. But the Brits? I mean, they actually broadcast the original on British TV! Unbelievable, and I don't care how good the production and acting is . . . unwatchable.",2013
7,"Well I have not watched ""The Bridge"" original or US version but started with the Tunnel. I was into this from the first ten minutes of the series and I was locked in like a great novel. The lead roles were well cast and acted and they added the additional tension to the France V's England Police Forces and their methods of investigation. ",2014
8,"Well, if you haven't noticed by now in this French/UK connection there seems to be an eerie, other worldly (both fig & lit) resemblance to ""The Bridge"" with it's Swedish/Danish connection. The connection extends further in that both series have a pair of detectives one of which is female (Elise/Saga). Furthering this resemblance pairing both have some Aspergers type behaviors. Both are accompanied by a slightly polar opposite male detective. Both series take advantage of recent events in solving the current vogue of criminal activities as well as old standards. As an aside I think Saga, ""The Bridge"" seems to more authentically maintain her Aspergers behaviors through out a series, but just a picky point. ",2017

6,"Have just watched the finale as they say it will not return. Have enjoyed the ride for the most part, the interaction with the two investigators and their colleagues either side of the Channel has been intriguing at times.
However, I felt that the plot in series 3 was not up to the standard set before. In fact it was unbelievable at times and as the credits rolled that last time I was heard to exclaim ""so that's it?!"" Not going to say why because it gives too much away suffice to say the actions of the villains were IMHO too complicated for them to carry off while all the cops were on to them. It felt like Dr Who's scriptwriters had sneaked in at times...",2018
6,"1st season is a reboot of the famous Bron series. And of course it can't be better. But it is OK. Since it is European show, it is not total crap like most american shows. The British detective's character is great, French detective is a little weak, but since they copied Bron, I understand why they had to do it, it is not easy to play a character that has already been played so good.",2018

For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will Poulter very well. ",2013

It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will Poulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie.",2013
9,"Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny ""real"" movie. Starts and ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do it!",2013
10,"Its supposed to be a funny summer movie and it is. It delivers laugh out loud jokes with lots of sexual undertones and overtones. The story- line is set up for an off beat road movie; pick up a smidge of Mary Jane South of the border, down Mexico way and return it to Denver to pay off a debt to the drug dealer. Jason Sedakis is the drug dealer. He assembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off they go to Mexico. Jennifer Anniston plays a stripper, recruited to be the mom, and of course, she ends up in various situations wearing skimpy costumes and making penis jokes. What more could you possibly want?The other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl. Both of them are hilarious for different reasons, the nebbish kid is sincere, honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug dealers schemes. Tension is added to the film by the appearance of a drug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold to the wrong dealer and a DEA Agent and family that the Millers happen to befriend.",2013
9,"We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some of those ""stupid"", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are just the perfect ""family"". They picked just the right people for this comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see it so you can have a good summer laugh!",2013

They fly to Arizona and rent an RV. Hilarious complications ensue.

10,"This movie had a lot of very great actors and actresses who is so funny I almost laughed my a*s off #SPOILERALERT I personally think the funniest moment was in the wan when they listened to ""waterfalls"" and Kenny (""Will Poutler"") rap along with the music #SPOILEROVER. This movie is defiantly one I can watch again and again. Take my advice and watch it if you haven't already watched it. ""Jennifer Aniston"" showed some really great and funny acting with the whole (maybe #SPOILERALERT) striper thing (#SPOILEROVER) and the whole concept of the movie is just plane genius the way it takes all these different kind off problems and just stack them on top of each other is awesome. This movie is kind of in that category that can't be said or written with words you know (hopefully).

Since then, he hasn't done much worth writing home about until now with the hilarious comedy We're the Millers.",2013
8,"For all Jennifer Aniston fans out there, here is an amazing comedy drama movie with a great storyline. The direction is amazing as it character development is at a proper pace. A drug dealer makes a fake family to transfer drugs from Mexico all the way to his hometown. It is one of those movies which make you feel delighted. For people who loved FRIENDS, there is a surprise at the end of movie. But do watch the whole movie before jumping to the end. It is amazing to see that Jennifer Aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous. It is one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she plays a leading role unlike Horrible Bosses.",2014
7,"When the trailers for WE'RE THE MILLERS started making rounds, I had no intention of watching it. It just looked dumb. Another low-brow comedy catering to the lowest common denominator. Then the reviews starting creeping out and the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't all that bad. It wasn't going to win any awards and it's doubtful to be on anyone's top ten list for 2013, but it was fun. So with that little bit of encouragement (and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) I finally relented and, you know, I don't regret it. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely got some laughs thanks to a pretty nice bit of casting. It's a road trip movie with familial themes but it never slaps you upside the head with them. The movie is about small-time drug dealer David Clark (Sudeikis). He's robbed one night by a gang of thugs who make off with all of his drugs and cash, leaving him on boss man Brad Gurdlinger's (Ed Helms) bad side. But he's willing to forgive David and even give him a nice little payday if he'll run down to Mexico, grab a ""smidge"" of marijuana, and bring it back across the border for him. David reluctantly agrees and formulates a plan of bringing the drugs across the border while attracting minimal attention: pose as a family on vacation and cross the border in an RV. But he's going to need a family. He recruits his stripper neighbor Rose (Aniston), a homeless punk (Emma Roberts), and a sheltered neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and soon the ""Millers"" are on their way to Mexico.",2014

You've got the drug dealer, the geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a rebel than anything else).",2013
8,"Normally I stay away from drug related films, as I don't understand it all too much. But seeing as the film had Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston in, I thought I'd give it ago. I was surprised to say the least, and impressed because it wasn't what I thought. Will Poulter created a perfect socially awkward Kenny Miller and Jason Sudeikis really kicked it up a gear. I found it hilarious from start to finish, as the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer. It was honestly a great movie, and I found myself laughing 85% of the time, with a great cast but simple enough storyline, the film delivered on many levels. Must see movie, even if you just watch Jennifer Aniston.",2014

8,"We're the Millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie. Small time pot dealer played by Jason Sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to his supplier, so to pay off the debt, the goofy and eccentric supplier sends him on a big time smuggling deal into Mexico. As cover, Sudeikis convinces stripper/neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife, runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) as their daughter, and young neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) as their son-- and together they become the uber-American family, the Millers. Naturally, the situations and people they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according to plan. There were lots of chuckle-out-loud moments (not so many full blown belly laughs), and it moved along at a pretty fast clip. The performances were all outstanding, especially Sudeikis. Loved watching him! Parents: some sexually suggestive scenes won't be appropriate for kids, or you'll have some 'splainin to do. All in all, a real fun film.",2013

It has just become one of my favourite films of all time. Perfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature in this film. anything with Jennifer Aniston is worth a watch in my eyes even if it was rubbish which it wasn't. 10 out of 10 from me. as previously described 'so dumb yet so funny' i agree completely. you will be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film. its a bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier.",2014

1,"In the movie ""The Millers"", Disney and Jennifer Anniston sink to a new low. For Disney to put their name on this movie is sad. The ""F"" word repeated over and over again is not comedy. The ""daughter"" told the flight attendant on the airplane trip to Mexico that she has missed her last few periods, and she doesn't know how that could be, since all she has done lately is anal sex. And the ""father"" trying to get his ""wife"" to give a corrupt Mexican policeman oral sex is also not comedy. Then when that fails, Disney thinks that the adult ""father"" trying to get his ""son"" to give a blow job to the Mexican policeman is the height of comedy. Jennifer Anniston ""acting in"" and lending her name to this film shows her little regard she has for herself now. And going around the country touting this movie and her stripping moves, without telling what the movie is really like, is false advertising. Parents who brought their children to see a Disney comedy got a terrible surprise. Needless to say, we walked out and got our money back, and I recommend that anyone else not even go in. Unless that is your idea of comedy.",2013

1,"How can I fully express my total disappointment in this film? It may not be possible. I am one of those who actually liked the first Grown Ups. It had a plot, good characters and lots of fun. The sequel, on the other hand, is pointless, stupid, juvenile, and insulting. Not one redeeming quality in the entire movie. I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes! I forced myself to stay just to see if this mess would get any better. It didn't. The jokes concern nude men, homosexual men, brainless women, sex, bodily functions (over and over again!), and more of the same, repeatedly. No story, no acting, no thought, no point. I was the first one out of the theater and never looked back.",2013

It's worse than Grown Ups, for heaven's sake! There's no plot, none, zip, nada. Characters and gags are set up without payoff much like in Jack and Jill. Almost every attempt at a joke falls flat. Anyone who wants to make a comedy should watch Grown Ups 2 as an example of one that does almost everything wrong and what to and what not to do when directing and making a mainstream comedy.",2013
1,"This movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. There is no story line, and every single one of the ""grown up men"" in excessively creepy.

It was really hard to find anyone likable in this movie. All the characters were stiff and uninteresting. ",2013

Do not watch this waste of time. I remember watching Kevin James on the king of queens and that is a really funny show, I really don't know why he is also constantly in movies that aren't funny. I guess its a way to make a quick buck in the industry, stick to real comedies, like This Is The End.

I would consider it a mediocre movie if it had of been released in the 90's, but Sandler's movies are becoming extremely repetitive, and I think people are beginning to get fed up with Adam Sandler if they weren't already, I think it is time he gives it a rest. Grown-Ups 2 has some jokes that made me crack a smile, or chuckle, but has absolutely no plot, it's like watching a mash-up of jokes play out in front of you, rather then watching a movie thats funny. Not worth watching in theatres, rent or watch it online. Hopefully this will be Sandler's last movie for a while, and this is coming from a person who enjoys some of his movies.",2013

This film had basically no point or plot at all. It was incredibly disappointing. I barely laughed at all. All of the jokes and humor was unbelievably crass and perverted. The movie was just plan dirty. The first one had its moments but this one felt like a big ""one of those moments."" The dialog was disappointingly gross in the end. Giving this a 3 out of 10 still seems a little to high and mighty even for this. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours and don't see this lame excuse for a sequel.",2013

But this-- no plot. Every time they had a faint outline of one they ruined it. The most decent part about it was the jokes, but those got old and annoying. Everything was predictable, cheesy and and totally unrealistic. The scenes where the action that's happening is supposed to make you laugh were all from other comedy movies, just a lame remake of them. Tire rolling down the city. Wow didn't see that coming. The fight party scene. Totally cliché. It was all very fake. How could one take a decent movie and butcher the sequel so bad? I don't know why this has so many stars. All around a waste of my time and money! If you are going to make a movie with continuous bad humor, at least make it funny for some immature kids or tweens.

This movie is set a few years after the first and all the characters have excuse the pun 'Grown Up'. Some great additions to this cast were Steve Austin and Shaq O' Neill.

1,"The big ""spoiler"" is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is ""revived"" and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please. Will someone make a movie with a clever plot that keeps you guessing to the end and with interesting and passably believable characters.",2013

7,"In segments, Gravity has marvelous special effects--truly a remarkable achievement. The weak parts of the movie are the contrivances that link these segments together, along with unbelievably bad dialog.

1,"Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don't want to rag on it, but if you're going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard's Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a ""space movie"". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clichés, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering ""eeny meeny miney mo"" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle's communication equipment fails to pick up ""Houston Control"", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock's character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clichéd hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clichéd announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he's drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick's Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, ""Gravity"" lacked gravitas.",2013

5,"The critics who drool over GRAVITY must be as oxygen-starved as Sandra Bullock's character. Visually arresting, yes. But GRAVITY is a triumph of style over substance, and fantasy over plausibility. (Many spoilers ahead.) Leave aside for the moment the utter implausibility of the chain reaction of satellite disasters. (Satellites orbit at different altitudes. That's space 101.) In my former life as a journalist, I wrote a long article on space junk. A collision with one piece of flotsam would have plausibly sufficed. A fusillade of space junk is overkill. And Ed Harris's alert about the first mishap was a clumsy telegraph of the crisis to come. Would that the director had invested one-tenth the attention he gave the pictures into the plot. Also ignore Bullock's out-of-control Chinese capsule surviving re-entry into Earth's atmosphere ... or landing within a dog-paddle to shore on a planet that's 70% covered by water. Oh, and space capsules are DESIGNED for water landings, which means they DON'T flood when the door opens. Forget all that. Instead, focus on character, which is what movies are all about -- or should be. The actors can't be faulted for the sins of the writers: Clooney is written as a one-dimensional, wise-cracking Danny Ocean. Bullock sounds like her character from SPEED, not a brilliant Harvard Ph.D. In one of the hoariest moments of the film, Bullock actually PAUSES in her tortoise-like race to safety to listen to Clooney's pep talk (can't we drive a stake through that cliché?), then gets a second wind -- while breathing Co2 -- and sprints the final yards to safety (another cliché). Upon reaching the Russian capsule, she wastes time stripping and napping -- for the sake of the director's silly rebirth metaphor -- while Clooney waits to be rescued. Again, the actors are doing the best they can with the material they have. But the only Oscars this film deserves are for the visuals. Certainly not for acting, writing, or music. (Composers: The single, sustained note that slowly builds to a thunderous crescendo is a cliché. Oh, and you just telegraphed the outcome.) Which brings us to dialogue. To quote one screenwriter, ""Why does every director assume he can write?"" Anyone who's been in a life-or-death moment knows that people just don't engage in serial wise-cracking or kill time with long anecdotes. The sheer silliness of some of the lines undermined the spectacle of the images. As for Bullock's monologues (e.g., the baby broadcast, the ode to Clooney) -- well, the writers wrote themselves into a corner there. As a writer, I appreciate the challenge of putting words into her mouth when she has no one to listen. What came out rang false.... Want a good film about a disaster in space? Watch APOLLO 13. Enjoy -- or try to -- GRAVITY for the 3D spectacle it is. But don't let it go to your head.",2013

If you set aside the horrible acting and the obviously written-in-a-day plot, all you have left is a steaming heap of special effects and sound editing that is designed to rope in young or stupid movie viewers, these days they are synonymous. This is essentially Sanctum(2011) cloned, set in space, with worse acting, and less intelligence. This movie had it's accurate moments, a rarity among cinema, but the creators also dropped the ball hard on many of the physics in the movie.

What made Apollo 13 so good was the realism, attention to detail, and focus on problem solving. Gravity has none of these. Instead we get an idiotic, annoying mission commander who acts like a mentally deficient drunk, and a ditzy engineer who is so incompetent at being an astronaut that you have to wonder how she got past the qualifying exam.",2013

Apart from utter trivial and bad dialogue, with no depth or feeling, we do not care one iota for them. the bullock character is so bad and useless and mostly out of control, yet we have to swallow that she makes it. the death of clooney is utterly pointless, there was no reason for him to die. the science, well the science does not exist in this movie, things happen that just would not. the debris that hits them would be falling as it rotates round the earth so would not be in the same orbit second time around, they very conveniently have the Chinese station doing that but not the other floating objects. What keeps really annoying me is that critics here that write for the so called intelligent papers and media, go in and see a film like this and leave their brains at the door, i know assume that in fact they do not possess and intellect whatsoever. they write like 14 year old fan boys, if any unknown director or someone they considered a hack had made this they would have laughed at it, but because it was cuaron they lapped it up.",2013
1,"Hollywood could have probably made 100 decent movies from the money they wasted on this garbage. The film should have been called drudgery not gravity. A 3D extravaganza that delights you with flying pencils, fire in zero G and Bullocks arce but is devoid of any sensible story and utterly empty of any acting from the two leads. We start on a NASA mission to repair the Hubble and are introduced to the most unprofessional team of astronauts NASA has assembled since Armaggedon. Bullock, a medical doctor ???? with 6 months training, is repairing a complex piece of equipment in the void of space while the mission commander Clooney does loop the loop around the shuttle and another of the crew does some kind of space dance. Ignoring the glaring plot chasm in that why would NASA use an untried doctor of medicine to repair space telescopes we have two astronauts playing like school kids in the scariest environment known to Mankind. At the very least they should have been keeping an eye on the rookie. Then the Russians blow up space to save money on decommisioning a satellite and the story hits rock bottom as a very unprofessional NASA start a general panic and the crew get killed. Bullock is drifting in a ridiculous way screaming her butt off as Clooney jets in like someone off Star Wars to save the day.",2013
8,"Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.",2013

2,Waste of time. ,2013
1,"There is no other way to describe this show than awful and I am sorry to say that Stephen King should have retired long ago. His stories are so formulaic that they harbor on torture for a mature reader. This show takes a bad story and actually manages to make it worse by realizing the characters in a audio/visual presentation. Sometimes, even a bad story can make for a good show or movie but in this case we hit a double whammy. This show has arguable the worst script writing I have seen since Awe Bol movies. The is followed by an turd of an acting job by pretty much everyone in the show. Perhaps they were so discouraged by the premise and script that they couldn't put any heart into it or perhaps they are so lousy that they make the script seem worse. Who knows except those on the set. Lastly, music and sound effects are also generic and uninspiring. I wont knock down a TV show for music and sound but I figured I should point it out. Last lets talk about the story... wow what a money grabbing turd of a story about a mysterious dome. I think that the entire story was written during a couple of bathroom breaks following a generic bullet point list of how to write a story for dummies. Pointless mysteries and riddles followed by unintelligible characters who would never survive in any sort of society or world. Frankly, I think the show needs to be canceled and if they want a big viewership turnout they should announce that they will be killing every single character in the season finale. I guarantee you that the entire viewership will be cheering as the show characters get erased and everyone will party when the credits roll for the last time. Horrible show.",2014

The show suddenly acquired the feel of a cheap teenage Disney production, with its aims at younger, much less demanding and much more brain-dead audience. The 'shifting allegiances' tool of the plot is so cliché, it's sickening. 'Lost' had it in abundance, and in retrospect it too feels disgusting; however, when new and fresh, it was watchable.",2014

1,"I forced myself to watch all 13 episodes of season 1. The only people worth any praise for this garbage are the FX guys. The characters are wooden and poorly acted, mainly because the script sounds like it was written for pre-school children. The characters are so stupid and unintelligent in their actions and dialogue; I kept waiting for an explanation for this stupidity to come from the psychological interplay with the dome! This series was obviously written and produced for a particular audience; unintelligent, knuckle dragging, bible belt dwellers somewhere in the southern states of the USA. Why some television executives in Great Britain thought this was suitable for us Brits is beyond my rationale. Whoever it was, he should be sacked. If you want to waste 520 hours, like I did, then watch it, but remember to remove all sharp objects from your kitchen draw lest you harm yourself through the overwhelming feeling of utter exasperation.",2014

The acting is forced and trivial and I am now in the process of deleting it from my hard drive and memory. This could have been something great, but, of course, it just turned into garbage. Typical TV for today. I really don't know how I can get ten lines of review to meet the IMDb requirements for this show since I have stated pretty much everything in the first paragraph. The show was interesting to start with, even with the bad acting and lack of scientific continuity. It has taken so many twists and turns that the viewer has no idea if something is going to pop up to complete the idea or just left hanging without any concept of completion.

Big Jim sneaking in vast quantities of propane for the manufacture of illicit drugs was laughable. To have an elected official manage to hide that much illegal traffic passing through a, supposedly, quiet little town without raising suspicion of the populace is indicative of the contempt of the author for the average citizen of America. To top off the idiocy in the storyline, the semi-insane son of Big Jim, not only kidnaps and imprisons his ""girlfriend"" for her own good, but the girl is let go by Big Jim with a promise not to tell anyone. Insane as that may seem to be, the very same son is suddenly made a deputy sheriff and given a gun! The tale goes, inexorably, downhill from there until the final, supposedly suspenseful, installment last night. Plan on finding something else to do next Summer in the time slot when this inanity returns. ",2013
5,"As with every other Stephen King adapted miniseries this one started well, faded in the second round, and became formulaic by episode three. The characters are all two dimensional and been done too many times before. The dialog is trite and banal ""it pays to be team player in this town"" says the former high school quarterback. There is little suspense, little action, little romance and it's hard to get involved when there's 3 minute of commercials every 6 minutes. And yet the rating is hovering around 8 because of people voting after the first episode - If this was an ocean cruise I bet they'd have written on the voyage comment cards after the first night ""Best time ever! I love the Titanic!""",2013

But 13 episodes was twice too long, and the idea of 5 series of 13 simply too awful to contemplate. The characters are all cardboard cut-outs....""one dimensional"" is the most charitable term. I didn't bother with episodes 5 to 12, since each week it was all the same story, with just a small teaser each time to egg the plot along a little at a snail's pace. I watched week 13, hoping for it to be all over, and for it to be given a decent burial. No such luck. They should have had the heroine jump into the lake, dying a martyr's death, and have Junior pulled the handle on the scaffold so that Barbie was gone too, in heroic sacrifice.

Did the Trailer Park Boys write it? (actually it would be better if they had). Almost all characters suck except for Big Jim. The acting is extremely amateurish. They need to immediately throw that annoying little redheaded freak, Big Jim's son (man he sucks so bad it hurts), and that scientist thing straight into a wood chipper!!

The facts are completely turned around, all the characters are young and beautiful and boring, and have no resemblance to those made so alive and real by Mr Kings writing. And the dialog is so completely under the mark. I know it's impossible to cram all the details of a book into a film version. But this is a series, so there is some time to work with, and one would think that in order to relay as much as possible from the real deal, one would take advantage of a little halfway intelligent dialog.

8,"As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these ""coffins on wheels"", every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.",2014

10,"DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970′s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.",2013

Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places.

A lot of reviewers said this was a microcosm of society and the struggle of the rebels showed the climbing through the classes of to the ultimate end which is demise. These people also weren't concerned with the functionality of this microcosm and some even said it would have ruined the film if it was explained. ,2014
1,"Please understand I write this review with no personal biased whatsoever. I like sci-fi movies just as much as all other movies. This movie was unbelievably bad. The acting was awful, the script one of the worst I've ever heard and so unoriginal I predicted every single scene. They try to rip off the matrix and make 0 political points at all. It's supposed to be about the classes but they give no story of the classes. No one on the train at all works, some people only drink and party, some only get their hair done and no one sleeps. One girl randomly has visions and that is never explained again. It is like the actors and directors ate a bunch of acid and just turned a camera on. It makes NO SENSE it is the worst movie I've seen in my life. People who rate this high are obviously fans of some comic it is based on and probably paid promoters. I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be released even on DVD/demand. With a 40 million dollar budget they couldn't even get in the theatres. Please do not watch this.",2014

The picture was well made in technical terms, the effects were great and Ed Harris stole the show at the end. The only other character that held my interest was Tilda Swinton who was terrific but underused. The movie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. The action was so unbelievable, at times it tried to be realistic and then tried to be a comic book. Plots holes are so numerous all the way through. The train itself became a parody and was so predictable as was the ending. Do not be fooled by the high rankings, this film was just a mess.",2014
1,"After years this is movie which make me open account here at IMDb. Why? Well i couldn't believe such high ratings for this movie. Terrible screenplay, terrible story, completely without logic and common sense, so full of contradictions. Favorite character: unkillable bad guy, no meter you stab him, choke him, bleed him. He is, like one reviewer here nicely notice,Terminator. There is no info why the Korean girl is so terrified of him or why he is so obsessed to kill her but not rebellion leader(Chris Evans). And end of movie when they just blow the doors causing train destruction.There is so many logic flows in this movie. Whats the point of all of this. Just pass this, there is much more better time wasters than this one terrible movie.",2014

For those of you uninterested in topics like '1984' and 'Animal Farm', watch this film for a hazard course in understanding the human condition. From start to end you see a small-scale depiction of society from it's most basic 'proletariat' level, right up to the elite, in perfect order. And we see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science, education, quality, luxury, then hedonism, wastefulness and eventual demise, in exactly that order.",2013

The Room is considered the worst movie ever made and has spawned a cult following and interactive screenings that involve screaming at the camera man to focus, and throwing spoons. I didn't get to enjoy that because I cleverly thought, ""why go see a bad movie for $9 when I can see a great movie for $9?"" Boy was I wrong!",2014

Only thing that dragged me to the theater was the director's name (also the great cast), and i am happy to say that i'm pleasantly blown away by director Bong once again. The movie looked great, the first half was beyond thrilling, the acting for the latter half was just, top notch, the action was bloody and fantastic, and most of all, the ideology behind the story was interesting to say at least.

Not one single coherent idea in the entire movie. Just an attempted affirmation of communism. The producers of this movie should have paid the audience to sit through this crapola. Worse than anything Ed Wood could have ever dreamed up. As for the plot, this is it: people ride round and round on a solar powered train while mayhem occurs. That is the whole movie.",2014

10,"I just want to start off by saying this is an amazing film about young love that is actually honest with its audience. There are countless of films about people falling in love, but when you see ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"". You realize just how rare films are that make a sincere attempt to catch what it really is like to fall for someone, without sentimentality, forced cuteness or cheap emotional manipulation. This is the rare love story that has real emotional truth about it. The fact that it is about two women who fall for each other is almost secondary to the way the film catches the universality of what it is like to fall in love and maintain the relationship. ""Blue is the Warmest Colour is a naturalistic and touching film, whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or whatever orientation. This is a film that can give you relationship advice and life guidance no matter what your orientation may be. It isn't an indulgent film bringing only a unique gay relationship to light and nothing more, and it isn't an ode to ""coming out"" and stockpiled clichés of ""being different."" It shows how an interaction with a person can have a truly provocative impact on you as a person.",2013

10,"I saw this film on the last night it was playing at my local theater and I jumped on the opportunity. Once it was over I realized how smart of a decision it was. I read a review of the film that said something along the lines of, ""the trouble with this film being 3 hours is that you want to watch it for several more."" I couldn't agree more with that statement. The story, along with its characters, moves the film along to the point where it didn't feel like 3 hours. ",2013
9,"I waited some days to review this title after seeing this film. This movie triggered me thinking about love and life and I waited to give it my neutral review. I am watching movies since the latest 30 years and I have to say ; This movie is special !! After 30 years of seeing all kind of movies I have narrowed my scope of movies to see. They have to be special, show me something different, give me ideas to think about or to evaluate in my own life. So, movies like World war Z is not directly my style. This movie although is one of the best love stories I have seen. No unnecessary emotional or cuteness parts, each part of the story is real and genius. It is the soft moments of a love story, the hard moments bringing to the screen. The movie is made in away you are in the skin of Adele and Emma ( can't remember the actress names ). They take you with them in their love story, their feelings. That is also the reason that the 3 hours of the movie is not too long at all. I was surprised it took 3 hours when the film ended. The movie handles the passion between them, a passion that many of us forget over the years in a relation. That passion is also expressed in about 3 sex scenes, 3 scenes which are quiet honest and direct. Some people will find these scenes too long ( one of them could take 10 minutes ), but I find it necessary to establish your follow up of the passion they have between each other, so that when things goes worse you also are one with the situation.",2013
10,"I have never seen a film about a face until Blue. Almost every emotion the face can show is expressed by the leading actress: longing, satisfaction, shame, allure, hunger, anger, grief, boredom, suspicion. I was worried after the opening scenes that the film was one of stark realism despite its whimsical title. However, after a short time, it took on its poetical style, and in the street, just before Adele sees Emma, we hear the first sound of music. From then on the film is an exercise in cinematic eloquence. ",2013
9,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a screening last night in Los Angeles. It was amazing, everything about it amazing! Kechiche is something special. He works on something until he gets it right, and the only time he gets it right is when he feels comfortable with what he has shot. At the Q&A afterward with Kechiche, Seydoux and Exarchopoulos, I learned that they shot some of the takes 100 times!",2013
9,"I certainly blinked when I found out this movie was 3 hours long, especially considering that it won the Palm d'Or where many winners have a slow and painful plot. This movie on the other hand does a great job keeping every scene riveting through great dialog and riveting emotions. I would compare many of the scenes in this movie to Tarantino scenes where scenes take on a life of their own. Cleverness and awkwardness were dispersed in a way to make it seem real and ultimately human. I felt wonderfully disappointed when certain scenes ended. The actresses held nothing back in their body language and added much to the moment-to-moment importance of their character development.",2013
10,"Cinematic orgasm. Cinematic. Orgasm. Put the words together and separately, it does not matter actually. I was watching the film with a sense of bitten apricot in my mouth, so from time to time I kept checking if indeed something was dripping from my lips . In any case, you can feel all kinds of dripping in this garden of delight and from many different angles. A deep diving into puberty, into the raw desires of youth, above the thunderous victory of human need. Adele is the personification of youth, just in time when it begins to grown. That exact moment when the juices of love are instantly aggressive and the human body seems like a fruit with the heart as a kernel. When you are in the midst of immortality, gaining the illusion of eternity, just before the fruit is eaten, shortly before the kernel sits at your neck with the bitter taste of rejection, while you greedily swallow life, which seems so inexhaustible. I left my local cinema with the feeling of a hot lump in my throat and stomach. As a teenager in love and disappointed at the same time. And from that moment I keep seeing little hearts and stars everywhere. I keep seeing Adele everywhere.",2013
9,"Though Blue is the Warmest Color, winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, contains graphic depictions of sex, it is not a voyeuristic exercise but a complex, deeply intense film that elevates one young woman's personal struggle into a drama of universal relevance. Adapted by Kechiche and Ghalia Lacroix from the novel by Julie Maroh, Tunisian born French director Abdellatif Kechiche's fifth feature looks with piercing eyes into the coming-of-age years of Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and her relationship with the more mature Emma (Lea Seydoux), a relationship that does not fit anyone's pictures.

10,"i normally tend to stay away from romance movies, but at the same time i cannot resist a good controversy, i looked into some reviews and the people talking about the film said you must seek it out, it must be seen, so i tracked down a cinema that was showing it, watched it and WOW.",2013
9,"This year's Palm d'Or winner is a coming of age story about a teenage girl, Adele (the literal title in French is The Life of Adele), who discovers her homosexuality and begins a relationship with Emma, a college student. For a while, I was thinking this was a good but fairly unremarkable entry into the queer cinema canon, but, over the film's three hours, well, you see why the long running time was necessary. It is just a very detailed picture of a life. It feels more real than most films - it feels like more time has past and that we've just felt Adele's growth. Frankly, I didn't feel the length of it at all - I wanted it to be longer. It really helps that the actresses are so perfect. Adele Exarchopoulos is simply fantastic - this is the performance of the year, really. Her face is so expressive. The film takes place over several years, and you really do see her grow from a child to an adult. Lea Seydoux plays Emma. Her role is less demanding, but she's still great in it. Now, the biggest story of this film has probably been the graphic sex scenes. My opinion on them: I actually do think they're a bit too graphic, gratuitous and almost pornographic. I try to justify them artistically in my mind, and I'm afraid I can't. There's a plot point near the end where you kind of have to know that the girls' sex life was fantastic, but I'm not sure we had to see it in anywhere near as much detail as we did. They're without a doubt awkward to sit through, but they don't ruin the film either.",2013
10,"Blue is the Warmest Colour has become one of the most controversial films of the past year on the basis of its frank depiction of lesbian sexuality alone, but the film is so much more than that. The sex is merely a device used to accelerate the plot and enrich the realism of the film. The film presents a very beautiful and ultimately devastating love story that far transcends the hyped bedroom proclivities of the two main characters.",2014
10,"This is a very tender , passionate tale of young love that I found fascinating . The three hours will simply fly by as you follow the life of Adele who falls in love with an arty student . The lead actress is stunning in both looks and believability , and you are swept along with her on her journey . This is acting on the edge...powerful and dramatic...worthy of many awards . The story rattles along at pace , and hardly has time to fully explore all the issues that are on show . Adeles family and friends for example simply disappear after a while , which was odd , as they were an important part of the anti-lesbian feeling present early on in the film . Nonetheless , its almost impossible to find fault . I didn't shed a tear at any stage (but came close a few times ) . The now infamous sex scenes were in my opinion incredibly moving and central to the plot (however they were rather long...men will be used more to a ""Wham Bam 30 seconds approach "" ! ) You should all go to see this ...male and female alike...though perhaps don't take your Mother !",2013
8,"While watching 'La Vie d'Adèle', I regularly thought about 'Entre les Murs', the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes five years ago. Not only because in both films many scenes take place in classrooms, but also because they both have an ultra-authentic feeling. ",2013

The scenes in the park and the interplay of sentiments and nuances between the two lovers are very emotional and engaging. The difference of characters is very well presented.",2013

1,"To put it in as simple terms as possible, Blue Is The Warmest Colour is a story about Adèle, a high school student who finds herself confused and troubled with her sexual identity. After passing a blue-haired girl on the street who catches her eye and an even more confusing, spontaneous and upsetting encounter with a classmate she finds it all to curious and enticing when a close, male friend takes her to a gay bar, she follows some girls to another bar nearby where she sees the blue- haired girl again. A short conversation sparks a relationship that carries us through the rest of the film.",2014
8,"Of the two competition films I saw in Cannes, this was luckily one of them. If you enjoy foreign cinema at all you will likely find this mesmerizing. I'm a straight male but I couldn't help but feel strongly for the two women during this unconventional love story. ",2013
2,"I highly anticipated this film, mostly because of the glowing reviews by those who evaluate movies for a living. Anyways, the movie itself was a big disappointment. It's marketed as realistic, wrenching love story about two women; I was hopeful that such a movie would be somewhat female centric in it's point of view. I was wrong. This is a movie for men by men. It is replete with beautiful young women who are (surprise surprise) extremely sexual. There are many shots of the main character's backside (in jeans, in pants, in a dress) as she walks away from the camera which feel highly objectifying and gratuitous. The sex scenes (featuring one party masturbation as well as two party lovemaking) are terribly unrealistic and likely represent the director's fantasy of what a woman's sexuality is like.",2013
9,"A truly magnificent and vivid work of art! ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" should be standard repertoire for the aspiring filmmaker and the avid film connoisseur. Tight and close shots give the feeling of being in the moment with the characters and feeling the same emotions that they feel. The acting was superb and extremely well-done, proving evidence that the directing was near flawless. Being one of the rare films where I feel captivated throughout the entirety of the film I will gladly put this one on my 'watch again' list. ",2013
9,This film is truly exceptional. The quality of the acting and the production itself sets 'Blue Is The Warmest Colour' far beyond many other films.,2014
1,"There is a misconception that if a movie has long shots of the wind moving the tree leaves, or if it is slow, the movie is of high quality. I don't agree. A quality movie is one which moves something inside, in your hart. A artistic movie is one that makes me awe the aesthetics, this movie was nether. I feel that the only reason this movie has got so much attention is the cheep use of lesbian porn, and you can find that a lot faster on the web without wasting three hours of your life. Beyond that, I thought the story line was dull, and not true to reality. I am fed up of movies showing relationships built only on sex, and not of friendship and love, this teaches the public the wrong thing. ",2013
10,"At first I was very nervous at the prospect of another Superman movie. Especially considering how horrible ""Superman Returns"" was; however, ""Man of Steel"" was a roller coaster of a ride as we not only witness Kal El's (Clark Kent's) origins, but we are shown Superman the way he is supposed to be.",2014
5,"I remember the day this film came out like it was yesterday. Because it literally was. It only came out three years ago. Me and a buddy skipped school to see this film opening day. We were so excited for this film and we were not even Superman fans. The trailer where Zod's menacing voice over told Kal El to turn himself in or watch earth suffer the consequences was chilling and a stroke of advertising genius. Easily one of the best trailers ever made. Our combined hype for this film was like the hype I had experienced for The Dark Knight Rises. I guess I should have got a clue as the mixed feelings I had for that film were multiplied ten fold in this film. Man of steel is a mess. The pacing is off with the film cutting back and forth too much in time at the beginning leaving adult Clark Kent a half baked husk of a character. Speaking of characters, where is the character development in this film? I had almost zero attachment to any of the characters presented. Which is either a symptom of me not really knowing the characters of the comics as a converting superman fan, or is a result of poor writing. The film did have some interesting ideas when it came to the visual design of the costumes and technology. The Cgi became a mixed bag of untextured and obvious Cgi men punching each other, which certainly disappointed me as I found some of the action scenes to be otherwise terrific. And then the action scenes went on,and on, and then I got quite bored and by the time the best fight started between Zod and Superman, I didn't care anymore because I knew Superman had to win. I mean it would have been cool if I was not so exhausted by the previous thirty minutes of mind numbing and repetitive violence inflicted on extremely fake looking Cgi people. The film felt longer than it was and is, sadly, not re-watchable at all with it's drab, miserable, tone and inconsistent pacing. A very low 5 out of 10 for this bloated bore.",2016

9,"The trailers of this movie were released in a so effective way that you start to fear if the product will fill your expectations. And with the usual critics-know-about-everything-nothing-is-good- to-me reviews the chances of be confused about this are increasing. As high as the expectations were raised after trailers, i have to tell you that you will not disappointed with this movie. Is different in many ways to the usual superhero movies but is a solid product that fits in what you expect from this kind of film. Nice references to previous movies are well executed and new plot additions are well received too. As you can expect from a Zack Snyder movie, there are several scenes that try to resemble graphic novel arts and in my opinion are very well made. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The most of them (unfortunately i can't say all of them) look very realistic according laws of physics, the CGI are so well made that you wish that development for many movies you seen before. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality. ",2013

You can not just take a symbol (for some like me sacred) such as SUPERMAN and make this joke called MAN OF STEEL only for get a lot of money (that is called ""sell your soul"")... The essence of Superman is that he is the symbol of hope, because of that SUPERMAN is not a SUPER-MAN by their supernatural powers, instead he is by their conviction, principles and values​​, the teachings of his father Jhonathan and what learns JOR-EL (not in 5 minutes)...

1,"Live action filmmakers apparently don't know anything about Superman. I should warn you, I think the best Superman adaptation has been in animation, especially the animated series of the 90s with Tim Daly as Superman. Superman is always the boy scout, the Captain America of the DC Universe, honest, noble, brave and true. This is not the case in Man of Steel. The filmmakers were confused by Nolan. Nolan created a realistic and dark, brooding Batman series. Here is the problem. Batman is not realistic. And neither is Superman. You can't make Superman a dark, brooding individual who's confused about who he is.",2013

There were several things I didn't like about the movie: ,2016
2,"After the all-round disappointment of Superman Returns, it was decided that a reboot was the best way to go for the iconic superhero following the success of the Dark Knight trilogy. Director Zack Snyder was brought on board, best known for his adaptions of the comics 300 and Watchmen (the former being overwhelmingly style over substance and the latter surprisingly good if uneven). Added to that the cast featured many excellent actors who could bring weight to their roles. However, for all the films potential it is just as dull and uninteresting as Superman Returns was despite its greatest efforts to avoid any comparison. ",2016
9,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born, and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like 'The Hobbit', I didn't think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun, entertaining movie.",2013

The storyline was bad, the acting was bad, the action scenes were too much. Why would they do this to such a great story. I honestly do not see how anyone could like this movie if they have ever known anything about Superman. The scenes from Krypton were bad, the way they used flashbacks to tell the Smallville story was bad, the whole Zod storyline was poorly written. The battle scenes look like they destroyed Metropolis yet Clark goes to work at the Daily Planet at the end???? This was an overproduced poorly written movie with a storyline that has so much potential. I suggest everyone save their money.",2013
1,That's because it should not have been made.,2013
8,"Jack Snyder's fresh take on Superman/Man of Steel is... fresh indeed. A superhero movie that maxes visual wizardry but beautifully balanced by emotional tones without feeling heavy. Gone is the sleek metal and crystal polish we have known replaced by a techno- organic theme (reminds me of Prometheus) that is both regal and advanced. This is perhaps the only Superman film with the best narrative of the Kryptonian's heritage and history. Good casting and an impressive performance by Russell Crowe. I give it an 8.5/10 (just behind Dark Knight Rises IMHO). The Dad in me deems this movie watchable by kids (more age-appropriate, less violent than Iron Man 3)",2013
9,"I have never been a hardcore superman fan, but I was fortunate enough to see an early showing of Zack Snyder's reboot. And I must say, I am quite impressed. Casual moviegoers and superhero fans will find something to enjoy. Man of Steel has great wreck- everything action that makes full use of 3D effects and simply looks awesome. The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow(e). The character Perry White wasn't used to his full potential, but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman, you might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty up- tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous, making him less charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future. (that makes for an awesome showdown, by the way.) To summarize, I give Man of Steel an 8.6 for it's portrayal of a classic American hero.",2013
1,"I'll confess I didn't weep, I came very close though. I was open minded, waiting, willing, then around a third of the way through I realised that what I was watching was more than just a film, another blockbuster, a popcorn munching way to while away the summer evening, what I was really watching was the moment story died..",2013
1,I wish I could burn this film from my memory for real. I'm seriously not kidding. I really don't know how to describe the dread I felt within the first half hour when I knew this was as bad as others had warned me it would be and even worse than most critics said it would be. It really was beyond cringe worthy and those space ships. Don't even get me started. I expected Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith to come crawling out of one with cigars in their mouth. Something blows up. A bunch of blurry images zoom by and then it starts again. And repeat. And repeat. Rinse and repeat. That's how I feel trying to wash out the bad taste this film left behind. Nolan should stick to directing and not producing. Snyder and David Goyer need to launch themselves into space so this planet never again has to be subjected to anything this illogical and monotonous.,2013
4,"I was really excited to see this movie considering all the creative and successful names that were attached to it. However I came out of it more frustrated than anything else. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't, and here are some reasons why: ",2013
1,If you are a die-hard Superman fan then be ready for a huge disappointment.Not for a moment will you get the overwhelming warmth in your heart when superman saves the day which you got when Christopher Reeve played Superman.This is just another film which lacks totally lacks a solid story and the makers are completely confident that they will fool the audiences again with massive unnecessary special effects(Same goes with Iron Man 3).Lois Lane is apparently more smart than Man of Steel as she somehow manages to be present at all the locations where Man of Steel is about to fall.I came back home and watched the real Superman just to erase this bad portrayal of my favorite superhero.,2013
10,I am a big superman fan and luckily got a chance to see its early screening and believe me it was a brilliant movie. I had very high expectations from the movie and this film has completely exceeded my expectation. The visual effects and action sequences in the movie are actually the best I have ever seen. It easily overcomes The Avengers in every single way and will for sure emerge as a big blockbuster film at the box office. I don't know why the critics are saying that it focused more on the action than on clark kent's character. It was completely balanced in all ways. Its a must watch movie for every one and in my opinion its not only the best movie of this summer but also the best comic book movie of all time. And yes with a better score also put in by Hans Zimmer. 10/10,2013
10,"I was a huge fan of the first season of Wentworth Prison when it was shown on Channel 5 in the UK last year. I thought the series proved to be a great 'standalone' drama with high quality production values, excellent writing and acting. The series at the same time also paid subtle and gracious homage to Prisoner, a special and ground breaking show. Well the second season doesn't disappoint, building on the quality of the first season, and it is mostly down to the clever introduction into the Wentworth mix of one character - Joan Ferguson. Pamela Rabe is simply brilliant as Joan Ferguson - taking on the mantle of one of the most iconic of TV characters and breathing a new 21st century life into her is no easy job, but Rabe achieves it, obviously relishing the opportunity to play such an unusual female character. Rabe's on screen presence, controlled physical stillness and a real glint in the eye hides an obvious wealth of feelings, which comes out in small doses throughout the season, in carefully played scenes where unexpected kindness and sincerity adds real depth to an already complicated individual. The 'new' Joan Ferguson has obvious OCD and abhors physical contact. Her compulsion to control every part of her environment (including her office) her staff and prisoners is wonderfully realised by Rabe, with a series of subtle physical ticks, cold stares and calculating mental games with everyone around her. Great use is made of prison security cameras which become Joan's 'All seeing eye'. Clever adaption of surgical gloves is used as a visual tease (and a wink) in the early episodes of what is to come from Joan later on. The writing, production and cast are universally excellent once again, with particular mention to Nicole da Silva and Danielle Cormack who play Frankie and Bea. As in the first season, the use of slow motion image capture and end sequence music is particularly effective. I for one can't wait for season three.",2014
8,"Initial skepticism of trying to remake a classic serial drama like Prisoner was quickly dispelled in the first few minutes of episode 1. This is a completely new take on a long running series from the 1980s with the necessary level of added grit needed in 2013. Whilst employing many of the well known character names; the ""new"" version has created juicy variations to the originals. Those familiar with the original series should not allow themselves to by put off in the early stages by casting of different types to play the original characters. Ep 1 was edgy, well paced and the acting overall was very good. If Wentworth can maintain the same intensity over its remaining 9 episodes of season 1, it will be a treat to watch. As well as seeing how the initial variation to different main characters develop, perhaps growing into their more familiar traits from the original series as the new series progresses. Clearly this re-make is attempting to tell the background story as to how the likes of Bea Smith, Vera Bennett, Meg Jackson and Frankie Doyle came to be like they were in the original Prisoner series.",2013
10,"This show is set in a womens prison in Australia, and tells the stories of the women who are in there. brilliant characters, from the intimidating and brave Frankie to quiet and dangerous Bea, and each one has their own story to tell. not only are there the women themselves, but great characters who are prison guards etc. as well from the lovable Vera to the strong minded Erica. Also uses violence and sex well, not over the top but keeps you excited for more. Bea is a worried mom who cares nothing more then for her daughters safety. a really great character and very well played. other characters to watch out for are Frankie, Jacs, Liz, Doreen, Vera, will, Erica, and Debbie. they are all very unique character but are played perfectly. exciting, thrilling at times, unique are words i would use to describe it. i would recommend it to anyone.",2014
9,"A tense, thrilling and grasping TV series. Very much underrated. I love prison based shows so i was a huge fan of this. It got straight to the point and doesn't disappoint. I cannot wait till its back. I also watch Orange is the new black but this concept is different because its more serious. You cannot compare the two even though both is based around womens prison unit. You do not have to like a certain genre to watch this or be super intelligent, you can simply enjoy it. I'm really upset hardly anyone I know doesn't watch it which is why i had to write this review as to why everyone should! Again like any other show there are characters you love and hate which is awesome I get so attached to them. It is not a typical storyline in an everyday prison is what i loved.",2015
10,"IM an old prisoner fan. queen Bea and her mates were fantastic. I was a bit reluctant about the remake. But i have to say its been amazingly good, gritty and fully entertaining. Wentworth is on its way to being just as good as prisoner cell block h, don't be put of because its not the same as the old one , in a lot of ways it can be better. you'll love it. The prison looks good. No wobbly sets. Some of the characters are still here, well in fact most of them are, You will find some have just been switched around. Its set before the original one. It gives the viewer a better idea of how and why things came to be, that in its self is making the whole first season.",2013
8,I have just started watching this and I so far i am extremely impressed.,2013
10,"I put off watching this for a long time, under the false impression that it would just be a different version of 'Orange Is The New Black' (which I do love, but am not really searching for shows similar to it because I don't particularly like jail/prison shows) but man was I wrong. It is NOTHING like OITNB. Their similarities begin and end with it being set in a female prison.",2016
10,"Just finished episode one of ""Wentworth"", the 2013 remake of the totally brilliant Prisoner Cell Block H, The characters names are the same, Erica, Vera Bennett, Bea Smith, Lizzie Birdsworth, Doreen Anderson, Mr Fletcher, even Frankie Doyle.",2013
10,"I started watching this a few days ago in Netflix. I'm in the US. I couldn't stop until I had finished season 2! It's definitely better than Orange is the New Black. It has much more depth & character. It's just more REAL, although not what prisons are like here in America. I first started watching shows about prison when Prison Break came out on Netflix, and I quickly became hooked. I know that one was entirely fiction but it was a fantastic program. Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat. While Orange is the New Black isn't bad, you're often left knowing that more happened, that there were things that were omitted either from the book or the show. With Wentworth you never get that feeling. You get to learn what these people struggle with, not just the prisoners, but also the guards and the administration. I can't wait til season 3 comes out, and I hope it gets released on Netflix!",2014
10,"A brilliant prequel to the fantastic series Prisoner Cell Block H. The focus of this series is basically how the young, innocent and abused Bea Smith becomes the infamous 'Top Dog' and Prison Officer ""Vera 'Vinegar Tits' Bennett becomes the nasty biatch we all know and love from the original series. While the main focus is on telling the story of Bea Smith and Vera Bennett, each episode tells a different story about how the additional prisoners became imprisoned.",2013
7,This show is surgically executed. It builds and builds and when you least expect erupts like a violent volcano. I warn you it can be bloody and violent but that's the shock of it because you don't see it coming. Just when you think it's become stable BOOM. THIS is the best prison show hands down. The casting and acting is out of this world. Each of the seasons finales are staggering. I've watched all 3 seasons and each is a prize waiting to behold. This series is brilliant. The way the lead has grown and transgressed is so awesome. I love this show. Orange is the new black I can't even watch after I first saw this. It literally changed the game. You don't understand how much of a favor you'd be doing your self by watching this incredible show. Bravo,2015
10,"When I read the summary for Wentworth I thought it was going to be an Orange is the New Black knock-off, but I was wrong. Australian prison drama Wentworth is a ruthlessly dark. It's tragic and gripping, it has a lot of characteristics of OZ. Wentworth's careful plotting is a great example of what can happen when a show actually tries. It's smart and well acted. I actually prefer this show to OITNB. It has more depth and character, it just more real and gritty, like OZ. After each episode I just wanted more and more. It nice to watch a show that isn't over advertised or filled with famous names to rely on viewer ship. Superb acting from all of the cast.",2015
10,"I was a big Prisoner fan when I was a kid. I was a bit unsure how this would pan out but it really is quality television. Great acting, casts and filming. The main characters are strong and lets face it Frankie and Erica are sexy, even if you aren't a lesbian lol! No wooden acting here, it all flows really well. ",2013
9,"What can I say a very good story line from the start explains all about Bea in greater detail. I watched the original prisoner cell block H I found it really good would be corny to watch now but was really sad when it eventually finished, however, on the bright side now I can really say this show as far far exceeded the original show. The actresses who plays Bea Franky and Ferguson are just brilliant and they make the program riveting they have also have really really good story lines many are very true to life. Really hope they carry on for many more series its one of the best shows to come out of Australia. Wish they could make the series longer, but really well done and carry on with the good work.",2014
9,"The only reason I am giving this show a 9 is because I can not call it my absolute favorite, but other than that? Superb!",2017
10,"I remember the original Cell Block H series and when I heard about this series I was a bit sceptical, no actually I was a LOT sceptical about it, hence the reason why it's taken me three years to watch the first series on Amazon Prime and I have to say I was blown away at just how good it really was. I started to watch Wentworth about three weeks ago and I am totally addicted to this show.",2016
10,"Wentworth is a brilliant show. It is about power, sociopathy and the continuum of good and evil that women inmates deal with. Every episode compares and contrasts the lengths that the inmates will go to, to survive and get what they need. Though the warden (and later inmate), Ferguson is clearly psychopathic and somewhat psychotic, her devious psychological manipulations are a wonder to behold. She has no capacity for empathy and has a razor sharp ability to discern and exploit weakness in others. The show is full of role reversals and surprises, twists and turns.The women are all criminals, but they are all victims too.",2016
10,"I watched the first 3 seasons of Wentworth and was impressed that a show I had never heard of was so good. After watching season 4, I have to say it was not as good as the first 3 but of course that all depends on if there is a season 5 or not. The first 3 seasons were non-stop intensity in which the characters developed both per episode and over the long story line. Season 4 completely switched gears and slowed down to where it was all about getting to the season finale. The first 3 seasons were so good, and the ending to season 3 so good I didn't actually think there would be a season 4. Now the only way to truly earn the 10 star rating I gave it based on the first 3 seasons is for them to make a season 5 and get back to the heart pounding pace at which Bea/Red takes on the world. It was nice to see her come to terms with many things and peace with many people in season 4, but it was to focused on the psycho ex-prison governor Furgeson. They should have just let her burn at the end of season 3 and let season 4 pickup where things had been going so well. On behalf of excitement of the first 3 seasons I'm giving the show a 10/10 rating. If there is no Season 5 then this rating will be update to reflect the serious change in what was the best prison drama I had seen to date. Makes OITNB seem like a kiddie show.",2016
8,"I don't love Australian TV in general, but this is easily twice as good as it's USA imitator 'orange is the new black'.",2016
10,"Only started watching Wentworth Prison a few weeks ago and so far I have loved every minute of it as I have caught up to where its currently at (Series 4, episode 7). It's definitely one of my favourite TV shows right now and I'm glad it has already been renewed for a 5th series at least.",2016
10,As of season 3 10/10 Loving the growth of the show. Season Three is gold Spoilers::: I feel for once I care about the screws even; before they always seemed a little wooden Vera aside. But the men have stood out and I'm routing for Fletch of all people and his widowed on/off mate Will.,2015
10,"My dad had recommended me to watch the Wentworth Prison TV series and I had fallen in love with it since the first episode. I had stayed up late just to watch some more episodes, I was that intrigued by it. I love Wentworth Prison and the characters in it, however I have to say I have fallen in love with the character Franky Doyle, she is one of the best bad ass characters in the series. It's also incredible with the effects and acting, even though its a remake of the series Prisoner: Cell Block H. I'd have to say it's much better and more violent, which is just perfect. This also shows how girls can be as bad ass, just as boys, which is another amazing thing due to these series. It has an amazing story backgrounds for the characters and it's very superb of how they hold the characters along through the series.This programme has become my second favourite and I hope this programme never ends.",2015
10,This show is so good. Im so be eager for Tuesdays to role around to watch it. You will not regret this show. Just watch the first two episodes and you will see. To the makers of this show thank you so much. I have been catching up on this show faithfully. I was once watch an episode and I jumped out of my seat with excitement. Thats how awesome it is. I tried watching this show about 6 months ago but I didn't get past the first 20 minutes because I had things going on and I forgot about it. I'm glad I did because it came in my life when I needed it the most. There is also an 3 season currently airing on TV. It is Australian so it may be difficult for some people to catch up with but the first 2 seasons are out there. People watch this show. I don't care how you find it but watch it. I encourage you to at least give it until you finish the first episode. Do not judge this show until you have watched the full first episode or if you can the first two episodes.,2015
10,"I first watched this show about a month ago and have become obsessed with it! In a months time I have rewatched it with my mother AND have started watching it again with my grandmother. Since Netflix only has seasons 1 and 2 I had to go online to watch all of the episodes of season 3 that have aired and I just can't get enough. I rewatch the episodes at night too! My obsession is enhanced by the character ""Franky"". Ugh I loooove Franky 😍. But I mainly decided to sign up on IMDb just to say that the few people I saw who said this series is terrible are MORONS! I am sorry but you have a serious error in judgment if you don't fall in love with this show! I totally understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but to say that people shouldn't even bother watching this show is ridiculous. As a matter of fact you are doing people a huge disservice by trying to deprive them of this MAGNIFICENT show! Australia I have got to give you props, you have created an amazing show and it just might be my all time favorite (and that says a lot).",2015
3,"With a current user rating of 8.3 and with ten - yes, 10 - ratings of 100 from the critics, I feel crazy not liking this movie. Critic Richard Roeper writes that ""I can't imagine anyone who loves movies not loving THIS movie."" ",2013
6,"Despite it's stellar cast and great production creds, ""American Hustle"" is little more than a sinners-with-a-heart of gold story. YAWN!!! It plays like a particularly sad Woody Allen movie without the jokes. The film is definitely not a comedy, though Jennifer Lawrence provides not only the best character but most of the few laughs the film has. ",2013
4,"I went into this movie with the highest of expectations simply because I did these type of gangster, conman, dramatic type of movies. However, about 20 minutes in I was waiting and waiting for that big climax, the first killing, the twist, etc etc. However, I was left empty and unfulfilled throughout the entire movie. ",2013
4,I really wanted to like this one. ,2013
4,"There is a very simple way to put this: I didn't believe it. That sums up the movie for me. Yes, there is all the razzle dazzle you can imagine. But there is nothing at the heart of this film. In Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, for example, I was an instant believer, I bought in immediately, and loved every second of the ensuing ride. Maybe I could tell from the trailers that we were going back to LaLa land territory. Schmooze, slick, and schtick. That's what this movie is. I was literally falling asleep. Because I never cared for a second, because I knew it was fake, the world never invited me in. Perhaps opening the movie with the old 'start halfway through the movie and then go back and show how they got to that point' tactic failed at bringing me believably along. I don't know, and it doesn't matter. The bottom line is I feel like I was never invited into a believable world. I guess it's just not that kind of movie. I had come to have high expectations after Russell's last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was emotionally invested, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the electric energy, the rockin' soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid. The believability comes from the characters and their relationships, set up by a story, or plot. Apparently Mr. Russell has lost the need for a plot as he is purported to have said when asked by Christian Bale whether the impromptu dialogue would change the story. While having a passion for characters and relationships is great, the story is an equally important element, and one that is lost here. This movie is thematically all over the place. There is little gravitas or gravity that keeps pulling us in its direction. We wander aimlessly through it, like a pimply teenager, awestruck at the glamour, not noticing that nothing is actually happening. This movie is all fluff. My favorite W.H. Auden quote also sums it up: ""What the mass media offers is not popular art but entertainment, which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish."" The same could not be said about The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. So far 2013 is a bad vintage.",2013
4,"First of all David O. Russell is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed his films and absolutely loved ""The Fighter"" and ""Flirting with Disaster"". This film also boasts an incredibly talented cast including Christian Vale, Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams.",2013
3,"This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch. It felt as though it was in love with itself and its whole depiction of 70s east coast disco Guido ""culture"" when in fact it was just an empty, pointless piece of bombast not half as clever as it thought it was. It felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last, and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on screen.",2013
6,"In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. David Russell reunites his cast from his previous best movies including 'The Fighter' and 'Silver linings playbook' to tell us the story of con artists who are led by the FBI to trap bigger fish in an attempt to expose corruption at high levels. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative. ",2013
9,'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A wonderfully acted and directed film.,2013
1,"Two key words for this movie: boring and ridiculous. I feel like because of the a-list casting for this movie the director felt like they could get away with an awful a movie, and unfortunately they probably will. I watched the film with the rest of my family, and not one of us enjoyed it. We wanted to stop watching halfway through, to be honest. Here are some of the main things (aside from a story told badly) that I found wrong with the movie: 1. Yes there were loads of actors that we all know, but the casting was still off. I thought Amy Adams was the wrong choice for this ""bad girl"" role, it felt weird to watch. Jennifer Lawrence I thought overacted. The rest of the actors however seemed to do what they could with the ridiculous script. 2. Some of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The point where I started out-loud laughing at the stupidity was when the FBI agent, Richie DiMaso , bashed up his boss, Stoddard Thorsen, and it was all fine. Oh man, that was some ridiculous stuff. Anyway, I could go on but I can't be bothered, I'm sure this movie will get loads of rewards and great reviews which it does not deserve, but people are easy to give in to the hype.",2014
1,"this movie was nominated for 10, yes, 10 Oscars. Sometimes, we see a year where cinema is not good so by default, they have to pick a movie to fill in the ballot. Obviously it didn't win any Oscars, and it shouldn't have. Christian Bale was nominated for best actor because he gained weight and did a Robert DeNiro impression the entire movie? Tom Hanks deserved best actor nod for Cpt Phillips. How come every time David O'Russell makes a movie, everyone is inclined that it is incredible, hilarious, moving, and nominated for 8+ Oscars. This movie tries to tell you the ABSCAM of the 70's, but in no way succeeded. The beginning shot is a title screen with a caption ""some of this actually happened"". During the movie I was confused on what was fictional, semi-reality, intended to be a comedy? Nobody hustled anybody in this movie either. It was a terrible explanation of events, mixed with big actors in silly 70's outfits. I heard people in the audience at the theater ""look at her hair! Look at that outfit!"" People were interested in the costume design than the movie. If you have a ton of alcohol, drink it before watching this movie. Because during the middle of it, you will be wondering why you weren't.",2014

9,"Many films nowadays fall victim to the trap of self-sacrifice--sacrificing characters for the sake of the plot, sacrificing the plot for the sake of characters, sacrificing intelligence for a visual escape, etc. The list runs long. 'American Hustle', on the other hand, sacrifices nothing. It is greedy in terms of wanting everything and achieving a step more. It is ambitious in being ambitious. It is beautiful. It is the best movie of 2013. ",2013

3,"I am absolutely astounded by all of the fantastic reviews this movie has gotten by the critics and users on this site. Did we not watch the same movie? I was so bored about an hour into this show that I almost fell asleep watching it. This movie was at least 30 minutes too long and so over acted it was ridiculous. It looks to me like the only reason this movie had all of the big name stars in it (Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, etc.) was to insure a big box office draw because they could have done this film just as easily with mostly unknowns and saved themselves about 30-35 million dollars.

Lets all wait for the 2014 year and hope that these actors and directors make better decisions and that we'll make up for the huge and greatly disappointing movie we all just had to witness like I said these actors have all seen better days and I'm sorry but they were ""conned"" into being in this one.",2013

Is it an old feud that's gone on for generations and finally came to it's breaking point? Or is it simply an accident? One thing is for sure, there is a dead body and a detective who is on the case. He is skilled and insightful. ",2014

It is so sad when viewers look at a series like this and criticize it as being dismal and depressing, it's about murder and I'm thinking that is pretty depressing at the best of times. The scenery and lifestyle of the Shetlands is totally unique and while it isn't for everyone learning about this amazing culture is well worth the effort. I can't say enough bout the acting it is superb and the accents are definitely toned down so we can understand them. All in all a job well done by all concerned which definitely does credit to Ann Cleve's amazing writing. Thank you and please keep them coming.",2016
8,"After a good pilot and a fairly good first full series I feel that Shetland is starting to come into its own, this second full series has started in fine form, it's somehow more slick, more meaty, the stories seem a bit bigger.",2016
8,"The recipe for comfort-detective-television is well established, starting with a community that is close-knit, picturesque and cursed with an improbably high murder rate, and adding a brooding, lonely, middle-aged male detective. And to an extent, 'Shetland' is pure formula milk. But there's something in the spectacular landscape that makes the stories affecting; and even if the role is thin, Douglas Henshall manages to invest it with a convincing, emotional gravitas that goes beyond what's written in the script. The plots aren't too bad either, although the low-key style (reiminiscent of the BBC version of 'Wallander') tends to defuse their dramatic effect. If allowed to run too long, this series will doubtless stale; but for the moment, it's still feels fresh, and as raw as the harsh Shetland climate.",2014
7,"OK, so this wasn't a groundbreaking detective drama. The mystery plot was good (it kept me interested and I wasn't able to work out ""whodunit"") but it was nothing special.",2013
7,"This crime drama opens on the island of Bressay, part of Shetland, where an elderly woman is shot and killed. DI Jimmy Perez is soon on the case. Being a small community there aren't a huge number of suspects but it turns out there are a surprising number of motives. The victim had been allowing an archaeological team to dig on her land and they had recently discovered a skull that they believed was five hundred years old; she thought it may be much younger though. As DI Perez investigates he learns of connections to the 'Shetland Bus'; the wartime transport to occupied Norway and of a visiting professor who made a habit of getting close to his female students amongst other things. Before long there is a second death and he will have to work quickly to solve the case before a team from the mainland arrive to take over.",2013
10,We discovered the series this Spring 2016 – the third series. Hooked quickly on the well-played drama. Having lived in Glasgow some years as a student enjoy a good Scottish accent and love the nature they present on the series.,2016
8,"The 6 episode second season is a gripping, complex tale with not just the one murder that starts it, but eventually a handful. Characters and plot are introduced and revealed bit by bit, in a way that keeps you wanting more.",2016
9,I really liked to watch the 3 seasons and I cant wait for the 4! There will be a season 4 right? ,2016
9,"This is a wonderful series ...I'm watching S1 & S2 again for the 2nd time in less than a month. The writing is great, so is the acting, the characters are3-D & interesting, not from stock. The stories do share some sameness...there's a murder (maybe 2) in a small, place that's fairly isolated, in one part or other of the Shetland Isles. There's several potential suspects. The stories & mysteries are the kind that seem like what could happen in any small town, village, or big city, for that matter; the types of things that happen to real people, as opposed to dramatic, wild, over-the-top happenin's. Not as cozy as a drawing room mystery, but easy to relate to.",2017
7,"It is a bit slow but it is a more moody, setting driven show to me. I love where they are filming it. I tried to find the beautiful island they just had episode 5 and 6 on, but I did not see it listed anywhere. Can someone post the name of that island. Just stunning. The first few shows the filmed had a gray tone in the filming, (not the stories). I read they actually used filters to dull down the vivid colors to create more of a ""mood"". Now they seemed to have accepted the fact that they are filming in a beautiful location and letting it shine. I could watch this show just for the scenery really. The mysteries are good, they are not usually the person you think who did it. There is usually an old story revealed to tell us who did it. People's histories and back stories. Which I like. I like the Jimmy Perez character. He seems like such a loving and solid man. I wish I could meet a guy like him! I hope they do a 2nd series. I enjoyed my time with Shetland.",2014
9,"I have watched many police stories over the years and this is at the top of my list as one of the best of all time. It compares quite favorably with Midsomer Murders, another of my favorite shows. I actually put off watching the 2017 premiere of Game of Thrones so that I could finish watching season three of the show. Especially living in Southern California, and specifically in the inland Valley, it is comforting to know that some places on this planet are not hotter than Hades.",2017
10,"I watched seasons 1-3 by myself, then again with my wife. For several years we-ve watch almost 100% police procedurals; 8 to 16 hours per week. This is one of the very best series in any market in our opinion.",2017
10,"A truly excellent detective series with a different feel thanks to the little known location. The wind and rain swept treeless Shetland location gives a wonderfully authentic atmosphere to the tried and true detective series. I became hooked on Scandinavian detective series through watching Mhz Worldview, particularly as I liked the alternative to London and New York settings which highlight the fact that there is a whole other world out there - a world of small communities where everyone is related to everyone else and the few small towns are like villages where everyone is a family.",2017
10,"I loved this series! The characters are multi-dimensional, the plots are always very suspenseful without being gruesome. I saw someone else say the show sometimes moved slow (although enjoyable) and I would say the pace is perfect because the viewer is allowed to think alongside DI Perez. The acting is superb. So is the cinematography. I am so looking forward to the next season as it's become a favorite in my household!",2017
9,"I just found this show on Netflix,love it. Binged it until series 3.Can't wait till 4. I like the way it builds the layers of each charter. And wow Scotland is beautiful. Always wanted to go, but now....Guess I'll have to win the lottery. I truly love watching Perez puzzle out each mystery. You can read it on his face with him even having to use words.",2017
9,"Douglas Henshall as Det. Insp. Jimmy Perez and the remote location of Shetland are the main attractions of this superb British drama. Perez is a man with a good heart who takes on each murder case as if the family survivors depend entirely on him. He's the sort of guy you want to have on your side. The setting is spectacular but the climate is harsh; cold, grey, damp. You feel like you're right there with them. The murders do not have simple explanations and often involve a web of intrigue. Perez will hunt them down, whether its clan warfare in Shetland or a crime syndicate in Glasgow. Perez (his family name comes from his Portuguese father) has a close friend and rival in Duncan Hunter, a local councillor. Played by Mark Bonnar, Duncan is in a relationship with Perez's ex-wife and is a surrogate father to his teenage daughter. This is an area of contention because Jimmy cares deeply for his daughter and faces the challenge of not being in control. Used to dealing with criminals, he fears the worst for the one he loves most. The stories are from British author Ann Cleeves. The series is a fine piece of work in the tradition of British mystery writing and film-making. It is also one of many great television shows that have come out of Britain and Scandinavia in recent years along with Borgen, The Bridge, Broadchurch, Wallander. Shetland and the others are what great television is about.",2017
8,"Being an extensive country with numerous distinct folks and regions, the UK has an endless potential to ""fit in"" crimes not into bigger cities only. Motives for crimes are all-round and vicious minds can produce different forms and methods to shake the pillars of small/distant communities as well - although apparently not so often as depicted in series with multiple seasons...",2016
10,"Absolutely love this contemporary Scottish series. Wonderful acting, authentic dialects, superb plots that keep you guessing. I haven't guessed one right yet! The scenery is sparse but beautiful, offsetting the overall gray skies in this part of the world. I can see how this series has received so many nominations (and a win). My family is addicted to this one.",2017
8,A thoroughly enjoyable detective series that captured the unique and exquisitely beautiful Shetland Islands. The story lines and characters were well done. Doug Henshall was excellent as Perez as well as a supporting cast equally as talented. I especially enjoyed season 3 that spent the entire time on one case. I am hoping that Netflix will offer season 4 in the near future.,2017
10,"Why i rated this 10/10? Well for starters, i was an extra in this film!!! I had to work so hard in this film, every scene was so detailed, i had to walk back and forth and back and forth. When i finished acting in the film, we had to wait for it to be published. I enjoyed the idea of the wait. When i watched this film, i really recalled how amazing Shetland really is, as i to live here in Shetland. The landscape used was good, i recognized the places easily. The acting in the movie is of a good standard. I saw myself a lot!!!! Yeah! I would definitely watch this crime drama, as its beautifully acted out and the plot is attractive!",2013
8,"If you like Hinterland, or really any British copper show, you'll like this.",2016
10,"Authentic, original and extremely entertaining. Shetland is a well-kept secret in the US. Wonderfully written and acted. Equals Sherlock. Guest stars are amazing and among the elite in the UK. Just watched season 3 and binged the entire 6 episodes in a few days. Its one-story line kept me going until the end. Unpredictable and lovely. Love this show.",2017
10,"I loved the first two seasons of Shetland and I'm looking forward to seeing more. Douglas Hensall is gorgeous as DI Perez, he has a strong beautiful nature that is always thinking of others. Steven Robertson and Alison O'Donnell are so great as his DC's. I love the feeling of ""family"" in this series. I really hope this become a long running series that will keep us intrigued for years to come. Well done guys!!",2017
10,"Beautiful scenery, laid back pace but still a gripping series with great characters. Shetlands the location itself is a fantastic character. ",2017
2,"Having watched the first Hunger Games with some appreciation, I was decidedly eager to watch the second. How wrong I was.",2014
7,"An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.",2014
5,"I have neither seen the first movie, nor read the book. So I should admit that I am an outsider to this Hunger Games hype. However, high expectations for this sequel among the fans and high rating at IMDb tempted me to watch it. The first thing I do not really get is 8.3 rating here. My ratings and IMDb ratings have never fallen that apart in recent years!",2013
1,"Before you catch fire this weekend, be sure to rewatch THE HUNGER GAMES, because for the first half of this brooding, inferior sequel, the characters do nothing but wallow in their extremely complicated past ",2013
1,"This elaborate mess of a movie couldn't be more boring and silly. The premise is astoundingly dumb, far worse than the original and a non existent plot you can see coming a mile away.",2013
5,"Catching Fire is basically a remake of the first movie, which doesn't offer even one single new idea, just the easiest excuse to send the winning couple back to the games and repeat everything that happened in the first movie.",2014
3,"Really childish movie, this planet is going dumber by the minute. Obviously the dudes well-connected enough to write for Hollywood can't  umm  write. ",2013
1,"Don't waste money, no story, you don't feel for the characters. The end is so abrupt every one was waiting that at least director would give one good scene, but credits appear.",2013
5,"I went to see this movie after seeing that in IMDb, it got a rating of 8.3 out of 10. Even though I saw some bad reviews about it, I was certain that a movie that got such a high rating in this kind of site must have something to offer. My god was I wrong. Where do I begin?",2013
1,"OK, I'm not sure how I can review this one without dropping a few spoilers here and there, so I marked this one as ""contains spoilers"", just in case. First, you need to know the point of view from which I approached this movie...in order to understand why I rated it awful. I did not read the books. I did not read any of the books. In fact, I can't remember a single book I have read in the past 10 years or so. I *DID* however see the first movie in the series, Hunger Games. I went to see Hunger Games only because I'd read it was a really good movie. I was NOT disappointed. Hunger Games (the first movie) was one of the best movies I have ever seen! 10/10, simply awesome!!!",2013
1,"I really don't see how this movie has a good rating to begin with. I guess the studios are like the capitol in the movie. They probably paid off the critics. I was lucky enough to wait til it was available to rent. I really enjoyed the first hunger games because it kind of felt like the novel 1984. Catching fire switched more to a twilight love issue between Peeta and Gale. First Katiness wants to run off with Gale, but he refuses because he wants to join the revolution. Then she starts falling in love with Peeta during the Games (Woohoo, another twilight!).",2014
9,"I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early, since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US, and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans, even though my English is not even that good: Catching Fire is a GREAT experience, and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.",2013
2,"After winning the seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return home to District 12. They go back to their old routine (kind of; they now live in the Victor's Village, and possess terrific wealth) with Katniss and Gale hunting together, Peeta baking and isolating himself, and Haymitch getting very drunk. Katniss shows major signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.",2014
10,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", is a more then solid sequel to 2012's ""The Hunger Games"". ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games, The Quarter Quell, a competition that could change Panem forever. The Quarter Quell for the seventy fifth games are that the tributes will be reaped from the existing victors. Katniss must make choices that will put herself and her family in danger of being killed. She and her fellow tribute Peeta must train once again for another games, but this time they must make allies as everyone who they are fighting against know one another, Katniss and Peeta are the outsiders. The Directing in this film is very well done and very smooth. ""Francis Lawrence"" boosted the game from the previous film in the franchise, which was directed by ""Gary Ross"". The difference between the two directors is that ""Francis Lawrence"" is a visionary which clearly stands out in the film. ""Jennifer Lawrence"" once again did a fantastic job as Katniss Everdeen but unfortunately ""Josh Hutcherson"" didn't quiet reach the heights of the last film as Peeta Mellark and its hard to say but ""Josh Hutcherson"" kind of sucks in this film. ""Sam Claflin"" did a fantastic job playing Finnick Odair as well as ""Jena Malon"" Playing another secondary character Johanna Mason. Although ""Jena Malons"" Johanna Mason was easily a scene stealer. Which bring me to the characters, the secondary characters in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" are sensational and they have some enormous character development throughout the movie, as well as Katniss and Peeta. The Cinematography in this film couldn't get better, which is another improvement over the first movie as there is no shaky cam. ""James Newton Howards"" composition of the Score was amazing with the standouts being, ""The Tour"", ""A Quarter Quell"", ""Lets Start"" and ""Arena Crumbles."" There are 29 songs in the score. Lastly The Special Effects in this film are very good in some parts but noticeable in other parts. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" improved enormously over its predecessor with better acting by ""Jennifer Lawrence"", smooth directing by ""Francis Lawrence"", great characters and good special effects. I give 2013's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" a 10/10.",2016
9,"The Hunger Games was great. Catching Fire is a masterpiece. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss, and Josh Hutcherson is great as Peeta. This film is a large improvement over it's predecessor, with less shaky can, and more scenes in District 12. They also toned down the love triangle, which is great. The addition of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee is great, and the story-line is good as well. The Games were portrayed very well, and the action was pulse-pounding. However, the Careers were much less of a threat than in the first film, and Katniss doesn't do hand-to-hand combat at all. Those are the only bad stuff I can think of, since the film was great, and there wasn't a single dull moment in it. All the new tributes were interesting, especially Finnick, Johanna and Beetee. This film is great, and is a must-watch.",2016
1,"Where do I begin? Of course the length. It's just ridiculously long, without anything that would make the viewer interested in, without principles or a cause. The main protagonist is a dumb little girl who can't even fathom her convictions, let alone hold on to them. She has a guy loving her, working in the MINES, while she's pretending not to like the parade of her and her ""victorious"" boyfriend from the games and all the posh show-off that happens. When the guy opens up to her and shows her that more than *she* matters, and the fact that he won't just run off with her, while all the rest stay in misery, all she can do is just leave. Then there's the other (long) part of the movie where she just starts to create this whole different relationship, while her lover is left behind the screen. What sort of morality is this movie trying to portray? Is this what the western world is moving towards to? Just awful.",2013
2,"Really, this movie has a quite nice prologue ... but as it turns out its all prologue. We see the home front, then a tour of the provinces, followed by the splendour of the capital. A spectacular triumph for the survivors of the gladiatorial games of the past. All the competitors are given a nice blade-runner like intro sequence. They each have a 'special skill' (ie. sort of a super-power). Just in case you missed this, they get another intro via an all-live all-province glammed up TV interview. Very flash! But it is all building up to the 'games' and when we finally get to those games they are over before they really get started.",2013
1,"I am so disappointed in this movie. I loved the first movie. This movie has maybe 5 minutes of plot spread out over 2+ hours. This movie should really have been a 5 minute epilogue on the first movie or, better yet, a 5 minute intro sequence on the next one - the impact would have been much greater.",2014
4,"After a massive let down from watching the first movie, I was surprisingly curious enough to wonder where the story would go in the second. My main issue in the first film was a lack of a compelling and believable story, but I walked in the theater to see this one anyway, hoping the film makers sought redemption for what was so abysmal. It didn't surprise me much however to find that story was once again dry, rigid, and crusted over with garbage, just like a dog turd on a summer sidewalk.",2013
9,"Derek Waters brings his hilarious web series to comedy central, with bigger production values and entertainers replacing historians as the drunken storytellers. The two episodes I've seen of Drunk History are some of the most hilarious and entertaining television I've ever seen. The premise is actors/writers/comedians get drunk and tell a story from history, and the scenes described and narrated are acted out. So far, my favorite was where Adam Scott played John Wilkes Booth in the recreation of the Lincoln assassination. Some recognizable names play some of the historical figures; Jack Black was great as Elvis, Dave Grohl as Elivs's lackey, Jonathan Ames, Adam Scott, and Will Forte as Junius, John Wilkes and Edwin Booth, and Fred Willard as 'Deep Throat' in the recreation of the Watergate scandal. The funniest part, to me, is the dialogue the drunken historians give the historical figures that the actors then lip sync. I could use a bit less of the storyteller's vomiting...though, I'm aware that usually goes over well with comedy central's young male demographic. This series has great potential, and I hope it will find the success it deserves.",2013
8,"Wow. I'm normally a bit hypersensitive to ""make-work"" programs for talented thespians, and ""Drunk History"" could sorta be described that way.",2013
6,"The premise of ""Drunk History"" is simple. You have someone sit down and talk about important historical moments in American history....but first you get them drunk and keep them drinking throughout the episode. As they (often) terribly narrate history, various actors (often very famous folks) act out the history and spew the profanity-laden dialog.",2015
10,"OK this show is addictive! This has to be the best (and probably only) educational comedy every made! There isn't one episode I didn't learn something, or laugh out loud! Want to make America smarter? Add this show as required curriculum at every high school in America. For that matter, create more shows like this for every subject! Bravo to the creator and producers of this gem of a show! A perfect 10/10 (also my History test score!) from me",2017
9,"as my summary states, unfortunately on my own behalf... i can attest to the multitude of drunken states of our narrators. i am and always have been (at least of the comprehensible age) been ""that drunk guy"". the thing that makes me love this show so damn much, the drunker i get... the smarter i feel, the more i know, the absolute truth comes from deep within.",2014
9,"A very unique approach to telling history, I must say. I like how they usually start off at a bar and get some introspection from intelligent people regarding what the ultimate discussions will be about. ",2015
10,"Some of these reviewers are absolutely clueless. This show is hilarious. ""Uneven""??? They're drunk, you ding dong. The one who wrote ""I love history and I love comedy"" - dude, maybe Bob Hope is more up your alley if you're not getting Drunk History...Paget Brewster is...genius. Love this show - keep 'em coming, Derek. i do some college teaching and when the kids are a bit stressed I'll show them a scene or two from drunk history to lighten their mood a bit - this show is the best. I usually watch episodes multiple times because at first, I find myself more engaged by the story itself; after re-watching I can fully appreciate the pure comedy. Loved the First Ladies episode and Laura Dern's episode as well.",2015

8,"If you are looking for a show that is uniquely funny, Drunk History is the show for you. The concept is so fresh and original that I find myself telling people to check out the show without telling them anything about it. I feel as though going into this show blindly (as I did) makes for a better first-watch and intrigues you to want to watch more. ",2018
1,This was recently recommended to me. So I gave it a shot. Watched the episode that included The Alamo. And another one that included Lewis and Clark. I could see this being mildly amusing as a skit on Mad TV or SNL. By the end of the second episode it had worn me out. Watching people get drunk is not funny. Listening to them tell stories - badly - is not funny. The miming is marginally amusing. I find myself wanting to reach into the TV and strangle the narrators. I'm embarrassed for the actors. I'm humiliated recalling all the times I was drunk and telling crappy stories in the company of my non-drinking friends. Now I know what an asshole I sounded like.,2016
2,This is by far the worst show on Comedy Central. I have loved all of their other shows that I have seen. Tosh.0 is good as well and Inside Amy Schumer and the Jeselnik Offensive. This show is not funny in away way. I was not expecting a history show but I was expecting some comedy. It is COMEDY central after all.,2013
1,"I have watched this show because I love history and love comedy, I was, however, sorely disappointed by the result... It is exactly what the title claims it to be, history for someone that failed their history classes due to being high or drunk and it is presented as such as if by an illiterate and extremely ineloquent teacher. ",2014
1,"An idea that could have possibly made a decent 10 minute skit on a comedy show like SNL, if only it was a little bit funny. I couldn't watch this garbage longer than 5 minutes. There is so much wrong with this dribble.. it's pretentious, vapid, boring, stupid (in an unfunny way), and most of all, totally UNFUNNY. This is the worst piece of crap I've seen on cable in a very very long time! I need more words and lines for this submission, so here they are.. This show sucks! It really really really does! Suck, that is! Really, it does! Totally!!!",2014
1,"To be fair to the series, I already knew I wouldn't like it when I decided to watch one, but I found the casting of Weird Al Yankovic as Adolf Hitler absolutely impossible to resist... I HAD to see that, even if I had to sift through 30 minutes of garbage to find it. And actually, Weird Al was excellent... wish his part had been bigger.",2015
2,"Fist I read I review I find actually more humorous than the show as it inferred that in between the humor you may learn something about history. My guess is the shows creators would also find that funny as hell. One the other hand assuming the comment was serious you really have to wonder about this shows target market. Personally I love Adult Swim, the Cartoon Network and adult humor. I have watched a few of these shows and personally don't find them funny at all (maybe the first 10 minutes of the first show, after that every episode seems sort of based on the same gag. If the writing was better this could be a great show in terms of intellectual humor. Instead it seems more slapstick as the more the actor talks the more absurd the humor becomes , if you can find humor in it. Besides the writing the acting really is pretty bad. Acting drunk is likely not easy while at the same time having to recite lines that I guess are meant to become lamer by the minute. I feel embarrassed frankly for those involved and once again the premise of drunken distortion of history gets old quickly when the writing sucks. Finally the entire concept of making light of those loosing control while drinking and trying, and not succeeding, to get people to laugh at the drunk just strikes me wrong for some reason. And just to make clear I not a religious person so comments coming from that angle, I admit I am likely older than the target audience (55 and a professional) but I have none the less never been accused of being overly mature. ",2016
7,"First let me say that this is a great show. It's highly entertaining and it does actually teach history. However it's been my experience that in most episodes, at least one ""fact"" isn't actually true. One of the biggest falsehoods is the claim that Alexander Graham Bell stole the telephone from Elisha Gray. This is not true. Both men filed for patents on the exact same day and Bell's patent was not a copy of Gray's. In fact Gray's design was a variation of one Bell had come up with a year earlier. So really it was Gray who copied Bell, not the other way around. Another big falsehood is the claim that Patty Hearst woke up one day and was completely won over by her captors. The truth is she was beaten, raped and never allowed to go outside without armed escorts. Her life was under constant threat and she was always under duress. Pictures taken during the bank robbery show that some of her captors were pointing guns at her to make sure she played along. Most episodes don't have inaccuracies as big as these but they often have small ones. For example, Stetson Kennedy was not a down and out salesman but a published journalist and author. Also the phrase ""banana republic"" did not come from Sam ""The Banana Man"". It was coined by the author O'Henry years before Sam ever became involved in Honduran politics. Aside from inaccuracies like these, this is still a great show. It's absolutely hilarious and I always learn something new when I watch it.",2016
9,"Let me assure you, as you read through these reviews, those that rated this series low have no sense of humor whatsoever. They think they know what they're talking about, they don't. This series is absolutely hilarious. Those that gave this bad reviews are certainly taking things far too seriously. The condescending, pretentious, asinine reviews some gave are utterly ridiculous; and an exercise in douchebaggery. Do not believe the d-bags and the pompous brit reviews. Judge for yourself. Sit back with a drink and enjoy this truly funny take on history.",2017
10,"Being a tad of a teetotaler myself and an extremely avid history fan (I have my bachelor's in history), the show feels made for me. The best part of the show is when the actors are mimicking the drunk storyteller's words. It's so random and comical. I've actually learned a great deal about history from this show while being ultra entertained with humor. Not many shows can boast that they actually teach people something without it coming off as ultra boring. In fact, this show may be the first of it's kind, a maiden voyage of connecting knowledge and humor in television. I guess my one critique would be that I've enjoyed it more with 2 stories per episode (or even 1) instead of 3, so the storyteller can delve deeper into the topic and characters. With 3 stories an episode, it feels a bit more flimsy information wise. For example the Hamilton by Lin Manuel Miranda. Which by the way, that Hamilton episode is seriously one of the greatest things ever created by man. The two girls Aubrey and Alia are simply off the chain and Lin's account has so much depth. We can just get so much more connected with the characters when it's a 1 or 2 story episode. Regardless, I love it, and keep em coming.",2017
4,I think you lot need to go over to the UK version firstly we can handle drunk a lot better and the narrating is much funnier. Maybe I'm biased because i didn't find the American version funny at all.

10,"Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as ""A Crowd Pleaser,"" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.",2013

7,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning performances.",2013
8,"Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010,  Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked  well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of  romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996,  McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To  Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like,  critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.  In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer,  a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some  of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in  what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent  memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be  casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.  While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time  span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of  McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and  proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like  himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction  Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in  heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient  Ron Woodruff.  For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally  well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron  Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money  throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling,  chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and  his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't  until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized,  giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives  of many others.  Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty  day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his  hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested  medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of  AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United  States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a  close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the  ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced  doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral  treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic  money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the  realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working.  Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the  two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for  paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the  FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks  to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic,  homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his  opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual  discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors  physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic  forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty  amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon.  Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and  grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The  Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical  spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a  candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal  struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the  United States in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and  edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for  wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic.  Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to  be a part of.  Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at  this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their  is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon.  His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a  large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's  dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will  surely be rewarded.  Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting  effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of  the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park  living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not  AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government  fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful  companies is wealth, or health.  Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic  based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate  condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires  others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the  powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled  in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto  ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized,  passionate display of what it's like to die ""with your boots on"";  dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.",2013

10,"This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie. It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That is, it adds to the story.",2013

10,"After watching this film, I've run out of glowing superlatives to describe it. First of all, a word on Matthew McConaughey. I've always thought of him as a relative lightweight in the film world, the sexy leading man best designed for selling tickets and little else. I am happy to report that I was mistaken. Sadly, horribly mistaken. From the very first frame of this amazing movie, I was so amazed at his physical transformation that it took a half an hour just to adjust my eyes to the frail creature I saw before me. But it was real, just as his stellar performance both illuminated the way I look at the entire AIDS epidemic and the toll it takes on humanity, both gay and straight. This film happily avoided all previous clichés and typical treatments of the subject matter, transcending every other film I have seen regarding HIV/AIDS. For so long I have decried the serious lack of great film for ADULTS, with seemingly everything out today designed for pre-pubescent teenaged boys interesting in nothing more than mindless video games and moronic super hero sequels. As with many memorable independent films, this gem was elevated to heroic status with the incredible acting of McConaughey, in concert with the amazing Jaret Leto, providing the perfect foil to his perfect, character-driven role. Every, single reason for going to the movies is present in the glorious truth and humanity of this landmark effort, a ""must-see' for anyone seeking superior acting in profusion. If there's a God in heaven, Matthew and Jaret should both win the Academy Awards for Best Performance by a Leading Man, and Best Supporting Actor. Each actor went far beyond mere ""acting"" in this film, becoming so entirely immersed into character that they stopped acting and just BECAME. Don't miss this important and moving film.",2013
10,"At times Mr. McConaughey's acting abilities may have been in question, but doubtless there has always been a genius just waiting to explode. And explode it does in Dallas Buyers Club. Given a fully explored and developed character, he is the centrifugal force of the engaging plot of an American tragedy, seamless direction, lively dialogue and creme de la creme supporting actors. This actor, who proves he can blur the lines between acting and real, rises to the ranks of Dustin Hoffman, Sean Penn, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, our Grand Pere, Jack Nicholson, and his own idol, Paul Newman. Unquestionably, he deserves a spot in Academy Awards for Best Actor. At long last, given the opportunity, he has proved to possess truly exquisite talent; to be an actor's actor, worthy of study, deep respect, even awe. He skillfully brings to life an oddball cowboy character to the level of hero, and mesmerizes the audience at every single breath, by every stretch of his emaciated gorgeous heart, soul and body. Shirts off to Matthew McConaughey, and may you never doubt his abilities again.",2013
9,"At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, patients were advised to wait. In the six years following the first recording of the AIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while waiting. In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then Vice President George H.W. Bush has been quoted as saying ""If you want change, change your behavior."" Roger Ebert recalls, ""Politicians did not want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted admitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care workers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes refused to accept the corpses."" ",2013

In Mexico he gets introduced to new drugs that help with HIV and AIDS but they are not FDA approved. Here starts the battle of Woodroff VS the FDA. He starts his own club where he treats people with AIDS and HIV, thats the main plot. Acting wise Matthew Mconganuey gives his career best performance, he lost almost 100 pounds for his role, and he stuns with such a mature and spellbinding performance. But Jared Leto steals the show, he touches new heights with DBC, his performance is award worthy. The films minuses are the slow pace and excessive length.Overall this film is path breaking because the subject of AIDS has not been talked about much in films, its a must watch for all cinema lovers.",2013

It took me a while but then it dawned upon me that this is what I felt when I first watched Daniel Day-Lewis portray the Academy Award Winning role in LINCOLN.

While Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack's screenplay serves the subject all- too familiarly from one-note borderline redneck to patron saint somewhere in between it is the clear eyes direction by Jean-Marc Vallee and his star's amazing acting skills in making an unlikable reprobate something we all recognize: all too human in an unjust world. Leto is equally remarkable as a transvestite homosexual who become Woodroof's aide-de-camp and best friend in the process while Garner's green doctor balances out as a medical professional learning the knotty ropes of big pharma tactics.

8,"Dallas Buyer Club is a great American biographical drama film! Co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. Set in the 1980s, the movie tells the story of a real-life AIDS patient, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS. Fighting against the orders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ron must try to manage his 'Dallas Buyers Club"" while facing the opposition from the government agency that originally sent out to protect him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while the movie is based on true events, it's also highly fictional. A good example of this, is the supporting characters of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Ron's transgender friend, Rayon (Jared Leto). Both were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. While, some critics might see these examples of artistic license as offensive, due those whom resent the reinterpretation of real event historical events; I saw it as a huge colleague improvement. After all, both Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto did very well in their roles. Jared Leto even won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his accurate depiction of a fictional transwoman with HIV who helps Woodroof. To portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body to look the part. Nevertheless, it wasn't as extreme, as Matthew McConaughey had to go, through, as Ron Woodroof. McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds, just to play the role in the film. The severity of the weight loss for these actors is getting way too dangerous. I can see McConaughey having problems, later in his life, because of this. Despite that, he was amazing in this movie. Kinda glad, he won Best Actor for this movie. However, while Woodroof was known for peculiar eccentric behavior, according to those who knew him; both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, with all the rampantly homophobic. Due to this, a lot of critics, believe that the portrayal of Woodroof in the beginning of the film, was very inaccurate and somewhat offensive, when many saw him, as a man that didn't harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. While, many of these real-life accounts are indeed mixed. Here is some truth about the guy. The real-life man did do hard drugs, and had a lot of sex, but also he was a family man, unlike the one, we saw in this film. I kinda do, hate the fact, that the movie cut this fact off from the story, because in my opinion, his ex-wives, family members and a daughter could help, push the character study, along, its character development. Despite all that, I do love, how the movie makes the main character transforms from a rotten person to a heroic one. Yes, he starts out as a homophobic, bigoted, promiscuous drug user, but he become very likable, over the course of the story, when he learns to take care of himself, eat healthy, and learns to appreciate and love others regardless of who they are. This is better than most tragic movies, are willing to give us. While, the movie's ending is bittersweet. I love the anti-corporate message demonstrated through drug companies' heartless action. It's true about what Woodroof says about the FDA. A good example of this, is the dangers of AZT when use to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. While, it's true that high doses of this drug is indeed toxic, it's also true, that AZT has worked for many patients at an appropriate dose. The use of AZT as a way to treat HIV/AIDS is still a highly target controversial, medical debate, even today. Just note that the drug does somewhat work, in small doses. Another good thing about this film is allowing the audience, in rethinking their apparent anti-gay sentiments. It indeed, changed a lot of opinions of straight people had on gay people. It also introduce mainstream audiences, to a realistic portrayal of transgender, outside of Comedy or Indies films. I love, how this movie was filmed. Lots of symbolism with the idea of riding the bull, sequences. Loves all the close up, and bait and switch camera movements as well. However, there were some historic inaccurate with some of the sets and props in this film. It's funny, noticing somethings in the background that clearly wasn't there in the 1980s. Overall: the diagnosis for this rodeo of movie has fine performances which are the highlights of Dallas Buyers Club, but you don't want to go believing too much of its history. The movie takes many shortcuts, compressing and compacting its story that it's hard to tell, which sequences are fiction and which are the truth. In the end, it's best for you to watch it, and judge yourself. I do recommended it.",2016
9,"After ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" I'd thought I'd seen all of the serious best actor candidates for this year. That was before I'd seen Matthew McConaughey's performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". The performance is simply outstanding: less showy that DiCapprio's in ""Wolf""; certainly less worthy than Ejiofor's in ""Slave""; but in my book, this would get my vote if I were an Oscar or BAFTA voter. He is nominated which is good: but he won't win I fear.",2014
6,"In the interest of balance (and as a clue to the filmmaker's intentions), it's worth noting that many friends and associates of the real life Ron Woodruff have attested that he was not remotely homophobic and worked happily alongside gays. Some even thought he was gay, or at least bi. (Interviews with these people can easily be found online). In choosing to depict Woodruff as a redneck homophobe Dallas Buyers Club rather self-consciously opts for an unquestionably straight hero, while almost entirely airbrushing gays out of the picture. It also defames a real life hero who has nobody left to defend him. The truth, of course, is that the Dallas Buyers Club, like many similar ventures at the time, was largely run by gay activists. But they are nowhere to be seen here. Instead, we have the titillating composite figure of Rayon, the transvestite with a heart of (Oscar) gold. Again, interesting that the filmmakers opted to replace all those real life gays with a star turn for an actor in a dress. ",2014
10,"I generally think McConoughey had become a bit too self absorbed. This movie, however, does validate my belief that he wants to do valid, absorbing film, whether comedic or serious. The storyline is - without spoiler - simply the early days of AIDS. The fears, the rumors, the medical community's stalwart continuation of using the victims as test subjects without real concern or commitment to resolution in many cases. Based on a true story, I recommend you watch the film for the period boldness, the two primary characters' acting, the sad part or directing which put a talented actress in a bad light. The person on whom the story is based is but one of us and we all have a story to tell. It's magnificent that someone read the Desiderata and determined to tell his story, which is worthy of your open minded, compassionate viewing. His daughter found it to be very real and her story about her father is worth looking up after you watch.",2014

9,"The movie is not quite about AIDS, the much it is about coldness and meaninglessness. I reached the multiplex some 10 minutes after the movie had begun, but the drift of story and the direction is too easy to grasp, and yet so abominable. Matthew is an electrician. The recklessness in his life has a reason he has learned to care for none as a gesture in return to his upbringing. By the end, he does talk about his memories of being a kid, of having a father of being taken care of. Then all those experiences which began as a thrill in the evenings and pretended as sense of freedom slyly and slowly had become addictions and only way to keep the brain from wondering what went wrong, why his life was the way it was. He became so mellow with being that insanely drunk guy in the blinding mist of cocaine and screams, moans of whores and random girls. Movie does not have any noticeable music I can imagine the horror of musicians though. He's not a bad guy at all it's just who he is—callous and kind of rejecting and condescending. But somehow this is how men seem to be normal where he lives. Then one day while trying to save a guy from being amputated at the rail-yard where he works, he gets shocked and passes out. He wakes up in a local hospital and blood-tests turn out to bear a news, a dead-end to his horror—they confirm that he is HIV positive. Was it whores, was it queers, was it recklessness? So, he's admitted and right next to his bed is this biological boy who feels like a girl—Jared. Matthew is homophobic not by heart but by trend. His homophobia is like their love for MTv top 40. But Jared is a very loving girl inside a guy's body. They play cards and Matthew(character's name Ron) loses. He is there after having tried to lose the sight of this HIV+ thing too in cocaine, liquor and whores. But he had to, for probably first time, accept that this one is different. A drug company comes up with a new drug AZT which is up for a test for 1 year and having done a lot of research on his part, Ron tries to get his hand on AZT by bribing a Mexican ward-boy. He was given only 30 days of life according to Doctors when first diagnosed positive for the virus. On 30th day, he goes to Mexico and gets those drugs which are legal everywhere else except in U(FDA just won't approve of 'em for some unspecified reasons which make it seem like a programmed fork of drug companies). He lives to see the 32st day. He keeps on getting those drugs and succeeds in convincing the custom department that it all is for his personal use. All along, he has to experience rejection from his friends who have begun to believe that probably Ron has been sleeping with homosexual guys(71% of international HIV + cases were associated with gay sex relations). It was shattering, but Ron had already grown up in Antarctica of human compassion—Dallas, Texas.",2014
8,"""Dallas Buyers Club"" is a fantastic film that defines the McConaissance as we have come to know it. Matthew McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, a homophobic Texan who contracts AIDS during the heart of the epidemic in the 1980s. Intrinsically, ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is not that monumental and exciting of a film. Where it excels most is its cast, which brilliantly brings the plot to life. Woodroof begins as a complete homophobe, reluctant to believe that he has AIDS since he ""ain't no faggot!"" He refuses to accept the consequences of the disease, choosing to continue his normal life. But unfortunately, this isn't possible. Forced to accept the potentially fatal effects of the disease, he begs to receive ADT, an experimental drug. However, after learning of the dangerous side effects, he goes looking for alternatives, finding experimental supplements south of the border. With these drugs, Woodroof outlasts his 30-day-to-live estimate, providing these drugs for AIDS patients in his Dallas Buyers Club until he is inevitably shut down by the FDA years later. To me, the film had several flaws, most notably the editing of its sequences. Since it spans several years, there are huge lapses between senses sometimes. While these sequences are mostly consecutive in the beginning of the film, there tends to be larger leaps throughout the end of the film. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, and I never really am when I feel the director has rushed me to the end of a film. This has been a huge issue this year with all of the Best Pictures this year besides ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Philomena,"" as many have either dragged on (i.e. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""American Hustle"") or been cut too short (""Gravity""). I think this editing tends to keep the length of the film at an appropriate 2 hours, without cutting out too many important details. However at the cost of maybe an additional 15 minutes, I still would have wished to see more of his trial against the FDA and more of his life's final moments. Now that the plot has been hammered out, it is time to get to the best part of the film: the acting.",2014

The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.",2013

1,This film is about four magicians brought together to perform the ultimate trick...to rob a bank (or so they would have you believe). I think that's as far as anyone really got with the plot apart from a few obvious twists along the way. Each of the four magicians is drafted in for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. ,2013
1,"I agree with the other negative reviews: good actors performing an incoherent script. The film is more of a collection of clichés than a story. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is how left-wing it is. We are supposed to cheer when Michael Caine's character gets screwed. The only reason I can see is because he is rich. Jesse Eisenberg on the other hand plays a smug guy you would like to smack upside the head. However, his heart is pure so it turns out good for him. Much of the story and the tricks are based upon screwing the ""one percent."" If you aren't a Wall Street occupier or are greater than 12 years old I recommend skipping it. Come to think of it, it's too violent for viewers 12 or less.",2013
2,"In all fairness, I had been warned. A movie review show said this was less than impressive and the write-ups in print were ""luke-warm"" but when the missus said lets go watch a movie, I wanted to give it a try because the cast was impressive and come on, who doesn't like magic tricks???? Let's begin with the positives. It runs for 115 minutes which compared to The Long Ranger and anything Peter Jackson hands in is almost preview length so that was good. Unless the result of decent editing is a lack of character depth then perhaps it wasn't.... but we'll get to that shortly.",2013

4,"I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here, many of them ""claim"" that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However, this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast, some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering ""That's dumb,"" ""That doesn't make sense."" They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.",2013

The preamble is good: a group of mentalists and illusionists gets picked up by a mysterious third party who turns them into a team and turns them into a Las Vegas sensation while a secret plan unfolds underneath. But that's where everything stops making sense. From then on it's a series of car chases with the police, magic shows in prominent theatres around the world while a man tapes the illusionists to try and unmask their tricks. But why he does it is never clear and never will be until the cheesy, predictable finale. Besides the spectacular special effects and camera movements, there's nothing here. And two incredible actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are completely wasted in roles that hardly make sense in an already disconnected storyline.",2013

How established stars like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (who usually appear in good films) were persuaded to take part in this rubbish is beyond me (although Ben Kingsley was recently in a worse one, so they are not the only offenders). I don't mind suspending disbelief when watching a science fiction or comic book based film, but not when watching one which tries to pretend to even a bit of reality.

Production quality and big names disguise the fact that you're watching a F of a movie at best. Gets a 1 because 0 isn't available. This movie's character development is atrocious. Its rushed and doesn't identify with its audience since the characters are put in a setting that's completely ludicrous. Its a paint-by-numbers script.

The cinematography and use of color in ""Her"" is really beautiful. The acting is uniformly good. Particularly Amy Adams, who plays an understated role as a nerdy girl next door who may have feelings for Theodore; despite a relatively quiet part, she completely inhabits Amy, making her feel like an actual person. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job (as usual) with Theodore, and Scarlett Johanson makes you believe she really is a computer with a heart. But I wanted to highlight Adams's performance; especially alongside her much larger role in American Hustle, she deserves a few big wins this year.",2013

Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year.

9,"I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her. ",2013

His character is so boring, so lifeless, so inane you just want to scream at the screen. I actually did. Several times. Meanwhile, his OS is being unfaithful. When he finally figures it out, he is so weak that he can't bring himself to call up Microsoft or Apple and get another operating system. One that is actually useful. Heck, even Linux would be an improvement at this point. At the end I was hoping that he would hurl himself off the top of the building, taking his pathetic neighbor with him. Curses - foiled again.

9,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.",2013
10,"I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year. Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the writing. It could've easily been a clichéd look at technology or the future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with his OS; on the surface, they may seem like ""just letters"" or ""just a computer"", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires.",2013

I will say that the cinematography is quite well done but not stimulating enough to help with the story of the film (or lack there-of).",2014
1,"Big fail. A dystopia is where the author takes what we value today and projects it into the future... as a nightmare. That is, what we ""like"" becomes a nightmare. Spike Jonze wants something like that, but fails, since he probably doesn't know what dystopia is. Like many feminists, male and female (think Margaret Atwood), Jonze thinks he can take what he *hates* about his culture into the future and project that; that's neither utopia nor dystopia, it's just a rant.

OK, so the cinematography and soundtrack etc. are totally unoffensive, but in my opinion, it is grossly over-acted, including the OT's childish whining. (""Oh-ka-aaaaay."") Their conversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid for homework and the delivery of it all is just so.... fake.

James Wan's 'The Conjuring' is one of those rare gems in the horror industry that finds a spot beside the classic titles of horror, 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' due to James Wan's ability to balance an atmospheric dreadful tale involving wonderfully crafted characters with a haunted house that had my palms sweating and my heart pounding during some of the most horrifying moments (There are a few of those; make sure you empty your bladder BEFORE entering the theater).",2013

Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmega hold their own as the Perron's and EVERY SINGLE child actor owned the screen.

At this point, that fact doesn't quite matter, especially when this is mostly designed as a horror movie. And as a horror movie, its job is to offer real terror and take any ghostly elements seriously. The film isn't actually trying to give newer scares. This is old school stuff, but good old school horror movie stuff. This is the kind that gets to do more than pull off another jump scare trick. Another benefit the movie got is its director, James Wan, who delivers a crafty storytelling. The Conjuring is not terribly innovative, but I don't think it needed to. It's the execution that keeps everything so gripping, and I think we needed that in this suffering era of the genre.",2013
9,"This latest movie from Saw director James Wan goes down a fairly traditional haunted house film route. In it, a regular family move into a new home and are immediately terrorised by a malevolent ghost; a married couple who specialise in dealing with paranormal activity are called in to help exorcise the evil spirit. It was seemingly based on a true story. From the above synopsis you could be forgiven for thinking that this is a re-tread of the likes of The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist. And I suppose in many ways you would be correct as the influence of these types of films is pretty evident. But that would only be half the story because The Conjuring is a film that definitely stands up on its own right and for my money is one of the very best horror films of the last few years. The chief reason for this is simply that at times it is very scary indeed. It's not a graphic horror film at all; it relies on the fear of the unknown and the unseen. It combines lots of the things that make traditional ghost stories so sinister – an old house, a hidden room, a witch, tragic histories, possession, creepy old children's toys and, of course, well-placed jump scares. This movie has all of these elements and uses them well. It doesn't necessarily bring a lot of new things to the genre but what it does do is expertly arrange several traditional ideas into a very satisfying whole.",2013

If something isn't scary to someone – someone who earnestly believes that of course – then a fright flick has failed at its core intent. Then we have something like James Wan's The Conjuring, an artful, confident throwback that succeeds in maintaining a high tensile level of pressure on our senses, crafting vital jump scares, a potent human element and all encompassing technical prowess. This is the type of brave, but stripped down horror filmmaking that forces you to analyze other elements besides just the full effectiveness of its frightening intent. Plus it's scary as hell.

1,"A horrible, hideously cliché exorcism movie. The ""true story"" based plot could not save this movie from B actors and eye-roll-inducing jump scares. It was great comedy, however. It starts off with a typical, all-smiles Caucasian family. They move into a new, demon-possessed mansion. In fact, let's have a bonus round of sorts, with how much it resembled Dark Skies.* *Birds crashing against the house, girl knocking her head against an object, little kid seeing their own personal ghosts. And the cellar, don't get me started on the stereotypical ""dark, creepy"" cellar. I think this movie was marketed toward teens who are easily scared.

Considering the artistic mastery of Antichrist and Melancholia, it shocks me that Nymphomaniac comes off as nothing more than a sloppy, messy attempt at turning nymphomania into some sort of deep philosophical head trip.",2016

1,"Regarding all the critics and expectations for a topic presented like that, I would just say that this could not keep me interested for more than 10 minutes on the movie. The first music itself (rammstein) at least tries to gain your attention, makes me remember some psychological movie, which would at least makes you feel disgusted (like Srpski Film) or disoriented (like Irreversible), and make you think a little bit on the point of having watched it, to gain a certain sensibility, or a different perception on a specific case.",2015
1,"OK, I admit it, you had me at ""Nymphomaniac""...but honestly, the swelling of certain extremities normally associated with the anticipation such a title would evoke, left immediately when I heard LeBeuf speak.The accent he used wasn't even questioned by the director? Did the director actually watch any scenes on playback? Are we to believe that a nymphomaniac believes themselves to be worthless humans? Now, I tried to reserve judgement until I had watched both...a considerable task when one isn't even interested after the ""end"" of the first trainwreck. I will keep my opinion about the ""artistry"" to myself. This movie had potential and obviously budget to make a strong impression, but all it did was come off as predictable and a bit antagonist toward conventional morality...maybe that was the point, but again, no comment on the artistic content. It was poorly executed and excruciatingly drawn out. The end was almost a relief...even mildly amusing. Both main characters displayed canned hypocrisy throughout and I would guess that to be another part of the ""art"" content....once again, no comment. Don't waste your time. Sex is fun and simulated sex isn't...especially when the simulation paints sex to be so.....well, no comment.",2015
1,"CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH VOLUME I AND II: I give a 1 to this film to balance if possible the high rating it got in this site. The film was rather pretentious and was at a certain degree a classic example of emptiness trying to present itself as ""high art"". The parallels of nymphomania with fishing in the first half of the film and with Christianity later where pointless and just to make impressions in my opinion, even insulting or blasphemous in some points i could say. Another thing i found strange was the extreme use of ""deep"" and ""wise"" references to mathematical, scientific and philosophical concepts. But it all seemed rather forced, messy, and meaningless. It also failed in my opinion to get deep in the human psyche and explore effectively or at least expose the spherical/ holistic nature of the phenomenon of nymphomania. It was quite single sided and narrow minded as i see it. As for the people that claim it was a deep psychological journey, sorry von Trier fans, but the impression this film gave me is that he is a person with poor and shallow insight on the human being not to say prejudiced. In the end i didn't feel being left with some serious food for thought, intriguing questions or spiritually benefited and more self-aware or with self doubt and criticism. I also had the impression that the film was quite naive in some psychological aspects and delivered a rather childish, unrealistic or idealistic view of the human psyche and reality (yes despite all the cruelty and misery depicted it still gave me that impression). Especially at the depiction of the first years of her life and her maturity to adulthood. The showing of nudity as some said and the sex scenes, where not that extreme and had a reason to be there in some moments, but in others i agree that they where there just for the shake of being, no help to the plot or anything. The exploration of the human perversions and fetishes was rather forced too, like the bdsm chapter, gave me the impression that it was there so that the director could state ""look! we have put bdsm too in it"" and didn't necessarily deliver the desperate odyssey and degeneration of a tortured soul in a realistically climaxing way. It is also important to mention that this was a humourless movie whatsoever. Every attempt of ""humour"" was rather too dark, trolling, unintelligent, immature or just provoking. Even the born to be wild song in the train scene. Or the casting of Shia Labeouf, if this had a humorous intention in the first place of course. So no mature and original humour. The acting was a bit sloppy too i think, i especially didn't like much the acting of the old Joe (who is the protagonist for god's shake)at a major part of the film but wasn't impressed by young Joe's either. Another weak point was the excessive use of tiring narration, exposition, a sign of weak writing that cannot deliver it's messages subtly and with ease but rather immoderately throws them at the viewer's face. One of the few things i liked in the film was how we got little secret messages and warnings from the beginning about the final scene, where the old man would try to take advantage of her. Honestly i expected that from the beginning. Some will say that it was another drawback of the film cause it was predictable, linear, unintelligent etc bit i think it was delivered in a nice and well thought way. One of the few well thought things of the film. The answers he gave to her shocking stories, how he always tried to justify her actions but came a bit needy, his body language and acting, even some verbal slip-ups. All came to draw the picture of a perverted, repressed old geezer that was ready to explode any moment now. Even he stated he read everything literature has to give on sex, showing his obsession but impotence to make his urges real. If it was just an asexual philosopher he would have read some things just to have an opinion on love but wouldn't have obsessively and explicitly exhaust all the relevant literature. I liked the depiction of the oppressed man, it was more effective than the nymphomaniac's unfortunately. I liked the antithesis of the two main protagonists. The insatiable one that fully gave in in her passion and the ""ascetic monk type"" that fully repressed it for a life. The one ended up repenting and the other dying for letting his passion feed inside him for all these years. They weren't so different in that sense that's why they came to all these distorted conclusions about love and life, each one by his perspective. Even that ""catchy"" phrase on love was talking about sinful destructive passion of egoism than love, but they never lived true love so they couldn't have a valid opinion on it. There where also practical mistakes in the film like plot holes, logical inconsistencies, unnatural time loops etc. but i don't want to waste time on these, let other commenters exploit these. For example she went to medical school and did a gyno exam in the beginning? how? was she on her medical specialty? no. she was just a sophomore where they just open corpses and such, they don't do gyno exams. (except if things are different in england and i'm mistaken). The p girl chapter near the end i found it rather bizarre, unrealistic, not making much sense and just being there to make more shocking impressions or hopelessly try to save something that seemed doomed already. So in conclusion four hours are far too much for a film that has no much to offer you (i include volume 2 too). But if you are so curious arm yourselves with patience and watch it.",2014

Also it was a bad movie because it is not interesting at all.I found it boring with monotonous dialogue between Joe and Seligman who are the main characters.The movie offers sex and some porno,but never satisfies movie viewers.We don't know why a nymphomaniac woman is a sex slave who practices sex and masturbation for pleasure only and we see the opposite that she becomes addicted to sex and nudity and seems clearly in this movie she is not enjoying sex.To me Lars Von Trier should really convince us to see a movie and must work hard to make a good plot and not just provide us with porno to make us horny.",2014

Then the main character says her first sexual encounter was comprised of three thrusts through her vagina and five through the back door, and the old man that is listening to her says ""Ah, Fibonacci numbers!"" Hell, I am a physicist and I deal with math everyday, and when I hear the numbers 3 and 5 strung together I don't think about a far-fetched Fibonacci sequence, but prime numbers instead.

1,"Tolkien's works mean a great deal to me. I spent my childhood reading and rereading The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and whatever else I could get my hands on published posthumously. The Hobbit is a gentle story. Bilbo, with some help from Gandalf and the Dwarfs, is able to accomplish amazing things, despite his small size, because of his luck, wits, and strength of character. The other characteristic of the book is the vastness, diversity, and beauty of the world, filling one with curiosity for what is just around the corner, but also taking just enough time to linger a while in every place.",2014
7,"I won't ""review"" the content of the movie in any detail, but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist (in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema: I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing!) It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated, garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize, before going in, that this is not simply ""the movie of the book"". This is Jackson's The Hobbit, not Tolkien's, and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media, come from different centuries, and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow; Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it, in tone and scope.",2013
4,I saw the movie in 2D because I hated the 3D HFR in the first Hobbit movie. I thought the HFR just made the movie sets look like sets instead of being part of the movie universe.

Regrettably there were too many things that were wrong with the movie for me to achieve that. ,2013
1,"This movie is so far from the story found in the book that Peter Jackson wouldn't have needed to get the rights from the Tolkien estate. I disagree with many of the naysayers who think this shouldn't have been turned into a three part series. There is plenty of story, action, and character development in the book to make three reasonable length films. The issue with how Jackson has handled this ""adaptation"" is that they have truncated most of the important elements to the original story simply so they could make up drawn out action scenes for the sake of action.",2013
2,"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is more of a bad Steven Seagal clone than an adaptation of well-read literature. The first film in the new trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, was very good, with one problem I'll mention later. If the worst decision Director Peter Jackson made was to include Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly, which seems to be the case for the professional praise-givers, this film would be fantastic. However, it just so happens that there's this little thing Jackson and his fellow writers forgot to do: make sure the movie resembles the book.",2013

1,"If you were thinking about seeing The Desolation of Smaug, do yourself a favor and stay home. It's close to 3 hours of your life you will never get back. The plot has almost nothing to do with the book. There are completely fabricated characters and there is NO character development. In fact, I had to go stand in the hall for a minute because my brother & I were laughing so hard about the fact that the third movie could be 3 hours of the cast members literally destroying copies of The Hobbit and it would probably be a better movie than this. The last 30 minutes are completely made up, insulting to Tolkein, and painful to watch. I would actually pay more than I paid to see the movie to get those 3 hours of my life back. I am at a loss for words at how Peter Jackson did so well with the Lord of The Rings movies and then seemingly had a seizure while holding a pen and decided to call it a script and go with it. I think they thought that bringing back Legolas would help the movie, but in fact they only detracted by going ahead & writing him as a bland character who is now, instead of being primarily an archer, a ninja swordsman of some sort. They also opt to attempt to squeeze in a love story instead of actual events that happened in the book, because dull romance sells. If you love the book as much as I do and have any sort of positive expectations for this film, you will be severely let down.",2013

How can one make such a bad movie... i don't even know what to say but everything is wrong with this movie, visual effects, direction and story. If you have read the book you will be disappointed.

The dragon was cool though but that is all i can say i liked about the movie. Two hobbit movies would have been enough to tell the story from the book, i mean just look at the harry potter movies compared to the books, they are just brilliant.

But, it claims to be ""The Hobbit"", and not ""Peter Jackson's Wacky Tales from Middle Earth"" so I looked at it against the true Tolkien story.

When the scene is finally at an end we are served with some forgettable dialog where the company discusses the danger they are in, accompanied by some dramatic background music. It's a sign of things to come.

What I did go in expecting was a good performance by great actors and I must say the acting was fantastic, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a complete train wreck. I felt it had potential at first and then that feeling quickly dissipated after watching the first beating commence and continued to diminish after seeing the attempted hanging where he walked around on his toes for at least a good twenty to thirty seconds and we had to sit and watch. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get more boring but then they threw in yet another thirty second scene where we all proceeded to stare at the main character's face while he sat idle, occasionally moving his head from side to side. I wanted to feel emotion for these poor characters but every emotion that I had was quickly ruined by incredibly long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes. Not only did I have to sit through the agonizing, stretched out scenes but whenever there was about to be a significant lapse of time within the main character's life they'd add in a bonus five to seven seconds where we stared at a bunch of trees. I'd like to say that I was moved by the movie or felt some sort of enjoyment in watching it but in truth the only touching moment I truly had was at the end of the film when I realized it was FINALLY over.

When slaves were supposed to be digging a paddock they were just tapping hoes on the ground. When slaves were cotton picking they were just playing with the cotton. All the slaves were over weight, and wore clean un-tatty clothes. Quite often the actors looked as though they were uncomfortable doing what they were doing. Those prolonged whipping scenes did not feel real. When he was left hanging, this again did not seem to be at all real. Someone wriggling a bit on the end of a rope. Where was the suspense and drama? Instead an overly long scene. Boring! It could have been a great film. But for me, it did not work at all. It would have been good to hear the story after he was released from slavery.

Clearly it's central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer. This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to understand it.",2013
1,Solomon Northup suffered many degradations after being unlawfully forced into slavery in the American Deep South during the 1840s and 50s. He contributed to a ghost written book detailing his tragic experiences. This movie is based on that book.,2014
1,"Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come.

2,Why Do We Watch Movies?,2014
1,"Before I started reading reviews on IMDb I actually thought the cinema was a form of entertainment. Now I realise I was totally wrong. A silly comedy like ""Meet the Fockers"" or"" Legally Blonde"" is condemned as a complete waste of time.""I want my life back"" But a film lasting two and a half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slavery,beaten half to death and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars. If I had gone to the cinema alone I would have left after 15 minutes.What sort of people can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two and a half hours.The only thing that kept me awake was the hope that the slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats.No such luck.The slave was rescued.A weak ending to to a weak pointless film.",2014
1,I'm really going to be the exception here and pan this film. I was no non-plussed about it that I can barely be bothered to review it properly. The amount of dead space (for example a 75 second scene showing Soloman just looking at the scenery) was astonishing - any other director would have dealt with the subject matter in about 30 minutes. Both my girlfriend and I were close to walking out with the boredom.,2014
9,"Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.",2013
9,"If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.",2014
2,12 Years a Slave — a biopic about a black fiddler in NY who somehow wound up a slave in Louisiana from 1841 until the law rescued him in 1853—is the nearly universally acclaimed front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. Yet it's built upon a fourth-rate screenplay that might have embarrassed Horatio Alger.,2013
9,"Directed by Steve McQueen and staring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict CUmberbatch, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, and a ton of other stars, '12 Years a Slave' is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a freeman who was living in Saratoga, NY before being tricked, drugged, and sold into slavery in the south.",2013
1,"Sadly, the show started out with incredible potential but fails critical plausibility and logic requirements over and over. From unmonitored prison visits to overuse of flashbacks to convenient disciples popping up everywhere to violations of every basic police and military tactical procedure, this show has jumped the shark in the first season. Constant capture-escape-capture-escape is already dull. And even though the show was inspired by 24, it didn't even learn the basic lessons from that. ",2013
1,"Like many here, I was intrigued by episode 1... and thought that a great new show was here. By about show 3, I had filled my quota of suspended disbelief, and could not longer enjoy it... I was just slogging through a painful experience, long enough to see what would happen next.",2013
3,"I tried and really WANTED to like this show. Kevin Bacon is a fantastic actor. The premise of the show seemed really great, the first episode was good and engaging but by episode 3 it unfortunately all fell apart. First and most of all the storyline is just waaaay too far fetched and unconvincing. Many characters seem just plain stupid (Jordy - if he is such a devoted follower WHY on Earth would he speak and give away important info to the FBI right before killing himself in the hospital bed?!? This might make sense if he was seeking redemption but he wasn't at all. Just because they promised him he would see his God/Leader again?! You gotta be kidding me... and this is unfortunately just one of many completely idiotic points in the whole story so far), zero depth, no believable background AT ALL. Some action sequences - even though they are not crucial in this sort of show - are so ridiculous the whole thing becomes just a painful experience to sit through. With many other shows on TV this will be quickly forgotten and frankly - that is exactly what it deserves. 3 stars go to whoever convinced KB to be on this in the first place, haha!",2013
2,"This show is absolutely terrible. For me gore isn't really an issue, but this time it was. I loved the movie Dredd despite it's horrible violence and gore, because it didn't shove it in my face. This show can't get away from it because it's the only thing it really has to keep people interested. But showing a tortured and brutalized dog that's barely alive and suffering or playing a tortured girl's cries for help while having her eyes ripped out is too far. That's trash writing right there. There are plenty of ways to evoke the emotions of fear and sympathy without crossing that line, but when you need to cross that line just to try and stand out you know you're standing alone and deserve it.",2013
1,"I tried, lord I tried. But the umpteenth time the law enforcement professionals did something so stupid it got themselves killed, while the serial killer geek cultists did everything to perfection and/or dropped out of the blue to effect another miraculous escape, well, it was just too much. Nobody was expecting reality, but the body count of prison guards, cops, sheriffs, FBI agents, SWAT operators, US Marshals etc is now in the dozens!",2013
1,"This show is truly insulting. After the first 40 minutes the writers ran out of any plausible ideas so it's ridiculous situation after situation. Joe, it appears has magical powers that can make anything he wants happen at any time. From a jail cell, he creates a network of followers that he has never talked to with unlimited funds and resources.",2013
1,"This must be the most annoyingly irritating TV series I have ever watched. I find myself getting really annoyed with the ridiculous incompetence of the entire FBI and police departments, while the aggravatingly smug serial killer reigns supreme. You just find yourself wanting to really slap the characters and tell them to get on with it. For one thing, this guy would be so locked down in jail that he would have no contact with his followers at all, and surely the best way of stopping the entire thing is to execute him. Isn't he on death row anyway. The worse thing for me, is that there is no perceived resolution. If the situation is resolved, then the series is over. This means that you just know that it will go on forever. There is just no satisfaction in this.",2013
2,"I'll start by saying that the show had some good action to it, the actors are well developed and the overall theme to the show is great.Aside from that the show seriously lacks in the general intelligence and intuition of those playing law informant characters. The F.B.I. are after a cult following a brilliant serial killer who is currently behind bars, the members of the cult are supposedly rather intelligent themselves and yet the F.B.I. and the police never seem to be prepared for the twists, never sending enough officers to do a job. Of course if the police were depicted as being intelligent and competent individuals, the producers would have had to hire actual writers to keep the series moving.",2013
1,The first two episodes were very good but then it was all downhill from there. ,2013
1,"I really tried to like this series. James Purefoy is excellent as the brilliant psycho , and Kevin Bacon is not bad at all. ",2013
1,"I watched six episodes. I really tried. The first showed potential, despite plot and plausibility issues. Each episode strained credibility further. It's like the writer just could not see the story's descent into total farce. Characters so implausibly stupid, police and swat incapable of decisive action, and saving characters introduced from nowhere under incredible circumstances. I genuinely feel sorry for the cast. The story is just so bad this writer should never be allowed to work again. Tonight I took it off my DVR. I doubt there will be a season 2, which is a shame for the actors. Sorry guys, it just got too ridiculous and far fetched. The writer killed it.",2013
3,Really never take the time to write reviews but I felt I needed to say something about this show.,2013
3,"When The Following kicked off it had the most gripping start that i've seen in a TV show in years. The cast, the setting, the plot... everything looked very promising. The references of Manson family, Waco siege, as well as serial killers would satisfy even the connoisseurs, with Ted Bundy even being quoted. Unfortunately, this didn't last long and the plot turned out to be the main problem.",2013
2,"I wanted to like this series; I really did. I've always enjoyed Kevin Bacon's work, but this time it's impossible. With regard to Episode 5, I noted that he folks who wrote it are simply not in touch with reality.",2013
10,"Upon reading many of the User Reviews for ""The Following"", I have noticed that the people who bash it have no idea what they are talking about, with all due respect. Most of their ""arguments"" fall into 3 categories: 1.) The F.B.I/Police are incompetent. 2.) Joe Carroll/The Cult has ridiculous resources and influence. 3.) The convenience of the plot.",2014
1,"When I first saw the plugs for The Following back in the Fall I thought it held some promise. So my wife and I watched. And watched. And watched. And, wow, is it awful. Monday night we turned to each other halfway through the latest snoozer and agreed we were saying ""No More!"" to The Following.",2013
7,"Okay so I am reading all these reviews about how bad the plot/story line is, I for one don't understand all the bad reviews???? It's a weekly TV show its not some grand movie that is suppose to have a start and finish its a weekly TV show that's suppose to continue on and on and if you think about cults like Waco and militias like Ruby Ridge well Law enforcement isn't always the most competent and these cult leaders do set up camp right under our noses so its just not that far fetched, look how long Bundy killed before getting caught, but this is from someone who liked Criminal Minds I tend to like shows that get into the criminal psyche. Kevin Bacon is superb and James Purefoy looks like he is having a great time playing this charismatic psychopathy. Lighten up watch this for the entertainment that is a weekly TV show its not meant to be the next great movie of the century that's what Captain Phillips, American Hustle or 12 years a slave is for.",2014
7,"At this writing, The Following is rated 7.7, but most of the reviews are very negative. How can that be? Personally, I find many of the criticisms of this show undeserved.",2014
9,"The writing was good creating tension and setting the scene for following episodes. The play between Kevin Bacon's character as the flawed former FBI agent and James Purefoy as the serial killer is excellent. Purefoy's character is both frightening and compelling fleshing out a complex character that plays well against Kevin Bacon's powerful portrayal as the former FBI agent. Good first start. Similar to the FBI character in The Red Dragon, Bacon is struggling to come to terms with his experience with the killer. The supporting characters are also very good and there are enough twists and turns to satisfy most of those who like thrillers. The one flaw is that in a one hours time limit the end became a bit predictable. However, this is forgivable because of the quality of the writing. It leaves enough hanging to compel me to watch the next episode.",2013
1,"Let's see.....the phantom who only gets caught when he wants to and can cut down armed police and prison guards who are trained to handle the extremely violent, like wheat. The monster with a personal and alarming relationship with his captor. A monster who unlike the very plain and uninteresting real life serial killers we know of, is a tenured and inspiring college professor. The physically and/or mentally handicapped crusader who is re-called because he is the only person in an entire population of professional criminal hunters who can re-capture the monster.......flashbacks......oh, Jesus god......flashbacks......are clearly the story telling technique most beloved of Satan. And lest we forget the re-kidnapped sole survivor/witness, of course, who may or may not survive, who in this version, does not survive because of course, as we all know, the police can never protect anyone. The younger prickly, irritated associate investigator, the accommodating and deferring young acolyte investigator who wants to learn........and on and on and on. The only person missing so far is the surly senior officer who constantly scolds our hero but wait, this is only the first episode. The most satisfying part of the show oddly was the flashback of the original shooting and presumed capture of the maniac. The second best was the gratuitous breaking of the maniac's fingers by our hero although the maniac didn't seem bothered by that as much as I would have liked. I am a big proponent of the breaking of maniac fingers by the way. ",2013
10,"This new television show is well written and brilliantly acted. I am thrilled to see something on the air that actually promotes thought. Unlike reality TV, this show has twists and turns that will catch the viewer totally by surprise. As a former literature major, I loved reading Edgar Allen Poe. This show will surely bring back an interest in his works. So kudos to the writers for actually being intelligent and my hope is that viewers will be challenged and continue to tune in. I know that I have had my share of mindless television and look forward to seeing another episode of ""The Following"" next Monday night. I guess you could say that I am a ""Following"" follower. Now, how about setting up a Facebook page so we can Share, Share, Share...? *smile*",2013
8,"After watching the series premiere of ""The Following"", it left me with an impression that I simply couldn't find anywhere else as the story unfolded in such a terrifying way. Although some may complain that it moves by a little too fast(which I admit at times it did), that's only a small qualm as the performances and main plot make up for it with various twists and turns throughout the story. Kevin Bacon was simply incredible as the worn down FBI agent with a tragic past that has yet to be explored further as the show progresses, but James Purefoy is MARVELOUS as the twisted serial killer. With his manic stare and smile, you're not really sure as to his true motives. This makes him more dimensional yet at the same time diabolically and devilishly sinister; playing mind games with the protagonist with his schemes of mass murder and mayhem. Purefoy is a beast of a man that no one wants to mess with.",2013

There is of course Akira and Ninja scroll and stuff like that people in general should watch at least once in their life. The only Anime TV show that I watched from the beginning was Fist of the North Star. A real classic in my opinion.",2013
10,"I've seen all kinds of animes, mostly adult ones because usually they have a better story then kid shows, and I had nothing left to watch so i googled 2013 animes and this one seemed slightly interesting, watched a trailer first and didn't like the trailer, watched the 1st episode and I was hooked, watched the 2nd and i was totally hooked, watched the 3rd and it blew my mind, now I will have to wait every week for an episode daaamn, the first 3 episodes of this anime prove that this anime will be an awesome one, you can foretell that by watching how the first episodes is building up this hype-level of an awesome story which started out sad and is going to become epic and bloody. The concept is unique and I like it. Humans who live inside 50 meters high walls to protect themselves from titans (giants), Eren the main character feels unpleasant about it compared to everybody else because that's not really true freedom for a human to be ""livestock"" inside walls, waiting to get eaten by titans. One day, and that would be the day they would all remember for eternity, the day when first wall fell and hell broke loose, this is where the story starts. And it just gets better and better! There's a lot of emotional and bloody scenes which usually makes up for a good story. You know those animes that catch your eyes on the first episode, this is one of them.",2013
10,This anime just keeps me on the edge of my seat. Each week I watch and each week I want more. It's intense. The concept and story line are on point and keep you thrilled and wanting more. The only downside is the seven-day waiting for the next episode. Definitely one of the best anime I have seen. ,2013
10,"This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them.",2013

10,"Only 6 episodes in while writing this review, but wow what a start. Firstly the music and voice acting are seriously good, and the art/animation is top notch, very nice indeed. Then regarding the story line - right from the off we get deep into the scenario, the characters, and their fear. The anime does an amazing job of portraying the characters emotions, you really get the sense of how much of a helpless position the humans are in. Quite a lot has happened already in these first 6 episodes, with already some shocks and unexpected events. Really has been an incredible start to this anime, and that is what I have rated it on, though I have extremely high confidence this one will be one that gets better and better.",2013
10,"Animation - absolutely incredible, fluid, not blocky, crazy camera angles, and very good character designs and animated facial expressions.",2013
9,"This is fantastic on many levels, the story, art, and atmosphere. The basic premise of mindless giants that eat people sounds ho hum on paper but watching it gives a much different feeling. As an audience we don't know a whole lot more than the characters so the emotional impact of twists and turns mirrors the character development. And believe me, there are twists and turns you probably won't expect. No one is safe in this world and it is a brutal world. The requisite young pair of kids is there as the focal point for the series and there are other typical anime trappings I've noticed, based on my limited exposure to the genre, but you will immediately forget about those if they bother you because the story is so darn riveting. Violent. Bloody without being gratuitous in the gore department, the horror comes from unpredictability and the feeling we are seeing what it is like to be ants in a human world. Highly recommended for adults. Don't dare expose this to sensitive children, it will absolutely freak them out in a bad way. As far as I can tell this series also is staying very close to the Manga. This is one of those series that people don't mind paying a streaming subscription just to get. However, you can watch for free if you get Crunchy Roll.",2013
10,"I have to give this anime a 10 our of 10! Ever since the first 2 episodes, which was in my opinion one of the best hook-on I have seen, it was very intense and conveyed fear to the viewers very well. Some people complain that it has gotten slow or was boring in some episodes, but I don't think they fully grasp how important each episode is. First I think ever since the first 2 episodes, it made people raise their standards and expected more and more action every time. The show does an amazing job on building character and storytelling in general. I doesn't have to have action all the time just for it to be good. This anime is top-notch! The money and time they invested in this Manga adaption was well done! Excellent! Animation is beautiful! Whatever the effect they use for the Tian's animation is also nice. My next obsession is the soundtracks! I am so glad Hiroyuki Sawano helped worked on it. He is a highly valued music composer that is remarkable at making one of the most epic soundtracks, such as Gundam UC: Unicorn. The Manga's content was a lot more gory, but they adapted it and censored it in a way that did not ruin the story. Voice over is also excellent! Expresses feelings and other emotions strongly and effectively.",2013

The plot, the characters, the animation, the soundtrack...are all top notch. Special mention for the first opening: epic is the word for it. Try and watch the first 5 episodes and you won't be disappointed.",2017
9,"from the best series i ever watched.An incredible story that you can""t imagine and it will keep your brain follow them until the last movement and you will be shocked at the end and to wait for the second part and the enthusiasm in the episodes gets us restless for watching it.Although it's fantastic since you can't foresee what will happen and that's why you have to watched it.It's a series that you can't skip like Death note and the insistence will let you watched it in one day or two maximum.I hope you will enjoy the movie and i can not stand for the second season and i wish you will give him this attention and to have a big priority although it very hard to think about any events that will happen.So it's an exciting action and exciting series.

10,"Okay, if you want to see a series of the utmost strangeness this is it. A town or village is wrapped up like a cocoon behind a fifty meter wall made of strong cement and concrete. Outside of these walls are individuals who walk around naked one quarter of the height of these walls. What ever they are, they look humanoid, but with an appetite for human flesh. For the past 100 years, the walls have kept the village safe until one fateful day the secretive Titans as they are called appeared to break down the wall so that the walking demons could have their fill. And these titans are higher than the wall itself. Now a boy named Eren, vowed revenge against them for having his mother eaten by one of the demons in front of him while on the run with his friend Mikasa and Hanne. This horrible dream for which the people themselves feared had come true, a reality that not all walls can hold back an enemy no matter the size. Even water drops over a hundred years can break a wall. Now outside of the walls, Eren must become part of the military with very limited weapons to help their cause. But more often than not, the soldiers themselves cannot find out where or when these titans arrived to cause so much despair and terror. This series is not for the feint of heart, it contains a good amount of gore as well as horror scenes which will curl your hair. I have to say this is one for the books, I have seen all sorts of horror but this series looks very, very interesting. I would have to say anyone over eighteen can watch it. Under that age will give kids nightmares. One of the most original series to date. Highly recommended to those who like this genre.",2013

This anime managed to revive this dead art of anime that has been publishing rotten immature sexualized garbage for 7-8 years or so, and these trolls that probably didn't even watch it keep down-voting it because they call older animes better, wth... What are you even trying to do, keep anime in the horrid state it was before this piece came out? After seeing the votes breakdown, I even suspect some multi-accounter repeatdly voting 1's on it (very low average from the US only, coming from a high percentage of 1's...) and an incredibly high percentage of 1's from the 'top 1000 voters'!

5,This show had great potential but bad writing eventually brings it down. ,2014
3,"It's pretty bad. At first I just didn't like it but after more episodes I realized it is objectively bad. Almost all the characters are unlikable. The scenes are mostly static, framing almost non-existent, storyline jumbled and out of sequence. Instead of Attack on Titan it should be called ""Talking on Titan"", as it's scene after scene of dialog the sum of which is as original as an 80's sitcom. And the dialog is extremely repetitive. So many characters have similar spoken voices, identical delivery and presentation, similar faces, similar character traits, it's a big bowl of bland mush. Oh and the whining and crying is almost nonstop. Basically this is a show about emotional teenagers expressing their self doubts, self loathing, jealousies, fears, and grief; over and over and over and over and over in nearly static images. There is very little action, maybe 1-2 minutes in each episode.",2015
9,"Attack on Titan is not your everyday anime. People die in this show and the good guys are always at a disadvantage. There are no superpowers or magic stuff. It's an all out brutal war about tiny humans versus the Titans, huge humanoid and seemingly brainless creatures.",2013

I have read the manga for about two years and it is one of the best reads I've ever had. This is not your regular shounen, happy-go lucky, good guy going out kicking bad guys asses. This series is BRUTAL. It will keep you thrilled, sometimes flat out scared and entertained for the entire ride.",2013

It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn't boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn't ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style! ",2015

He's previously rebuilt his body after being held captive by Middle eastern extremists, in the process created a metal, enemy pulverizing suit, equipped with flying jets and energy blasters of course, defeated his crazy competitor, a vengeful, bird loving Russian, and now an alien race. Bottom line: the man's had his fair share of ass-kicking. This understandably, is beginning to effect him. He's having anxiety attacks and the fact that a supposed terrorist labeled the Mandarin is targeting civilians, and maybe even some friends of Mr. Stark, isn't helping. Sure enough as the story progresses, his pals, president, prodigy, love, and life are on the line. With out giving away many of the films twists and turns, Tony ends up somewhat back where he started and must find the tools to save his fate before time runs out and you know the story. Or do you...? ",2014

8,"To date this is the best Iron man movie without any doubt in my mind. I rarely give movies a rating of 8 and above and I nearly gave this movie a 9. The problem with this movie isn't so much the story or the characters as they all perform beautifully. Tony Stark is as always very well portrayed, Pepper and Warmachine all spot on. The acting is superb and not to be questioned. The visual effects are spot on, the editing however... and here begin the problems. ",2014
8,"The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of ""The Avengers"" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.",2013
8,"i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.",2014
8,"Since 'Iron Man 2' proved to be less than stellar back in 2010, this third adventure for the Marvel hero returns with a much-needed boost of attitude and character. 'Iron Man 3′, which can be also considered a sequel to ''The Avengers', takes us through many twists and turns and tons of new Iron Man suits. Director Shane Black tosses away some of the wham-bam action to focus on the quick-witted humor and our hero's internal struggle with crippling panic attacks. I have no doubt that this will be a fan favorite of the franchise and will light up the box office something fierce.",2015
10,"After watching the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers, I thought that Iron Man 3 would be just more of the same with lots of action and not a lot of story. Man, was I wrong. Not only is this movie the best out of the Iron Man trilogy but it's also one of the best MCU movies period. From it's witting and humor to it's darker story and how it delves into the character of Tony Stark, Iron Man 3 is a truly phenomenal comic book movie.",2015
9,"So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.",2015
8,How do i put this? Nothings been the same same since newyork. Just saw Iron man 3. and what do i say? Freakinglegendary.. A MARVEL-ous start of the Phase 2.. RDJ you were...you.. as always..we know who you are! Even if you take away all the tricks and toys and all the money and the suits. YOu can fix this. You are the 'Mechanic' !,2015
10,I enjoyed the first Iron Man film and the Avengers. The second one was alright. This one is just excellent.,2014
9,"I thought that Iron Man 3 was a smash hit! The movie shows that Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. is truly a superhero, and shows that he does a lot more heroic qualities of Tony Stark. The previous Iron Man films were shown by the perspective stand point of Iron Man, but in this film shows a lot more of Tony Stark. ",2013
8,The film is really good its has plenty of action adventure and humour. The budget was $200 million and the Box office was over billion which shows the success of the film.,2013
9,"Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, ""things are different now, and I'm a different man"". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.",2013
8,Warning: spoiler alerts:,2014
7,"After being totally thrilled by The Avengers, I didn't expect exactly the same amount of greatness in ""Iron Man 3"", yet I still needed a solid story to keep me interested. There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.",2014
8,"""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of ""the Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife ""Pepper Potts"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and ""President Ellis"" (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see ""The Avengers"" or possibly one of the other two ""Iron Man"" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can. In any case, I believe this sequel was a notch above the preceding ""Iron Man"" movies and I have rated it accordingly.",2013
8,I've read a couple of the reviews of this film and been disappointed. Whats not to like here? Its Ironman back for another movie and that means a lot more fun.,2013
9,"its not as same as the previous ones. But a must watch. The movie is well directed, well poised. This movie deals more with the human emotions and the separation from real love because of the involvement of machines in the life of a human. Movie tags along well and well keep it to your seats till the very end. I have not given it a 10/10 because the plot could have been a slightly better. But, nevertheless the movie is awesome, and a must watch. a complete family thriller. ACTING - 10/10 DIRECTION - 10/10 PLOT - 8/10 CLIMAX - 8.5/10 ACTION - 10/10 THRILL - 9/10 CINEMATOGRAPHY - 9/10 VFX - 10/10 . OVERALL - 9/10. :) . ENJOY IT! MUST WATCH!",2013
8,"The director of this film called: "" Iron Man 3 "" is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****",2013
8,"****This Review may contain spoilers**** Iron man 3, a good film from the point of view of a non-marvel viewer like myself. No doubt it was wildly successful, and personally I found it funny, action packed, had a sense of girl power delivered nicely from Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) towards the end, and was just a thoroughly enjoyable film. Although from the point of an avid marvel fan it was a true disappointment, stripping The Mandarin (Ben Kinglsey) of his original evil ways and making him and idiotic and useless tool that is part of a bigger plan; not only that but they got an actor as highly talented as Ben Kinglsey and wasted him on a role with little meaning. However I did really enjoy the comedy The Mandarin brought which complimented Killian Aldrich's (Guy Pearce) evil and malevolent ways. Moving on to the most important person; Tony Stark – played by the one and only amazing Robert Downey Jr. He is hilarious and has brought back another astounding performance from the original Iron Man. While everyone else delivers a great performance, Robert Downey Jr really makes the film how good it is! However it was quite annoying that in the film Iron Man, he spent a little amount of time actually in the suit being Iron Man and more time being Tony Stark. While this is good, I'd still prefer to have seen more of him in the suit, being IRON MAN! This is only a minor bad point and didn't have too much of an effect on the overall film. Like I said it was funny and action packed and just really good to watch. It had impeccable editing and exceptional special effects, plus the Eiffel 65 theme tune was so great! Going back to the view of a Marvel fan, the film was an utter disaster. If you go into this film and expect to see an accurate representation of what was delivered in Stan Lees famous comic books then you will be greatly disappointed. 'The Mandarin' is reduced to nothing more than a druggy who was found on the streets and brought in to act the role; the only good thing is he was played by Ben Kingsley. While it did add an element of humour I still feel it was a bit of a let down from what was expected. Also with him being made into a joke it stripped the film of its main villain and left an empty hole which could only be filled by a true evil source. The whole plot of the film was good, well thought out and followed on nicely from the two previous films – which were also amazing – and continued the whole theme of the trilogy perfectly. Also it was well connected to The Avengers which was good but unless you'd seen The Avengers, like I hadn't the first time I saw this film, then it got a little confusing and felt like I missed something in the second film. This was just a minor setback and was quickly fixed with a little background info from a friend. Finally I felt this film was extremely good, a little confusing but nothing too bad, very funny and I enjoyed it all the way through. From my point of view, a non-marvel fan, it was a great film; but from a serious marvel fan it was a serious let down. I'd recommend that if you want to see an action packed and really good superhero film then this is for you. But if you expect to see an accurate and close follow to the comic books then this isn't really for you. One last note is the final battle, this was seriously amazing! The special effects in it, the amount of money spent on it just everything! The pyrotechnics were something else and just I loved it all so much! One of the best scenes from a film ever.",2013
9,"I think it was in ""Last Action Hero"" that the kid sidekick told Arnold Schwarzeneggar's movie character that by the third movie, everything is supposed to get harder, and that's very much obvious in ""Iron Man 3"" because Robert Downey Jr.'s character of Tony Stark spends more time out of his suit than he did in it in both the first two movies. Once more dipping into the franchise of Marvel Comics, a terrorist named the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley is threatening the world, and it is again up to Tony to stand up to defending the planet, only he is not going to be helped by his teammates from ""The Avengers."" Tony is assisted by Don Cheadle as War Machine aka Iron Patriot and the rest of his iron brigade that by this movie he has developed to operate by voice control. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts actually gets more to do than just scream and be a victim; she actually gets to wear the suit and become the Iron Princess. The movie and plot are rungs above the first two films with a lot more going on. Experiencing a bit of post-traumatic stress after the aliens in ""Avengers,"" Tony proves he doesn't need the suit as he deals with a number of genetically enhanced assassins led by Guy Pearce who can actually burn through the suit via a genetic quirk that amped his healing factor. (Does Wolverine know this chowder-head stole his gimmick?) Watching the movie, I can't help but wonder if Tony has ever seen a zombie flick; why doesn't he just shoot these people in the head? There is no way they can regenerate brain cells. Once those things are lost, there is no coming back. Beyond that, ""Iron Man 3"" is beyond exemplary, setting new standards for all superhero flicks coming up or in production and establishing that it really doesn't matter who's in the suit, just what you do with it. There are a few more deaths than usual, and several jaw-dropping moments, and Downey's quips and the fact the movie itself doesn't take itself serious make it more than appealing. My only fault with it is that Tony was going to come to Tennessee, he could have stopped by and said hello. My advice: leave the genetically enhanced assassins in California.",2013
8,"It's weird, the movie starts without the opening credits. Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.",2013
9,Iron man is one of my favorite heroes from Marvel universe. This means that here you might read not entirely objective opinion and I'm sorry for that.,2013
8,"This is, as another reviewer quite rightly said: ""utter tosh"". Well of course it is. It is delightful, fluffy, nonsensical utter tosh and I say Thankyou for that. TV is missing more of this sort of silliness. It is so very easy to watch. If you blink you miss nothing but if you watch it without blinking, it is easy on the eyes/heart/soul. Sunday afternoon by the fire with a hot chocolate cupped in hand...THAT is what this programme is and I for one think they should be applauded for providing this 'niche service' for those of us who like a small slice of comfy 'utter tosh' in our otherwise frantic chaotic troublesome lives.",2013
3,"This series is rather like the recent Marple remakes: Nice attention to period details as far as clothes and cars. Yet, as with the Agatha Christie novels made within the last few years which have been moved into the same period, the episodes are not very much like the books. (At least it does say in the opening credit that they are based ""on characters by G.K. Chesterton"";certainly not on Chesterton's--or Father Brown's--theology and period background, and only very loosely on the plots.)",2013
5,"I was sad I couldn't enjoy season 5 as much as previous ones. I don't know if Detective Mallory's performance is supposed to be acted so poorly or if Jack Deam is a lousy actor. He seems to be channeling a parody of a pirate, what with his screwed up eyes and mouth and sneering.",2017
8,"I've been gorging on UK TV (can't believe what I've missed) testing out this mystery series and that and discovered that I LIKE A lot but my preference after watching different styles, is the lighter, quirky, fun series like Father Brown. Lots of charming characters, gorgeous scenery and a lovely village. BBC is the BOMB!",2015
4,"As long as you don't think about the Father Brown of the G.K.Chesterton books, this is not a bad series. Entertaining enough and Mark Williams is a nice enough priest. It only has the name Father Brown in common with the Chesterton books and as long as you do realize that and preferably never read any of them you should be all right. It's a shame the plots are as shallow as most of the Midsomer Murders ones because the Chesterton stories have some very good plots and they could have been used. I'll still watch them as they're nice and short and often fit a gap between other programmes. Mark Williams is a good actor and very entertaining.",2013
5,"Why call this Father Brown when it bears little resemblance to G.K.Chesterton's stories? If anything it is a Cotswold version of the US series Father Dowling crossed with Midsomer Murders. Some of the plots are sub-Marple tosh. For example in ""The Mysteries of the Rosary"" Father Brown locates a rosary that has been missing for 500 years with ridiculous ease, then leaves it in his church and is astonished to find that the criminal Flambeau has stolen it. Father Brown was not so naive. Of course many of Chesterton's plots hardly bear close examination but they have a certain inventiveness that this series totally lacks. Also missing are the paradoxes that are such an enjoyable part of the stories, for example in this extract from The Secret Garden: Simon shook his fists in a frenzy of French logic. ""A man gets out of a garden, or he doesn't,"" he cried. ""Not always,"" said Father Brown. On its own terms it is tolerably entertaining, and the music is very well done.",2014
6,"We have watched Father Brown from the beginning and really enjoyed it at first. We thought that Inspector Sullivan would evolve a bit and he seemed to, then they got rid of him! They replaced him with Inspector Mallory who is a total buffoon. Yes a comic character but even those characters have some movement. I love, love Hercule Poirot because he is friends with Japp and other agents of the law respect him, know him and treat him with deference. No matter how many times Father Brown solves the mystery for the police, it is the same thing over and over again: Mallory bungling, arresting an innocent,barring Father Brown who is forced to sneak around with his cohorts and always solving the mystery. Even the police in Marple asked her aid and tipped the hat to her now and then... So, if Father Brown should continue, please, please use some common sense, heave ho with the 'tosh' and at least have him working with an inspector with some brains under his hat. On another note, Jack Deam came from DCI Banks and he was excellent so he must be hard up for cash. This is beneath his abilities.",2017
9,"I saw Alec Guinness play Father Brown in the film version some years ago and an enjoyable film it was as well, shame he did not make more Father Brown films.",2013
9,"I really enjoyed watching this BBC adaptation of GK Chestertons, Father Brown stories. It was really perfect viewing for a winters afternoon. Having read all the stories I realise that some people will not be happy with the way this adaptation has been made. In particular Mark Williams as Father Brown was far from the physical image Chesterton created in the stories. I for one don't think this matters as Williams gives an excellent performance in my opinion. The setting is perfect postcard England. There is a few plot holes in the episodes if you compare them to the stories, but I hope this series will attract more people to read the stories. As a lover of the English crime drama I for one hope that they make another series, there is still plenty of stories to adapt after all.",2013
10,I really enjoyed all the series. Each one seems to get better. There was plenty of morality and drama in the latest crop. A nice dose of comedy too. Perfect bad weather viewing or for insomniac nights. GK Chesteron was reputed to be not a lover of those of the Mosaic persuasion so watching the programmes was even more of a guilty pleasure. Contrary to the animadversions of your other reviewers I found Mark Williams to be more than suited for the role and his housekeeper reminded me of Janet from Dr Finlay's casebook. Forty five minutes was just the right length for each episode and of course being the BBC the lack of commercial breaks is always a plus. If the series encourages viewers to go away and read the stories then it has fulfilled its mission.,2014
8,"An enjoyable television series, more or less remotely inspired from G. K. Chesterton's character(s). To be relished as such, independent of any other literary or cinematographic influences. But also as a pretext to go back to the earlier versions, from the '50s and '70s, respectively. The first movie is in black-and-white, with a vintage 1950s atmosphere, while the 1970s series is the more faithful to the original, in spite of its rather more low-budget air. The new version is quite flamboyant, and yet it might ruffle quite a few feathers of the viewers who are expecting to get more of the original Chesterton stories. A successful entertainment for the more modern-minded nostalgic(s)...",2013
9,"It is wonderful to see Father Brown move into its fifth series, the show is quite wonderful, it's such easy viewing, it's funny, of course it's intriguing, it's just a great family show. Of course I love the heavy and complex mystery dramas on virtually every week, but there are times when you just want to sit back and watch a cosy, safe murder mystery. Forty five minutes of engaging, entertaining mystery, a genre which had seemed almost dead. Mark Williams has managed to inject something into the character of Father Brown, his performances are superb, he's a joy to watch, as are all of the cast. There have been a few duff episodes, but for every bad one there's a quality one, the likes of The Owl of Minerva and The Bride of Christ, they are great viewing. It comes as no surprise to me that the show is a big international success, I love it.",2017
5,"Disappointing on several levels. Change of era is one, though it is true it would cost more to costume, etc. for the era when the Chesterton stories were written, rather than the 1950's; though the stories here don't rely much on the Chesterton originals. Even with that too much of the dialogue comes across as post 1970's not the 1950's.",2014
3,"While the plots are indeed terrible, and the characters cliché, I do NOT think this series is ""delightfully silly"" for one thing its not delightful. But also its NOT fluff. The reason they are badly written mysteries is because they are not really mysteries. I think the writers are simply putting more effort into making them morality lessons. Instead of fun mysteries we keep on getting boring lectures about how women are just as good at sports as men, people of color are always innocent, foreigners are all virtuous, and English people, especially nobility or wealthy or religious are always the bad guys. Not only is it irritating, but it makes it very easy to know who the murderer is. The show always starts with the marginalized group being wrongly accused. ",2017
1,"First of all Father brown isn't a detective and isn't a sleuth, he is closer to a psychological profiler. He puts his head into the head of the person who performed the dreadful deed, he is not interested in whether the culprit is caught or not, but really only if his soul is saved. Who knows how many murders he 'let go', but on the whole I would think that he manages to get them to turn themselves in, after all he manages to redeem Flambeau, no easy task.",2013
3,"The last time Father Brown shuffled into our screens was in 1974, with Kenneth More, in 13 episodes. Then it lacked the sophistication of, let say, Joan Hickson's Miss Marple or Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes a decade later, especially in the field of atmosphere and art direction.",2013
5,"When I first read few years ago that they are going to do a remake of G.K. Chesterton's classic Father Brown, I was simply ecstatic. As Father Brown has always been one of my favourites. After watching the first episode, I could barely believe the mess that they have created. Just about everything is wrong in this production. First, what could be a valid excuse to move the story from it's original 1930's setting to the 1950's? There really isn't one! I understand that they have wanted to create something new, but for the love of all good, WHY? It's as out of place as a fish riding a bicycle. And speaking of fish, there has rarely been as badly miscast series as this one in the history of British television. As good actor as Mark Williams is, he is quite possibly the worst choice to play Father Brown, as he isn't old enough, heavy enough nor does the character he plays, have any of those charming qualities that make Father Brown so memorable from the books. And I really don't think anyone could have given more useless performance as he does in this series. Anyone who has read Chesterton's novels, knows pretty good what Father Brown should look like. This is NOT it. The acting is just that bad throughout the series. And it gets worse... On top of everything else the writing is nothing short of stunningly bad. What were these people thinking? And finally, when they have chosen to play this in the fifties, chose the worst actor in the British isles, got the bad scripts.. they had to choose as a set decorator, someone who doesn't clearly understand that ""fifties"" means 1950's - not 60's and 70's - as you see A LOT of stuff from both in the series, including cars, watches, furniture etc. It just doesn't work. I'll give it a 5 stars, just for having the guts to even attempt something as bad as this is.",2016
8,"Well, ""Detective"" is possibly the wrong word. ""Sleuth"" is possibly a better term.",2013
10,I saw an episode on PBS a few days ago and now I'm hooked. I've already watched almost all of them online. ,2015
5,"They picked the wrong actor for the lead here. Mark Williams is nice enough, but doesn't convince at all as a priest. Shouldn't there be a touch of slightly whimsical other-worldliness about Father Brown? If so, it's missing here. Also, when he gives his little religious homilies, he comes over as a bit of a prig, which shouldn't be the case. On a minor note, he doesn't pronounce church Latin right either.",2013
1,I did not read the Father Brown books so went into this show with no expectations except that it was a British murder detective show.,2017
6,We absolutely LOVED Father Brown for the first 4 seasons.,2017
5,I haven't read Chesterton's books and I accept that many reviewers have indicated that the link with the author is very tenuous and its probably only made for legal reasons. My review is based on interest in period TV detective stories.,2017
9,"I love an afternoon after lunch watching Father Brown, it is complete and utter nonsense granted, but it's very easy to watch, sometimes amusing and sometimes rather engaging. Mark Williams is wonderfully cast in the lead, he is such a naturally funny man, he knows when to be serious and when to inject a touch of humour, it's very rarely overplayed. Sorcha Cusack is excellent as Mrs McCarthy, so often a gossip and prickly in nature, and yet somehow she makes her likable. Always well acted, favourite guest performance has been John Light's Flambeau, he always adds something to an episode. ",2015
9,"Set in the 1950's picturesque fictional Cotswold village of Kembleford this series encompasses the gardens of ""Rosemary & Thyme"", the quaint village settings of ""Grantchester"", the clue dropping slower pace of ""Death in Paradise"", and the ridiculously high murder rate of ""Midsomer Murders"".",2017
3,"The plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take over universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright but there was very little action in this mindless action film. What little fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.",2013
2,Let me start by saying that I don't hate superhero films. I like them very much when they are done well. I hate laziness in films and superficiality. The problem is that pretty much every superhero film made is very lazy and most of them are entirely superficial. Marvel's initial idea of an Avengers universe was inspired from a marketing stand point but I am beginning to question whether or not it has been a failure from a creative stand point. 'Thor the Dark World' is a terrible movie. It does absolutely nothing to add to the mythos of the character or this Marvel universe. The only reason it exists is to draw up excitement for the next Avengers film. ,2013
2,"Go ahead and find this review not useful. But listen to me. I love Marvel films. The Original Spider-man Trilogy was amazing and The Avengers was awesome. But when I saw Iron Man 3 I was bored out of my mind and I felt it was not good. So I lowered my expectations for this movie and hoped it would be better right? Because from what I learned, the lower the expectations, the better the movie. Big Mistake.",2013
4,"Thor: The Dark World left me wondering why for all its popularity and box office hype the superhero genre so regularly fails to ignite the faintest trace of excitement and imagination in its narrative and storytelling. This sequel, following Kenneth Branagh's reasonably funny 2011 film, was written by no less than five writers, who between them have only mustered another dull, achingly generic story about saving the world. Aside from less than a handful of funny self-referencing points, this is a hugely disappointing by the numbers blockbuster that under services its embarrassingly rich cast and offers its enormous fanbase too little that is challenging, inspired or even surprising. ",2013
4,"I guess it may be the fact that I never actually got into comic books (beyond Asterix and Tintin that is) that this movie didn't really appeal to me. I guess in another way that I did not find that mixing the gods of the Norse pantheon with the world of superheroes really worked all that well. To me it just seemed to be wrong. Okay, I understand that Thor is the member of the Avengers, and the comic series that bears his name is quite popular, but to me parts of this film did not seem to work. In fact I found it quite boring.",2013
2,"Let me start off by saying I had fairly high expectations for this film, not only being a fan of the first film but of Thor as a comic book characters. To be nice, these expectations were not met. To be realistic, this is easily the worst of the Marvel movies. This is my first review so sorry if I jump around a lot with what I say. Let's begin with the characters. Thor was.. okay. He said nor did anything noteworthy really. He didn't grow that much as a character, and simply felt boring. Natalie Portman was horribly boring to watch, and in some scenes her character was written as an idiot. That seems to be a common problem with the movie. Jane Foster? An idiot. Eric Selvig, an originally intelligent character that had some serious, good talks with Thor? Running around naked because the Tesseract made him go insane... or something. It wasn't very clear. Speaking of, if he went insane because of the Tesseract, why was Hawkeye completely okay after a bonk on the head? Darcy? The most annoying girl on the planet. She was meant for comedy but came of as GRATING to listen to and watch. Odin was a douche who didn't know how to rule properly. Malekith was just... boring. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. In this movie his motivations are unclear and his only character trait was he likes to frown at things with his puffy looking face. Character wise the only saving graces were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, which did not matter much considering how little they were in the movie. Which is strange because Loki is in the trailer so much, but has MAYBE 20 minutes of screen time. The special effects in this movie were just ugly. Every monster looked fake and many of the scenes looked like they were pulled out of a last gen video game. the set design was okay, but not once did I feel immersed. Everything felt like a flimsy set. It was just an ugly movie to look at. The plot was just all over the place, with cuts to different scenes happening frequently. Many scenes were completely useless could have been cut altogether. Literally the only good scene was when Loki and Thor trick Malekith. Also, considering it was never explained how Loki was able to survive a stab wound, switch places with a guard, then switch places with Odin becoming the new leader of Asgard, the ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The dialogue was just... horrendous. There were multiple points where myself and the people I've seen the movie with just laughed at the ridiculousness of what was being said. Speaking of, the movie was farrrrrr too funny. Don't get me wrong, I like comedic relief in these Marvel movies, it works for the established universe but GOD they literally play every scene for comedy it seems. Even the final world ending battle with Malekith was played for comedy. For Christ's sake, THOR RODE TO THE BATTLE IN A SUBWAY CAR. There's a gag where him and Malekith are sliding on the side of a building with office people looking outside blankly, completely meant for comedy.. IN THE FINAL, WORLD ENDING BATTLE. Avengers, Thor, Iron Man 1,2 Captain America, all these movies had the common sense to put the comedy in scenes where it was necessary. Hell, even Iron Man 3, the most comedic movie behind this one had the common sense to say ""This is the final battle. Let's make this badass"". Another problem with the final battle itself is that it has no 'WOW' moments. There's no real climax, everything is just bleh. OH and Malekith is squished by his spaceship. That's something. Oh and why the hell do Asgardians and Dark Elves have so many technological based things?! They have star ships, turrets, laser cannons, ray guns, etc. There's nothing here that feels like magic, which is what Thor should be about. And the Aether. The main point of the movie. The weapon to spread darkness throughout the universe essentially ushering an era of rule under Malekith. I couldn't tell you a damn thing about this thing other that it spread... darkness. whatever that means. The concepts that this movie is trying to give are incredibly under explained. Where did the Aether come from? Not explained. How did Jane end up actually finding it? Not sure. What's the Convergence? It's when the 9 realms line up so Malekith can... spread... darkness?.. How powerful is it? I have no idea. Apparently universe shattering, but Thor doesn't have much trouble fighting an Aether powered Malekith. It's actually kind of sad how easily he was dispatched. There is little fun to be had in this movie. It's just stupid. I didn't care about a single character besides Loki, who was actually somewhat developed and easily stole the show when he was on screen. This movie is absolute garbage and has ruined Thor cinematically for me. I truly hope Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy are good or I truly worry for the Avenegers 2.

1,I am not sure where to begin....,2013
5,"This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made, because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to the superhero genre, they had the mentality of ""if it works previously, why fix it?"" direction. It's like one of those video games that does well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.",2013
3,"Following on from the events of the Avengers movie, Thor is back in Asgard, delivering Loki, who is damned to spend an eternity in the Asgardian dungeons.",2013
2,"Well they got the ""dark"" part right. Does it distress anyone at all that somewhere deep in the bowels of Hollywood there are people who make many times what you make for coming up with the idea that watching a lot of banging and clanging in an alternate universe that -- at its best -- resembles Central Park at midnight is .... entertainment? If it does not, it should. The problem with sequels like this -- aside from the fact that they are actually produced in the first place -- is that they serve no useful purpose other than making the original in the franchise look better than it was. I promise you, IN THE NAME OF ODIN AND ALL THE 9 WORLDS, that half way through this exercise in controlled depression, you will long for Thor 1. (With its really clever opening -- essentially the story of a Boy and his Hammer, having been separated therefrom, and finally reunited). Tom Hiddleston steals all his scenes, in some places he is more interesting huddled in a corner reading a book than all the CGI flashbangs and associated pyrotechnics combined. Sir Anthony -- a man seemingly untroubled by how poorly this phase of his career pales in comparison to his prior work -- is lost behind his eyepatch and almost unrecognizable. Portman has never had better H&M (hair and makeup) and in the chatgroups there are fanboys prattling on about watching this with the sound off. A final factoid: In the 60s, in the days when Marvel was only comics, Thor was never top gun, it was the artwork (flaming yellow hair) and the pleasant predictability of the stories and the arcane language that carried the brand. So far, Marvel has yet to really translate this into film.",2013
1,"This movie is from the schoolgirls by the schoolgirls for the schoolgirls and, when I say schoolgirls I mean really juvenile schoolgirls, immature at best. This is an exercise in cheer-leading. This movie is for those that believe the moon is made of cheese, candies grow on trees and in running streams of chocolate milk. Not that there's anything wrong with it but I thought the premise was the damnation of the universe.",2014
6,"Personally I am more of a DC fan than Marvel, but it seems like everyone has been pressuring me to watch the second installment of the Thor movies, and...it was disappointing.",2013
2,"I like the first Thor but honestly this one was so boring and predictable that I left the movie theatre tired and incredibly bored. It starts off with a huge battle and that is great. I like battles but it is between the Asgard and the Dark Elves. The dark elves get beaten and thought of as dead. And for some reason Asgard, protector of the nine realms does not really confirm this, they just assume. So an entire millennium passes. Then Natalie Portman is in London. Just like that, for some reason she is in England and then for some reason, just like that in a warehouse is an inter dimensional gate to a dark cave that holds some crazy slimy looking evil ghost like thing, that naturally possesses her sort of. She is still herself but if some touch her they are thrown across the room, while if others touch her they are fine.",2013
5,"There's nothing more disappointing than a sequel that does not live up to the original film it came from, therefore, my cinematic experiences over the years dealing with such efforts have certainly been tragic. ",2013
3,"The first THOR was a hard sell A demigod with long blond hair and an ancient hammer isn't your typical brooding comic book hero And so the earthlings, including Natalie Portman's Jane, a beautifully brainy love interest and her colleagues, including sarcastic hipster chick Darcy, who, using a snarky monotone, second-guesses the bizarre situation, helped make the audience believe this was all really happening",2013
4,"Thor: The Dark World was truly a dark disaster. Although many critics disliked Thor for lack of plot, the Thor sequel fell entirely short of its predecessor.",2013
1,"We very seldom walk out of a movie, but to us our time is worth more than the cost of any movies. This move was bland one dimensional, and with no character that you could care for. The girl that was suppose to be Portmans assistance was utterly pointless and annoying. To top this there was an assistant to her, this man was even dumber than her. I think it has become an sport to make male characters with no spine and brain in Hollywood movies, it makes the feminist happy. Back to the movie, 30 minutes through we were literally falling sleep, so looked at each other and just left. There is no plot that can have anything remotely to do with any possible laws of physics, anything goes. No characters to relate to, and special effects well, there are explosions that is all. Don't waste your time.",2014
4,I watched the movie yesterday in the evening and honestly I did not enjoy it at all. Firstly we were shown 50 minutes ( yes 50 minutes!) of advertisement. I can proudly say I know all the kid's toys now.,2013
5,"This film was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high for Thor 2. I was really hoping it would improve on the first one (which was good but had so much more potential.) I saw some good reviews for this one and some bad ones, so I tried not to have my expectations up TOO high whenever I saw it on my own. ",2013
4,"I'm going to be blunt, mainly because it's 5 am and I'm finally done watching this underwhelming movie.",2014
5,"The first Thor was probably one of Marvel's more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the ""real"" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.",2013
5,"There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.",2013
3,"Gotta say, digital eye candy can be pretty astonishing. Wish I could look at the worlds they created all day. Screensaver maybe?",2014
7,"While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.",2013
1,"First I will say this. Guillermo Del Toro is one of my top 5 movie directors. I own Blade 2, Hellboy 1 and 2, Pans Labyrinth, The orphanage and so on. I was really looking forward to this movie for over a year and was wishing it would deliver but all it did was fail. EPICALLY. The score I gave were for visuals. Whoever says this movie is great they are the reason movies keep getting made. I left the movie theater angry. This has to be the worst movie written and edited of all time. How would anyone release this $200 million dollar cluster fudge.",2013
7,"Unlike some, I had no problem with the high concept of the piece: Transformers vs Godzilla. It had a lot of potential. And when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less so. Too much time spent on ""Top Gun"" like fighter pilot shenanigans. Not enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't required to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special either. Sort of universally ""meh"". Good for a Blu Ray rental.",2013
7,7.2 out of 10 by now with one fifth million users it is a predictable rate for this movie.,2013
2,"""Pacific Rim"" is going to be a hit with fanboys all over the planet. It's the type of movie that they feel obligated to love because of what it's about and who made it. In this case we have a movie about alien dinosaurs (Kaijus) fighting giant robots (Jaegers) directed by Guillermo del Toro (filmmaker who most Comi-Con attendees think can do no wrong). Sounds like it should work on every level doesn't it? Yeah, well it doesn't!",2013
1,"If you are not in a coma or if you are over the age of 8 don't go see this movie. It is terrible. On the other hand, if you are under the age of 8 I think you will like it! In short, this is a movie for kids, not for adults.",2013
7,"To all the reviewers who gave this movie low ratings, I can only say this; What did you expect to see? Did you watch this expecting to see something deep and meaningful? The trailers and posters make it perfectly clear what kind of movie this is going to be. Heavy CGI, regular Hollywood 'save the planet' storyline re-run. Young eye candy super hot actors. You know the score. If you want to see something clever, this is not it and it was never going to be.",2013
7,"Guillermo Del Toro's epic homage to the Japanese 'Kaiĵu' movies, produced on a bigger budget than all such giant monster movies of the last fifty years combined. Del Toro obviously has a great love and respect for the genre, resulting in a very catchy action flick, undoubtedly the best American counterpart to its Japanese predecessors. One might almost say Hollywood has redeemed itself for the 1998 version of Godzilla, but such a statement had better be held back for another year, until the next American reboot of Godzilla hits theatres in 2014. In the meantime, Pacific Rim works well as an appetizer to the big G's resurrection. An extra-dimensional rift opens on the bottom of the Pacific and huge beasts come pouring out, wreaking havoc on mankind as they lay waste to cities and obliterate our armed forces. Humanity quickly sets aside its internal differences and joins forces in creating big robots to fight the creatures on their own terms. Piloted by a pair of human Avatars, these so-called 'Jaëgers' effectively combat the beasts, but the life of a Jaëger pilot as Del Toro reveals is filled with personal loss. When the monsters emerge ever more rapidly from the Breach, as it is named, Jaëger command develops an intricate and dangerous plan to halt the Kaiĵu threat once and for all. Del Toro briefly explores the history of the first Kaiĵu assaults and the development of their robotic antagonists and afterwards spends more time getting us invested in the human characters than is usual for this type of film. It does make the movie feel like its dragging its feet for a while, until he unleashes the action the audience craves with a vengeance, resulting in over an hour of nigh endless monster bashing. Unfortunately he cannot help but inserting a few characters that are supposed to deliver some much needed comic relief to make sure we don't take it all too seriously, but sadly these characters – stereotypical geeky scientists as ever we've seen them – are so mind-boggingly annoying (Charlie Day particularly) they make you wish for a Kaiĵu to step on them to end their endless whining. Del Toro's talents are better suited in delving deeper into a world where Kaiĵus are not only a threat to world peace but also big business: toy companies produce action figures of them, creepy cults worship them and in Hong Kong, a 'Bone Town' is established, a black market for Kaiĵu products for shady purposes, similar to the disgusting existing South-East Asian trade in animal parts. Run by Ron Perlman (always a joy when paired with Del Toro), some of the funniest, wittiest and anatomically most unsettling scenes take place here. Though the dealings and the history of the Jaëgers are fleshed out to the fullest, their enormous alien adversaries, ever the most important ingredient in a Kaiĵu film, do remain somewhat underexposed by comparison. Unfortunately their motivations – they're really foot soldiers out to cause as much damage to mankind as possible, in order to pave the way for an invasion from their (smaller) intelligent overlords – remind us of the recent Shyamalan flop After Earth, a movie we'd rather forget entirely. Usually, Kaiĵu are more antiheroes than full-out villains, but Del Toro opts to keep them a simple threat to be wiped out instead of imbuing them with a more sympathetic character like their forebears Gojira, Gorgo and Rodan, who were always the victim of human (nuclear) folly, transforming them into avenging gods to remind us of our place in the world. The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda, two people who only too well understood the need to layer their creatures and make them charm you so you feel more for them, but in this instance, Del Toro decided not to go with such wisdom. As a result, Pacific Rim at best is a highly likable action flick, but not necessarily an apt lesson for western audiences into the true nature of the Kaiĵu genre. Then again, there's only so much you can do with the notion of giant robots bashing giant monsters. Let's say Guillermo gets as much out of that premise as we could hope for.",2013
1,I went into the theater expecting to see a cartoon for adults and that is exactly what I paid for.,2013
1,This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Sure it has crazy creatures battling it out in the oceans which is just fine with me but so many elements just let the movie down. It could have been so much more.,2013
1,"I'm not sure how i finished this movie. But i did, and i want my life time back. I had fun in the first 10 minutes or so, but after that just downhill.",2014
8,"We all carry a great sense of wonder. It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.",2013
7,"I didn't dislike this movie; giant robots against giant monsters is a fun idea that isn't like anything else being done right now. But the dialog needed to be smarter. I think there is more going on with the characters than I picked up from one viewing--I gotta believe Del Toro put in some layers you have to dig for. But on the surface, it comes off like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80's. Some notes for the sequel: 1. Hire a writer that speaks the language the film gets made in; 2. Get someone in there that understands color design--maybe you could sell some toys if everything wasn't all the same shade of blue-gray; 3. Don't bother having the giant robots throw the giant monsters when they're fighting in water. It doesn't hurt. Show more damage. It's cool when body parts break off. Kthnx, j.g.",2013
7,Before watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really hammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then again I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many would agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it did have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the worst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences were very engaging partly because the film established what was at stake before them.,2013
7,This film starts of with a monologue that explains in twenty seconds how big monsters start appearing from the sea and destroying everything. The only defence against them is to kick their heads in with massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I expected this to be a fast paced action movie.,2013
8,"Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.",2013
10,"For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got the DVD now and I escape that way. Channel your inner six year old, lean back and enjoy.",2013
7,A movie that could have been great if not for the obvious flaws that drag it down. Let me break it down by sections:,2013
1,"Pacific Rim is an exercise in unoriginality. By the end, I desperately hoped that the filmmakers had intended some cynical meta-theme about the poor state of Hollywood films today, but I gave up hope upon reading the pretentious boasts by Del Toro and his cronies who apparently took this boring popcorn flick dead seriously.",2014
8,"I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)",2013
7,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. When I first heard about machines fighting giant monsters I figured it would be ridiculous and it was. Luckily, it was a good kind of ridiculous. Being a fan of movies like Godzilla and an avid anime watcher helped me to pull together the various components of this film. I would have enjoyed it if they had put more time into explaining the development of the machines more. It felt like they rushed through that portion.If I had one main criticism, it would be that the cheesiness level was very high. Other than that and the occasional bad acting it was fun watching the high definition fight scenes and pretty cast.",2013
7,"As an avid movie fan, this film had one of the best visual effects on the big screen I've seen in a while. Although I knew most of the technology did not exist, it looked so realistic. I'm in no way a professional, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seemed to me that the visual fx department did wonders with the context and they were top notch (applauds).",2013
7,"Entertainment is not just a story. It is not just drama or social commentary. It is not something that can be measured by terms like ""latest and greatest"" or ""cutting edge"". This movie is not Man of Steel or Star Trek into Darkness where there is a child-like obsession with being ""taken seriously"" by adding grotesque violence or depressing overtones. This is not Transformers 3 or the Hobbit where special effects and action scenes are a cluttered mess of ADD rave parties that try to up the excitement with jumpy editing. THIS IS A SINCERE MOVIE.",2013
10,"For almost two years since I first heard whisper of Pacific Rim, I've been excited on a level I don't recall being excited about since I first heard about Independence Day.

8,Every once in a while a show comes along that catches you completely off guard; you only want to check out the pilot because you've read a comment or two on IMDb comparing it to some other show you kinda like – and BOOM: you're blown away. That's what happened to me with 'Banshee'.,2014
10,"Banshee has recently started its third season, yet if you search for online reviews of the show from the major entertainment sites, you'll find almost none. Which is a crying shame, because for any one who loves good action shows, Banshee is a must watch. There's a reason, despite being on a premium channel not many people watch, that Banshee has lasted this long. And that reason is sheer awesome badassery. ",2015
10,"IMDb needs a review, this show is excellent. ",2014
10,"When I first found this show on demand I was already excited. Yet after watching it I was beyond satisfied. Every episode had me at the edge of my seat wondering if it could actually get any better, and it just kept getting better. By the end of every episode I was left in my chair speechless from the shock. I wanted more, and I think I will need more for a very long time, I decided this is going to be one of my favorite shows so long as it airs. I don't think I will ever get enough of this series. The acting is great, the story is epic. The action scenes are perfectly executed. Everything just goes together so well. I don't want to write any spoilers, I just want you to support this show with me, because I want to see season after season, and I don't want it to stop if it keeps up this. This is a good thing that we have been given, and the more we watch it, the more hope it has to be given another season.",2013
10,"I don't agree with some of the negative reviews. After watching the pilot I didn't know what to think of the show. After looking for some shows to watch as I was bored, I came across Banshee. After seeing the first series. I can definitely say, I'm hooked. ",2014
8,"This is the most talked about TV series at this time, and this is because of its ruthless pace in the storyline. Speaking of the very 1st episode within 5min from the start what we get to see is, an Ex-con, Drugs, sex, nail biting car chase, fraudulent identity and some hand to hand action which make us believe that every object around us is a deadly weapon. Well, now you can make an estimation of the pace of the story telling. Apart from its pace & unique action style, the acting and the making is of descent level, no need to say about the intensity of the thrills. ",2014
9,"I was at work earlier today when I was reading random articles online and I heard of a new show on Cinemax so I decided to check out the trailer. Needless to say, it gained my attention. ",2013
7,"I don't agree with some of these harsh reviews - I find it to be an EXCELLENT series, with the genius touch of Alan Ball (6 Feet Under, True Blood) - yes, there are some imperfections, but the 4 leads work great: the hero, Antony Starr, is cool and tough, the babe, Ivana Milicevic, is SMOKIN' hot, and a legitimate actress, the Pennsylvania Dutch mob boss, Ulrich Thomsen, is uniquely menacing, and the bartender buddy, Frankie Faison, gets the job done as usual. The supporting cast are also excellent (deputies, thugs, etc). The pace is snappy, the plot moves nicely and with suspense,the action is brutal, and I'm definitely hooked on it.",2013
9,"I started watching this by chance. I was scrolling through what downloads had popped up, films etc, and I seen this. At first I thought it was a cartoon due to the strange picture it has for the series. Anyways thought I'd give it a shot and download it. The first episode was a little over the top, what with all the shooting and chases etc, but the story was more than enough to make me want to watch another episode. I thought nothing could top Game Of Thrones or Dexter as my all time favorite TV shows, but this has. The acting from the lead guy Antony Starr is just phenomenal, he really makes you believe it. The fight scenes are really something else. I grew up in a bit of a rough area and was constantly getting into one fight or another, and the fight scenes in this are more than believable. The sex scenes are a bit more explicit than they need to be, but other than that I am well pleased with this so far.",2013
10,"I am watching the series in sequence, just started the second season, and I have been reviewing individual episodes in the IMDb because frankly they are some of the most amazing episodes I have ever seen in mainstream TV.",2014
8,"Banshee is packed full of action twist and holds the attention of the viewer no matter was seems to happen next. Banshee is a show I will be continuously be watching for those very reasons. The plot is incredibly interesting for a action television show, which I have to admit are not my first choice. I tend to stray away from action more or less because I feel the majority of them is mindless killing and weak plot lines. Even though the sex scenes are profound they are extremelyreal, and shouldn't be taken lightly they may be hard to watch at times but if you keep a open mind you should have no problem. the story is the best part of this show and they leave out just enough information to keep you guessing, not as good as breaking bad but a close second or third. enjoy the action and don't miss the bonus scenes after the credits.",2013
10,"I've came upon ""Banshee"" pretty much accidentally - someone mentioned it in his blog. I've downloaded the first season - and it got me hooked in an instant, while the 2nd and especially the 3rd literally took my breath away. The 4th season seemed a bit of a disappointment... at first... but then it just got on par with the previous 3 - in its own way. I don't think there could be a better way of ending the story. HBO and Cinemax definitely should take steps to further promote this worldwide, it's a shame most people I know never heard of this show. ""Banshee"" excels in all aspects - visuals, sound and story. Rough as it might seem, it's got a good story to tell, which just get better as the series progresses. Sometimes the plot twists make your jaw drop and the only feeling you get afterwards is ""WTF was that???"". The characters are very well-written (even the small ones) and also develop with the series, making you realize that the world around us is not just black & white - sometimes evil has more goodness in it that gets the eye. The opposite is also often true. And yes, sometimes, to do somebody any good, you need to get out of their lives - for good. The soundtrack deserves a separate praise - it's just f..king incredible :-) I just wonder whether there could be some kind of ""Banshee: Resurrection"" :-), though I truly doubt it. It would be next to impossible to repeat the success of the original ""Banshee"", as the authors had set the plank WAY too high.",2016
10,"I am always on the look out for new TV series that have substance/quality/good acting and sometimes a bit of just madness. I just finished True Detective and thought that was one of the best writing I have ever had the privilege to watch on TV, better than Breaking Bad (Don't shoot me). Also a massive fan of The Wire/Boardwalk Empire/Supernatural/Game of Thrones/Sherlock etc. The reason I mention these shows is to give you a understanding of the type of shows I watch and I can happily say that BANSHEE IS NOW AMONG THEM!! Banshee incorporates great acting from the two leads (Anthony Starr & Ivana Milicevic). You actually believe there story and as the series progresses (especially the 2nd season) you truly get a feeling of what they have gone through and that kind of relationship makes great viewing The rest of the characters are fantastic as well, from the young Amish girl who only wants to fit in somewhere but at the same time cant help to rebel (Sleeping with Hood & Killing Alex) to the transsexual IT guru that cant help to make ya smile when going off on one to Hood to Carrie's Ukrainian mobster who plays the role as villain/loving father absolutely perfect (disagree? wait till the last episode of season 2) I notice a lot of people saying this is ridiculous with all the sex/violence/plots etc but you have to bare in mind this is produced and directed as a type of comic reveal as part of cinemax's original development project.",2014
10,"This show has the making of a great series, from what I've seen so far a con gets released out of prison after serving 15 years inside for something that he clearly did do but was setup for just the same. ",2013
4,"Banshee is the kind of show that leaves you scratching your head wondering, ""What is this?"" The headlines would have you believe that Lucas Hood (the main character) is an ex-con master thief who gets a second chance at life by taking the identity of the new sheriff in the town of Banshee. There are a couple of problems here. The first is that Lucas meets the sheriff in a bar who provides laughably bad exposition which is almost as contrived as, ""You know, I was hired without anyone knowing what I look like and if I died, it wouldn't matter because I have no family and no one knows that I came here."" He is shot 45 seconds later. The other is that the writers seem to forget that Lucas is a ""master thief"" because during the course of season 1, he makes one attempt to steal a painting and completely messes it up by his own stupidity. Making us wonder, just how good of a thief is he really? ",2013
4,"The first two things I tell my clients are: keep it real and assume the audience is smart. What does 'real' mean? It depends on the genre but generally it means believable as in, ""oh yeah, that could have happened"" within the confines of the story, year/era and place.",2013
1,"That this squalid, pretentious nonsense scores 7.8 overall, in my view reflects pretty poorly on the TV-viewing public. Sadly, for my work, I have had to watch this entire series in great detail. I watch many series and movies in this way and see violence and sex on a routine basis - which is fine when they are somehow meaningful. Banshee does not have plot - merely a flimsy structure on which to hang sex and violence. It does not have characters - merely avatars for the fulfillment of the vilest fantasy. It tells us nothing about real life and fails to uplift in any way. Ask yourself whether sex and violence should become so conflated as to be almost indistinguishable, whether the more violent you are the more sexually attractive you should become. Ask also what kind of pressure young actresses feel to ""put out"" in this way. This is artistically and morally bankrupt garbage.",2013
10,The series 1st episode is very promising. The story take place in a town named Banshee. We see an ex-con (Antony Starr) who has old enemies and a lot of shades in his past. Of course there is a beautiful (or should i say smoking hot!!) female character (Ivana Milicevic) who was this ex-con's ex-lover. And the ex-con (to avoid his enemies and be with her) assumes a dead sheriffs identity. The thing that mostly entertains me is the look on the main character's face. Its like nothings can touch or hurt him. And of course there is the irony of felon becomes law-bringer... Anyways we just have to sit and watch the ongoing episode's to have the right opinion. But kids beware; there is a new sheriff in town...,2013
9,This is a new series that has strong potential. An ex-con leaves jail and tries to pick up where he left off.,2013
10,"I was totally hooked on this show from the very beginning. The suspense is phantastic, as well as the writing. very cleverly done. It has such a variety of characters, and it is easy to get lost in this show. I hope there will be a 5th season. Besides the very beautiful women, the pace of the show is phenomenal, and the cast of character extremely compelling. It has me waiting anxiously for the next episode. I can also see that is there is still a lot of story lines that need to be continued, and explored. I also wish they would make more than just 8 episodes a season. I have rarely seen a show with characters that are from a psychological view so believable. Keep up the good work!!",2016
10,Not interested at all in this series because the summary didn't fulfill what i do like in a series I never picked it up until a friend told me to do so because it's rather not that bad at all. Have seen the two seasons at this writing I must say that it is one of the best series I have seen so far.,2014
10,"Having watched Banshee's first 6 episodes on demand, my wife and I are hooked. With Showtime's Dexter coming to an end, Cinemax Banshee is our new favorite show. I hope it will last for more than 10 seasons. It's that good.",2013
10,"I recently became hooked on this show. Didn't even know it existed. (I don't watch a lot of TV, because I find very few shows that keep my attention. The last show I enjoyed was Dexter, and I think Banshee has Dexter topped. ANYHOW, once I saw my first episode, I immediately spent my entire vacation watching EVERY single episode to catch up. Even to the point where I was dead tired, but had to keep going. LOVE this show, and will continue to watch every Friday night. It is the ONE show we all agree on watching together. No disagreements, because everyone in my house feels the same way. Hooked on this show! Tonight is the night, 45 minutes to go! This is a much watch show!",2015
1,"I have no idea how this can have such an high rating. Plot is bad, characters are worse, acting is wors...er. Everything is so stupid, so uninteresting, i have no idea how could anyone appreciate this.",2015
10,"Two ex-jewel thieves who are star crossed lovers, one who went to prison for the other and who now assumes the identity of a dead Sheriff. A cross dressing computer tech/street fighting hairdresser, an old heavy weight boxing champion/bartender, a shunned Amish/now criminal landowner/butcher/politician, Russian mafia,I mean...the story is just so engrossing with all these amazing characters, and that's not even all of them! I really hope we get another season or ten! I am so addicted! The story is original and the acting is great! The music is brilliant. Love the fast paced action. The characters are colorful and sexy! It is not a show for kids. But it is on after bedtime so that shouldn't be a problem. This show tops Breaking Bad and Dexter in my books, perhaps because Sheriff Hood is so damn sexy as the anti-hero... and I really love both those other shows too! I don't want this show to end...ever! My new guilty pleasure!",2013
8,"The premise of 'Orphan Black' probably wouldn't even have to be half as intriguing as it is - and yet the show would still be fun to watch. Some TV-shows have such a great cast, you'd keep watching simply for the joy of seeing an outstanding ensemble act. To get those kinds of actors is a rare privilege for any show, and 'Orphan Black' is very privileged, indeed. Thankfully, it also has a fascinating story to tell, and that combination makes for one of the most entertaining and most original shows on recent TV.",2014
10,"Not at all sure WHY someone wrote that this is obscene. There isn't bad language, no T&A, no lurid sex, it's just high voltage, very hip and modern television. It also has great music and mind-twisting story lines mixed with witty dialog. The premise is unique. I don't want to spoil anything but after three episodes it's apparent that what I thought was going on is much more intense and crazy that I'd originally imagined. If you want something different and can go into this appreciating a fresh idea, you're in for a treat. Tatiana Maslany proves to be a very capable young actress. The rest of the cast is equally as entertaining. Enjoy!",2013
10,"As this series aired on BBC America, it seems to me it should have been part of the Emmy candidates. However I wonder about that since it received no mention and as a minimum, Tatiana Maslany's performance in the lead character role is one of the best ever in any media. Tatiana plays the multiple clones effortlessly. Whether American, British, Eastern European, anti-social, nonconformist, conformist, straight, LGBTQ I am never questioning the character. I was a fan and regular viewer of United States of Tara, but Tatiana's performance eclipses Toni Collette's. As I watched each week of the first season, I went from mildly entertained by her transformation to completely believing there were multiple actresses in the show. I would watch the opening credits thinking there were missing actresses! Jordan Gavaris is also great as Tatiana's brother. He brings just the right level of doubt yet support to the character. The story lines, settings, direction are also very good. As video science fiction, I think this is one of the best shows I have seen. It explores many different ethic and moral views - personal, scientific and social - with just enough creepiness to both entertain and make me think.",2013
10,"I know... a 10 sounds a lot for any show. But I have to say, this show has so many things going on for it that I can't help but give it the maximum rating. There is no BS in Orphan Black. Not a trace of the fake beauties that overpopulate our TV screens, there is a great rhythm between the actors, the plot got me hooked by the end of the first episode and there are no unnecessary digital effects whatsoever. ",2015
9,Orphan Black explores the topic of human cloning from the eyes of a human being who happens to be a clone. We are given a fly-on-the-wall perspective of just how human a clone is and just how equivalently human non-clones are. As the first episode begins and Sarah sees her doppelganger we get our first glimpse of the type of consistent and fast-paced plot-development that will draw us through the next 9 episodes. From the five minute mark self-discovery tests the malleability of Maslany's characterization of at least twenty stereotypical human traits ranging from geekitude to amor.,2013
10,"I am just mesmerized watching the actress play so many roles with such differing mannerisms, personalities and even vocal/linguistic differences. I am in awe of her ability. She absolutely needs to get an award for this performance. The premise is unique and a welcome addition to the sci-fi genre. Truly it is one of the best sci-fi shows I have seen in a very long time. There is mystery, romance, danger and with the promise of more characters to be played by Tatyana Maslany, Orphan Black just has to continue for as many seasons as possible. PLEASE. I love the rest of the cast also, (especially her homosexual foster brother who provides some timely comic moments). The excitement just builds and builds as the season unfolds. Love it.",2013
8,"This is not your regular Scfi show where we know all the protagonists and villains in the first episodes( and thats when it starts to fizzle out)With Orphan Black the potential for additional mind-blowing characters is endless ! Its like Scfi soap opera, you never know who is going to walk through the door. Kudos to Tatiana for her ability to keep in character almost all the time. I actually think she has the record over Eddie Murphy in terms of most diverse characters and yes it does look very down to earth in the characterization i.e soccer moms and students but I think thats makes Orphan Black urban , hip and unique. Love to see where it goes from here.",2013
10,"""Orphan Black"" is a highly underrated series starring the woefully underrated Tatiana Maslany. What is the story there? This woman's name should be shouted from housetops. She should be heralded as the next Meryl Streep.",2014
7,"I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2. The premise, acting, settings and character interactions were well done.",2017
9,"I watched the first season in 1 sitting and was totally hooked from the first episode. The show has a suspenseful and fast paced plot- development that kept me most of the time at the edge of my seat. Also what I saw as plot-holes or flaws in the writing were convincingly tied up by the end of the season and turned out to be clues in the first place. Well not completely but most of them and in a satisfying way. So as a whole the production is really good, while they keep the usual trade offs for TV shows in terms of budget and story-structure to a minimum. Overall it's one of the best scifi shows I've seen in recent years - the only thing comparable in terms of viewing experience would be Continuum. ",2014
10,A little late to join the bandwagon on how wonderful this show is. I accidentally watched episode one and completed the first season in a week. I cannot wait for season two to show on Amazon PRIME instant video.,2014
9,"My husband and I heard of this TV show and thought it was an interesting concept but we never got around to watching it because we already had a ton of other shows we were watching! However, over this past summer we had nothing to watch, and just moved and switched cable companies, so we decided to try Orphan Black! And we were hooked, each episode ended with such a cliffhanger or shocker that we had to watch the next episode right away! Luckily the 2nd season finished too so we binged watched the 1st season over a few days and then waited and binge watched the 2nd season! It is a very clever show, and the actress is amazing playing all the different clones! Like we can see and feel that they are different characters, and we've grown to love them all! Highly recommend watching this show!",2014
9,"Tatiana Maslany has to be the most confused actress on the planet. Playing about 8 or 9 different roles and playing them all well is just amazing to me. The show itself is a breath of fresh air. Finally not some lame recycled idea just done with a little twist. This is all new. It took me a few episodes to get into it, as I was very confused at first, but then I just couldn't stop watching. All of her characters play so well off each other, the same yet very different. Her cop partner kind of rubbed me the wrong way, I just didn't like him (sign of a good actor). I just can't say enough about this show. I can't wait for season 2 this April.",2014
10,The more episodes I see of Orphan Black the more I love it.,2013
10,"Really, at the next Emmy Awards, Tatiana Maslany should be all 5 nominees for Best Actress. This has got to be one of the world's all-time most virtuoso performances by anybody anywhere. Not only does she make each of her clones a distinct and memorable character, you can actually tell when one of the clones is assuming the role of a different one — something that happens quite a lot!",2015
10,"Orphan Black is seriously the best show ever... like seriously, no other show even comes close. The fact that actress Tatiana Maslany can play so many characters is mind blowing! Once you start to watch this show, you won't be able to stop. It's that good. I honestly could watch this show all day every day. I pretty much know all the lines. This show will make you laugh, cry, and be disturbed. Not only that but you will be on the edge of your seat. If you like mysteries then you'll like this. Every episode ends with a cliff hanger - something to keep the viewers wanting to know more. It's really great! This most definitely is the best new show of 2013. So check it out! You won't be disappointed... oh yeah and tell your friends!!",2013
10,"I've become attached to this BBC-America series with attractively any-faced Tatiana Maslany (from ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"") as an English-born street-hustler type who discovers she's one of a number of clones in various walks of life, with various Sinister Forces lurking behind these. Maslany can apparently do anything thespian-wise and there's enough technical expertise that when she's playing 2 or 3 characters in the same scene, it doesn't seem just gimmicky. There's a great ""supporting cast"" (Canadians I presume, all unknown to me except of course for the Irish chick from ""The Commitments""), even tiny roles make an impression. I love the dichotomy they've set up between scientific maniacs on one side and religious maniacs on the other. An aura of verisimilitude keeps it from drifting into melodrama or camp; even the swishy gay guy seems a realistic swishy gay guy (of whom I've known a few), not just a stereotype. I've read that the guys behind the show would like it to run for a number of years, which is okay by me, just hope it doesn't turn into a ""Perils of Pauline""-type escapade.... If I had to pick a personal favorite clone, it would have to be Helena, the Ukrainian former ""feral kid"" who (to me) was totally hot even when she just seemed to be some crazed killer who was always hungry, and now that we're seeing her playful and even affectionate side, I'm her biggest fan. The recent scene with her and Sarah driving to ""Cold River"" with Helena hearing the Archies' ""Sugar Sugar"" on the radio and singing along in her idiosyncratic way, with Sarah registering various degrees of dismay---if that's not a priceless TV moment, then I haven't seen one. Go Canada---you Frostbacks have been outshining us Yanks creatively from early David Cronenberg onwards... By the way---for those of you who don't like violence----there's violence---but then you folks probably don't watch much TV to begin with...",2014
10,"I recently started watching Orphan Black and after I watched the first episode I was addicted to the action,suspense and the actors.",2013
10,"The show is great. Multiple people who look just like you plus danger surrounding it. Many people have this feeling of having multiple identical sisters/brothers in the world, especially when you hear ""I know someone who looks just like you"". I am surprised this premise has not been presented before. Also it has a danger element, which keeps me watching, and my heart pumping. I can really relate to Sara. The mystery deepens and I can't wait to find out what happens next. I hope Sara's boyfriend is loyal to her and not a traitor. Please keep this show going, I don't write reviews, so this show is special and I would like to see many seasons in the future. The crazy blond is a little out there, but apparently a key.",2013
10,"I do not recall ever being as captivated by a television program as I have been by Orphan Black. It is a masterpiece among the science fiction genre; with dialogue as good as any dramatic program. I enjoy watching scenes shared by more than one of the clones played by actress Tatiana Maslany. Each has very unique mannerisms, vocabularies, accents, confidence levels, etc. The personalities among the clones are vast, from the orphaned Brit Sarah, to the psycho-killer Helena. Other clones include: the repressed suburbanite Allison; the dread-locked PhD student Cosima, the drab cop Beth and still others. For a young actress (28), Ms. Maslany ranks in my estimation with acting greats such as Helen Mirren and other classically trained actors with extensive, big theater experience. It is noteworthy how the egos of the clones have been shaped by nurture (or lack thereof) more predominantly than by nature. For example, Cosima is self-confident; with a beautiful countenance that radiates from within. Helena is at the other end of the spectrum, with ugliness that is equally staggering, and facial expressions that reveal her instability. With each of the clones being from different walks of life, the supporting characters in their lives also bring tremendous breadth to the story. This might seem a bit messy, but they manage to make it work seamlessly in the context of a great story, with direction and acting unsurpassed in former years of television. In the 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson broke ground introducing us to an unfamiliar dichotomy with the characters Doctor Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. That story has always intrigued me, but Graeme Manson and John Fawcett transcended that duality to a degree without label, except perhaps, 'multi-faceted.' If you shun most science fiction as too incredible, requiring viewers to put reason on hold, I am pleased to report that although Orphan Black breaks novel ground, it manages without an affront on your intellectual capacity. I recently spoke to a friend who has not watched British programming since Benny Hill originally aired on his 13 inch Black & White. If you haven't watched the BBC in recent years, they have a tremendous line-up. They have become known for having clever programming with exceptional casts. Though when all of the actors appear as brilliant as in Orphan Black,credit must be given to the direction from the top. I would sincerely like to see actress Tatiana Maslany, supporting actor Jordan Gavaris,who plays Sarah's eccentric brother Felix, and Executive Producer/Co-Creator/Co-Writer/Co-Director John Fawcett receive Emmy awards for their work on this premier season.",2013
10,"American Networks could really pick a up more than a few clues about pacing, presentation and marketing some clues from BBA America. Comedy shows aren't really my thing, but I love sci/fi and drama, and have been busy catching up on Orphan Black, Copper, Ripper Street and more. Orphan Black (and can I just say that Tatiana Maslany is amazing and mesmerizing in the lead role) had me hooked from the first commercial I say prior to its premiere Every episode is full or twists and turns and drama. The characters are amazingly well written and completely distinct from each other, but each is acted beautifully, and each complement each other so well that they are each part of the puzzle. Down to the last shot, each is set up and beautifully filmed to the tiniest detail. As this season goes on, the show has not become stale, and each episode provides tiny bits and pieces to add to the whole story. There is no skipping ahead, and I defy anyone to see what's coming next. I DVR all episodes to go back and review past episodes, just in case I missed something. Consistently, i0 out of 10 for each episode and I can not wait to see how this show develops in the future.",2013
10,"To be honest, I didn't wait for this show. I didn't know what was it about. My girlfriend watched the whole first season and recommended it to me. I have to say that this bought me in the first three minutes of the pilot. ",2014
9,"Having seen the films based on Thomas Harris' novels, I couldn't for the life of me imagine an actor other than Anthony Hopkins for the role of Hannibal Lecter (although I had seen - and liked - Brian Cox' take on the character in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter' which was released before 'The Silence of the Lambs'). Apart from that, I didn't see the point in retelling a story that had already been told very well on film – and with outstanding actors. For those reasons, I deprived myself of the pleasure of watching 'Hannibal' until the second season of the show started - but boy: am I glad I finally got over myself and did start! ",2014
10,"Anthony Hopkins can be proud of having created one of the first original horror characters of the postwar era. His Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter has rightfully earned a place in the pantheon of legendary monsters. Hopkins was only the second actor to have won an Academy Award for playing a villain, the first being Fredric March for his remarkable performance in the rarely-seen ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931). The American Film Institute lists Hopkins' Lecter as the #1 screen villain in movie history.",2013
9,"If you're wondering, this drama does not follow the story line of the previous Hannibal film franchise. However, it does not mean that the series doesn't pack its own punch in terms of tension and suspense. (I'm in such awe, I feel inadequate trying to leave a review for this show. I won't reveal any more than what is available on the wikipedia page.)",2013
9,"If you are a bit skeptical about this show like me, do not worry. With all the sequels and prequels we've seen regarding Hannibal Lecter, it's an understatement to say there are lots of areas where the creators, directors and actors to over play the gore and story arcs. However, they've managed to balance all these superbly. The title may be Hannibal, right from the start this show is very much a vehicle for Hugh Dancy. Who as Will Graham gives an excellent perspective on his character and i dare say he does a better job than Edward Norton. Mads Mikkelsen with his subtle approach on Dr.Hannibal Lecter is a revelation. His sophisticated and stylish portrayal is captivating and very unpredictable. The show delivers on every front- the writing, editing etc is as good as it gets. Can't wait to see the next episode. Highly recommended it you're looking for a clever and engaging physiological thriller.",2013
10,"If one can put away all the movies aside, store you're memories of them some far off vast empty place in your mind, and watch Hannibal without any recollection of the previous films, Hannibal will blow your mind! This show goes where no one has ever gone before...deep into the mind of Thomas Harris. Deep into the minds of all his characters from Red Dragon.",2013
10,"My favorite three shows right now are Mad Men, Game of Thrones and Hannibal, and while they are vastly different in subject and style, they share several traits that make them a cut above the rest. The writing is excellent, the acting well played and the actors perfectly cast, and all three have a production value and aesthetic that elevates them above your average show. There is a sense of perfectionism and obsessive dedication to quality by their creators, which I think is what makes their fan bases as loyal as they are. There is a sense that the authors are writing to an audience they respect. There is no spoon feeding of plot or dumbing down of dialog. Intelligent characters are consistent in their decision making; things play out in a manner that makes sense, allowing one to relax into the suspension of disbelief that is so addictive about good storytelling. Every detail is delicately handled and placed just so.",2013
9,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this, and the preview/promo that I had seen didn't make me much excited about it. But honestly, I kinda loved the pilot and see a lot of potential here. Hugh Dancy is superb as Special Agent Will Graham and Mads Mikkelsen does justice to the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Exceptional acting all around...",2013
10,"The story is so packed with different things happening. It is forty minutes long, yet it feels closer to an entire film. It is quite fascinating and highly entertaining. It is not filled with eye candy, but with deeper dialog with some special effects. It gives the viewer a deeper insight into the borderline delusions of the main character.",2013
8,"Two episodes in and I'm admiring this curiously crafted, visually stunning (and very risky) program. I entered into this show as a fan of the novels and films (with the exception of 'Hannibal' 2001). Last week's pilot was considerably rushed (I felt an extra 30 mins to flesh out the crime would have evened the pacing) however this 2nd episode really nailed me with the tone, and development of the characters. Hannibal and Will Graham, predator and prey (one character unwittingly). Sure there are some cheap moves for shock value and and certainly the investigations are rushed to make room for the greater psychological thriller, yet the time and craft spent on creating haunting atmosphere and imagery really help to dispel the smaller annoyances. This show is as sophisticated as the sauce being served with Hannibal's loin of pork. ",2013
9,"I don't normally review TV shows, but after seeing the pilot of Hannibal, I am compelled. As the (arguably) foremost monster of all time, Hannibal Lechter still fascinates and appalls us at the same time. His suave, debonair demeanor and taste, combined with his overwhelming brilliance makes him the most attractive monster since Dexter (or Gary Oldman in Dracula). ",2013
10,"I have to say I am very impressed with how the spin-off series of Hannibal Lector has turned out. While I was a little worried at first after hearing the idea to create a series based on the most famous cannibal in the history of film, the series have placed my fears to rest.",2014
2,"This might have worked for a mini-series. But this is a dance between everybody and basically god, it is just stupid. Hannibal is omni sentient and omni potent. He can go everywhere, do everything and knows everything as well. And the FBI makes sure it seems normal. This makes for very boring stuff. No intelligence was put into making Lector a man. No intelligence was put into trying to track him down. Add a prophet that has some divine vision. Aaaaaarghhh forget it, it's just a polished 5 year old cod liver. All visuals, no story. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled. Don't hope for release, this will go on till it's canceled.

4,"1. In real life, profiling is basically worthless. It has never, ever led to the apprehension of a serial killer. (Indeed, no sort of police work has ever caught a serial killer. The only way we ever catch them, ever, is when a victim escapes.) All TV shows about successful profilers are thus shows about people with magic powers.",2014
2,I checked IMDb for a TV series to watch and to my joy one of my favourite film series of all time had been serialised and received a mega 8.6!,2014
2,The good things about this are:,2014
10,This series promises to be incredibly entertaining. Notice the word promises. Here is why:,2013
10,"Boy am I glad that I stumbled onto this series. I was pretty bored with all of the current TV shows which I've been watching (well, that's really only Dexter and True Blood at the moment) or they've been on break. Hannibal hooked me right from the first episode and after seeing the whole season I'd say it's right up there among my favorite TV shows. ",2013
1,"The primary flaw with this adaptation is the portrayal of Hannibal. The actor plays him overtly creepy, yet none of the other characters seem to notice. Hannibal would need a great deal of charm to pull off the things he does, but this guy is as appealing as a cockroach. For some reason, the autistic genius profiler can figure out everything but the fact that Lechter is a killer. And Lawrence Fishburn is sleeping-walking through this thing. Thomas Harris must be spitting up fava beans watching this. This show is hopelessly bad, a combination of cheap '70s slasher shlock and poorly, poorly miscast actors. They are flat one-dimensional figures who evoke no more sympathy than an inert sofa. I'm sure the creators had great intentions but unfortunately they were not realized in this series. Hazy story lines, strange directing but worst of all, the two main characters, Graham and Dr. Lecter, are extremely unlikable. And not unlikable in a deliciously evil way, unlikable in a I-really-want-this-to-be-over-soon-way. The two main characters, Hannibal and Graham, who are being set up for a frenemy bromance are annoying at best and boring at worst. ",2013
3,I can't even see a story line now! The series has just turned to crap. Taken off my watch list. Won't be watching crap anymore. Can't believe some of my favorite series get canceled and they get to make this nonsense! I am certain this will be last series of Hannibal. I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons but i can't even follow this season. I think they are just relying on the name that Anthony Hopkins built for them now as there is no story. The big name characters do not even appear anymore. I keep playing games on my phone to pass time as it is boring to watch. There has only been two episodes and I am not going to watch the rest.,2015
2,"The combination Fishburne/Mikkelsen together with a pre-RedDragon-story sounds really convincing, complex, explanatory. Cast, making and overall picture and effects (if one may say so) seems to put the scores somewhere around the tops of the tops. But in my opinion, it's not. The plot so far (S01-Episode 2) does not only lack on tension, deepness and the thrill of ""the human flesh and the story on canibalism"", it mererly seems as a strange copy of the CSI wherever story. There is simply no story other than: how strange the killings are and how twisted the protagonist feels. The usual suspects are found so fast, that it's killing the whole credibility. It's therefore not the center of the story. But there is no other content, than some strange killings and occasional meetings with Lecter... Fishburne and Mikkelsen are two too big-shots, Hugh Dancy plays the twisted protagonist Special Agnet solving the cases - but falls short in between the other characters. I already feel bored, and my question already is: is that all, folks?",2013
3,"...not to mention incredibly bad casting. Maybe no one else is old enough to remember the original ""Red Dragon"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" works- or the original ""Silence of the Lambs"" film with Hopkins, but it seems like the writers came to a unanimous decision to recycle as much of the dialogue as possible to avoid wear and tear on their cerebral matter. And casting- hello? Lecter is almost universally considered to be a small, slight wiry man- not physically imposing in the least. His physical strength is entirely hidden, like a Zen Aikido master's. He looks non-threatening, reassuring. The actor, while quite competent in his own right, looks more like he would be at home playing a Viking berserker or a senior NCO in the cold-war era Soviet Army. You wouldn't feel at ease giving him your name, rank and serial number, let alone your life story. Leave this turkey alone, and rent a few early eps of Dexter.

1,"There really is only one way to describe this highly anticipated and controversial series. Pretentious clap trap dressed up as serious Television. Obviously inspired by the work of David Lynch (and one suspects Stanley Kubrick) it falls woefully short on every count. There are plot holes so large you could drive an Airbus through them. The only redeeming element is Mads Mikkelsen who makes the part of Hannibal Lecter, very much his own, even managing to cast off the giant shadow of Anthony Hopkins. To all those acclaiming and applauding this snooze fest as the next best thing in intelligent Television, there is a little voice calling from the throng... ""But, the Emperor is not wearing a new cloak"".",2013
8,"The number of I-hate-you-then-I-love-you moments I have had during watching NBC's Hannibal since it started in 2013 until it sadly (for us viewers) ended last Saturday is too great to count. However, the disappointment I am feeling right now because I will see no more of Hannibal is a success in and of itself. At first I did not know how to go about this review in the most logical way possible (it is really hard to convince my mind to do so!) so I came up with the 'ingenious' idea of putting my remarks into points as randomly as they jump to my head:",2015
10,"We have come through the last couple of years with some excellent TV programming. dialog, writing, directing, acting some of the episodes if not entire seasons trashing anything that was showing at the local megaplex. Just like most here I was highly skeptical at the idea of a made for TV Hannibal, as Robert Downey is to Iron Man and Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine.......for me Anthony Hopkins was to Hannibal Lecter. Well no more. When telling people about this show, that's what I use as an approach. When you think of Hannibal Lecter you tend to think of Anthony Hopkins. Well not anymore, what a tribute to Mads Mikkelsen that he could take this amazing pop culture character and and so firmly attach his name to it. If you have been skeptical or just not ""seeing"" you're doing yourself a great disservice in not checking this out. I absolutely LOATHE that comcast now charges for past seasons of network shows, but this is the only one that I would ever say is worth purchasing and viewing before season 3 gets here. Hannibal is excellent television.",2014
10,"Why do you go to the cinema? For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema.",2013

I am confident, however, that I shall not change my view on ""About Time"", the sheer brilliance of which has quite bowled me over. It's not only one of the very best films I have seen recently. It's one of the best I have ever seen. Yes, I think it's that good.",2013
10,"I just don't understand how people are not liking this film. It is just perfect!!! Any Richard Curtis movie I rate against Love actually, because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites! But About Time for me beats love actually hands down. The film is so well thought out and the cast is just so good! I have seen this movie twice already as it was such a great story. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't be too worried about the travelling in time, it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic moments when things go wrong. Don't listen to the haters, this really is a fabulous movie! It is a sad thought though that this could be Richard's last film he is going to direct, I hope not, but if it is, what a way to end his brilliant films! ",2013

10,"I loved this film. I perfect balance of story, humour and sincerity along with excellent acting and a wonderful cast. Even the soundtrack was superb. Not your average time travel movie. Very thought provoking and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way. Some reviews complain about how it is like this or that film. No film is unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour. Forget about all that and enjoy what is a great film which will inspire you in ways you were not expecting. Thoroughly enjoyable and I'm already looking forward to going to see it again.

7,"Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com, but it is so much more than that; it's about family and the smiles and cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments.

8,This movie is truly a piece of art. It has so many materials. I didn't know that it was possible for a movie to have so many materials. What doesn't this movie have??? The story is marvelous. I really liked the way this movie showed the meaning of life. At many point of my life I also wanted to change some moments that occurred in my life. That's why I liked the movie very much. It just didn't show some lame romantic or comedy that show in many movies these days. It's a complete masterpiece. It gave the most realistic scene that any movie can show.,2014

1,"Greetings viewers. Welcome to the saccharine world of Richard Curtis where, just like ALL his other cinematic concoctions, love conquers all and life is fulfilled - as long as you happen to live in a fantasy version of London where a) it's always summer b) you live in (the incredibly expensive) St. John's Wood/Maida Vale area, c) ethnic minorities are non-existent, d) everyone has a middle class job in law, the arts or publishing, e) children never cry - they are just massively cute all the time, f) you have wealthy parents rattling around in a huge house by the sea, g) you have a kooky sister and an eccentric uncle for comedy relief and h) you are a less handsome but not unattractive ginger version of Hugh Grant. Curtis' storytelling template never waivers from the success of FOUR WEDDINGS and NOTTING HILL and this derivative bilge is the 21st century equivalent of ""All Americans still think London is foggy, lit by gas lamps and transported by horse and carriage."" Oh, and don't forget - if you need a passage of time let's have a montage set to a bland love song that takes place in a single location. The writer's claim that no adjustments are made to suit US cinema-going sensibilities is plainly untrue. One of the most truly awful, shamelessly manufactured examples of cinematic product I've ever had the misfortune to witness.",2014
5,"I approached About Time with very low expectations. It hasn't arrived with the same fanfare or same star power as many of writer/director Richard Curtis other blockbusters (Notting Hill and Love Actually for example) and the trailer implied something slightly twee rather than truly uplifting. But sometime during the first fifteen minutes I berated myself severely and settled in to what started out as a very sweet, tender and gently amusing film.",2013
2,The sad thing was that this film started off really well. I was enjoying it. In the moment and . absolutely Nothing happened. It seemed to be a story about a character who used his time changing powers to change silly insignificant things ( like how good he is in bed) and so much of the plot is wasted with those things that there is very little real story. About two thirds of the way through there is finally some action when the protagonists sister is involved in a car accident but again this really does little to further the plot point. I personally believe this story would be better suited to have been a romance. Marrying the happy couple off right away was a mistake in the plot and leaves little room for adventure. This is just one of those films that has so much potential but misuses it. Not a patch on Love Actually or Notting Hill 2 stars from this user,2013
6,"ABOUT TIME is one half snappy romance and another half family drama which lures us into the tutelage of some very beneficial ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" truisms like ""value your life and live everyday fully"", ""notice the beauty in the small things around you"" and ""be brave to say goodbye to the beloved and move on"", such and such. And under the sine qua non of a time-travel set-up. ",2014

7,"An ordinary 21 year old man is shocked to discover that he has the ability to travel through time, a concept which, granted, is not new to the world of cinema. Although this unusual ability is naturally the main theme of the film, the plot still engages the viewer with the struggles of every day life including marriage, finding a job, having children as well as a few family issues to keep the plot fresh. The intriguing plot complements the few time-travelling excursions and keeps the idea crisp.",2013
7,"""Live each day as though it's your last"", are you f___ing kidding me? I don't even think a kid in high school writing a story/play would have the balls to use such a cliché. Perhaps one would imply it, but this movie has the gall to say it straight up. And that's just the tip of the ice burg. This movie probably holds the record for most cliché's ever in a movie. Overall it's not a movie I regret watching, it's a somewhat entertaining movie. I especially enjoyed it's secondary characters. ",2014

Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.",2013
7,"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. ",2013
9,"Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.",2013
5,"It's a great movie, sensational, effective thriller, blah, blah , blah. I don't want to repeat things that have already been said. I'll just say what annoys me. Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that?",2013

9,"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.",2013
4,Just watched it. Acting great.,2013
3,"The most complex thing to think about the film Prisoners is why any of the Oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place.

4,"The beginning of the movie was fine, good with the RV and the girls leaving. The movie really fell apart when they brought the Alex guy into the police station. They say he has a low IQ so he couldn't have done it alone. OK thats great but why then would you not look at his guardian after that? And he was a kidnapped boy himself so wouldn't he be in the system? I know he was not arrested , but seems to me they would check more then his name for a double kidnapping. Not to mention he wouldn't has a ssn and they can tell when he got it under that name which would lead to a DNA test anyway.",2014

2,"I really didn't like this movie. Not because of the gore, not because of the language, but because of the pacing, the acting and most definitely the ending. The movie went on for two hours and they left it hanging at a really stupid time - if you're going to purposely leave the ending hanging, leave it at a time point where it's a bit ambiguous and up to the viewer how it ends. But they left it hanging at a point where it's pretty obvious what's going to happen next, but denying the viewers the chance to see the story wrap up (why????)",2013
5,"I had no expectations of this movie, as I was dragged along to see it by a mate with a Jake Gyllenhaal fixation, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was a bleak-seeming action/drama with Hugh Jackman too, who's generally excellent in everything he's in. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very ""based on a true story"" and had me on the edge of my seat. As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to lose my interest.",2013

Poorly written way way way way too long and so filled with lies clichés and stupidity it boggles the mind. I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the writer, director actors and everyone else. Don't see this film. Boycott it, and if not tell your friends to forget it, God it was awful!!",2013

The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour.",2013

3,"Let me start this off by saying that I generally like Disney films, and that this is not some anti-kiddie flick internet geek writing this. Now that I have that out of the way, I would like to tell you how terrible this movie is. First of all, there is only one song that I think was actually good. The first song in the film is a fantastic number about the hardships of winter, with a great track, expert vocals and a grand, sweeping tone. The rest of the songs are not nearly so good, as they are all sung by the protagonists, which is fine the first few times but gets really monotonous by about halfway through. The movie also wasn't especially funny, which is a saving grace in some of Disney's other lackluster releases. The comic relief character was okay (in that he wasn't nearly as annoying as everyone else) but he was only there to provide some moderately executed slapstick comedy, and the only funny spoken line in the movie. While the script is fine for a TV special or maybe the first episode of a Nickelodeon series, it is definitely not right for a high-profile animated film. Let's just say, there are trolls. Singing, incredibly annoying trolls who show up basically just for the hell of it, and then disappear without a trace. And, while there was one character turn which was actually quite well executed, it is wasted almost immediately, because it changes absolutely nothing about the story. No events drastically alter because of it, there's no clever subtext, and the entire thing feels like it was just inserted so the screenwriter could show how clever he was. I mean, the trip to the cinemas wasn't completely pointless. There was a quite funny Mickey Mouse cartoon they played before the picture, and the trailer for the Lego movie looks like it could be worth something. Otherwise, this movie was terrible. Avoid it if you can, unless you have some kids you need to get out of the house. If so, make sure you bring a good book.",2014
6,"It is sort of disheartening going into Disney's production of ""Frozen"" to report that this is a project that Walt himself had been tinkering with as far back as the 40s, disheartening because the result falls far short of spectacular.

The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. ",2013
1,"By ""worst Disney movie"" I do not mean the worst movie ever made. I hold Disney to a higher standard. So when I saw this film, with all of its hype, I came out of it not only disappointed, but utterly frustrated. This film, save its visuals, does very little right.",2014
1,"I was so angry after watching this movie that I had to make an IMDb account just to write this review. This is HANDS DOWN the WORST Disney movie I have ever watched. Why is it getting so much praise? Beats me, but it seems that today's moviegoers are extremely easily pleased. I, on the other hand, am embarrassed for Disney for having released such a terrible movie. I am even MORE embarrassed for the Academy Awards which presented this terrible movie with TWO Oscars. Do people even have standards anymore? ",2014
5,"First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.",2014

The usual villains and sidekicks appear but with nothing new to offer.",2014
1,"(Spoilers) At one time, sisters Elsa and Anna knew of and loved to utilize Elsa's (unexplained, apparently genetic? even though no one else in her family has them) ice powers. Then an accident and a warning by the (ostensibly) wise troll – that fear will make Elsa's powers dangerous – prompts her parents to fearfully seclude her, shutting her away from everyone and isolating her from her sister. The trolls erase Anna's memory of Elsa's powers. (No one apparently considers the implications of seclusion and terror regarding the power). The girls grow up. After their parents die at sea, Elsa becomes queen. For her coronation, the kingdom is opened. Prince Hans and the Duke of Weselton are among the visiting dignitaries. Anna promptly falls in love with the prince, and agrees to marry him. When the queen refuses to condone her sister's impetuous match, they argue and Elsa accidentally reveals her powers, prompting the Duke to demand that she be arrested. Elsa flees, accidentally shrouding the world in ""eternal winter"" and leaving in power Anna, who promptly follows after her – appointing Prince Hans to rule in her stead (!!!). Apparently in this world, chains of command, diplomatic decorum, and other such trifles cease to exist. Anna loses her horse, and then teams up with a poor boy named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. They all end up working with Olaf, a quirky snow creation of Elsa's, to find her sister. A romance blossoms between Kristoff and the fickle Anna. Meanwhile, Elsa has embraced her ""bad girl"" image (complete with sultry walk/slit up the thigh), building herself a lovely snow palace. The girls talk. Things don't go well, and Anna ends up with ""ice in her heart"" (which the trolls, long ago, had warned would kill her but for an act of true love). In the meantime, Anna's horse had returned to the city, and Hans and a group of soldiers go looking for her. They arrive just after Anna, Kristoff and co are expelled. Weselton's men attack her, a fight breaks out, etc. Elsa is captured. Kristoff, meanwhile, reveals that he had been adopted by trolls – the same ones, coincidentally, that had offered their advice to her family years before. The trolls explain that only an act of true love can save Anna. Kristoff and Anna race back to Hans, for a Kiss of True Love (TM). Kristoff delivers her and leaves. Hans reveals – gasp – that he has simply been after the throne all this time, and locks her in a room to freeze to death. He then claims to the ruling council that Anna is dead, but that they had been married before she expired (witnesses, marriage certificates and funerals apparently don't exist in this world either)...so that makes him king. They welcome him with open arms. Thankfully, there are no other heirs, distant relatives, or people who remember that they still have a queen alive (!!) around. He (with no explanation) believes he can get Elsa to turn back winter. Meanwhile, Kristoff and Sven are coming back because, true love. Elsa, in her grief at learning of Anna's supposed death, accidentally unleashes a tornado-strength blizzard. Kristoff and Anna are going to kiss, but Anna sees Prince Hans about to murder Elsa. She intervenes, and almost freezes; but, that being an act of true love, she is saved. At this point, Elsa figures out how to recall winter (""Love!"" - that's it, no explanation). ",2013
1,"I have said before, it is difficult to get a good review from Me, sometimes I give movies the benefit of the doubt, but not in this case. Frozen is arguable one of Disney's poorest films, from the laziness with animation, to the awful songs. I feel that the trailer is better than the actual film, and I don't see what the hype is. First of all, the beginning of the film is weak and hardly tells You anything about what You are watching, I mean a song about Ice? Besides this the story is entirely to rushed, and can be confusing at parts because the story is moving so fast without a pause. Now, let Me say something about this soundtrack....Just No....Most of the songs in the movie were pointless, came in randomly, had little to no thought or story, and didn't make Me feel anything but annoyance (Yes, I even thought Let it go was a bad song) Moving on to the Characters, all I can say is what was Disney thinking?! The characters in this movie are way to goofy and hokey for my liking, they don't even act like real people! They are simply nothing more than one-dimensional, cookie cutter, forgettable, and complete disgraces. Half of the characters are not needed in the movie and their roles could have been so much better! None of the characters had a strong personality or something about them that just stuck, they are nothing to rave about, they were all just flat to Me. Despite all of these things the worst part is there was no emotion! There was nothing real about this movie! It's just a pathetic excuse for an entertaining family film, the other thing is the villain is just sorry! Even though this was successful in the box office I would NOT waste my time watching this film again, I wish I hadn't seen it. Also I have to be honest, this is the most irritating film I have seen in a long time. So with that I say please, don't waist Your energy or time on this supposed ""movie"".",2015

The reasons? 1. fails to explain how Elsa got those unique powers in the first place. 2. the parents death was a joke. so easy, and just put there as a necessary transition for future plot sake. 3. despite the fresh theme and sheer potential with snow and ice elements, there wasn't enough visual satisfaction. 4. it seemed like the movie worked with limited funding. the background scenes were so minimal! they could have done so much more with snow, the interior of the castle, the kingdom, the clothes, the mountain, etc 5. would have been better to see how Kristoff grew up with the trolls",2014
7,"Currently, ""Frozen"" has a very high IMDb score of 8.1. I was actually surprised by this, as I did enjoy the film but though it had some plot problems that prevented it from being among Disney's best in recent years. Apparently, other folks don't agree with me.",2014

10,"A lot of people criticize Frozen for what it isn't. Their preferred setting, cast, etc. Not for what it is. It is an incredibly touching story with fantastic music, score, script and performances by Menzel and Bell we haven't heard in a long time. I took 117 nieces and nephews ages 18 months to 14 and not once did any of them get up to ' go to the bathroom' or get more snacks. Boys, girls were both drawn to the film the whole time. The younger kids responded more to Olaf than the thematics of it all. ",2013
3,I have a couple of issues with the messages in this movie. ,2014
1,"This is one of the worst movies of the entire season! The storyline was not well-thought out. Considering they shelved the project multiple times and only picked it up again after the success of Tangled, they should have shelved it again until they further thought out the storyline! Frozen's singers don't cut it. I don't mind pop singers like in Tangled, Princess Frog and Brave, but these ones were just bad! You literally struggle to hear them over the instruments that are playing during the songs they sing. During some songs, it sounds as if the singers sometimes practically give up on singing altogether and just shout. There's a duet of the sisters in particular that I'm referring to (For The First Time in Forever (Reprise)). The animation and audio quality did not match the songs. This is most evident in the song Let It Go. The words don't match the lip movement, and the audio sounds out of place.",2013
7," Idina Menzel was miscast. Her speaking voice was almost acceptable, but singing-wise, it didn't suit Elsa at all.",2014
8,"This is really a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And it's just that a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And basically a fairy tale. One that moms and dads can feel happy to take their children too. Let it be that. Is there anything truly remarkable about it? Probably not. Are the songs particularly inventive or that much different from all the countless other Disney movies? No, not really, but they are catchy and pretty and fit the movie. And the ""In Summer"" song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed! But, catchy.",2014
10,"This is a huge movie, seriously huge. You can tell the Disney animation studio really put mountains of effort and it shows they're firing from all cylinders now. Music and awesome sisterhood story separate this from many animation offerings of the past. Also the computer generated animation is really cool, pun intended. The quality is top. I have a sister and so i felt this deep connection to this feature. I won't lie i was moved to tears. I ended up visiting my sis and giving her a huge hug which totally caught her off guard. I am really happy to see a movie that can connect worldwide and with something so simple and profound and that is sibling bond and its special quality is demonstrated really amazingly and with a lot of tenderness. I have been singing part of your world and reflection for years and i feel that let it go and most songs i will be singing for years to come. It was new and yet nostalgic and took me back to my childhood years and recreated the spirit of the movies i adored tenfold. It has something for everyone and that is why i loved it so much. Everything from action and romance and comedy and fantasy and not forgetting the tears. Many movies from Disney are always uplifting and this one was even more so and that made this a very special experience.",2013
3,"Strong female leads are nowadays more desirable than they ever have been. Frozen capitalizes on this as strongly as possible, but fails at almost every turn. Their attempt at showing a more platonic love story is misguided and blunt with it's delivery. The story is full of plot holes and strange plot devices that make little to no sense within the context. The relationships feel forced and the message of the movie feels completely benign. Albeit, I am writing this from a 22 year old male's perspective, but having grown up with Disney movies and after the sheer gold that was Tangled, I have certain standards. ",2015
1,"These people giving it a 10/10 and calling it ""The Best Disney Movie Ever"" have clearly never seen older Disney movies. If they had, they would know that this movie pales in comparison to the majority of Disney's animated movies. This whole movie has become so overrated that it has become a sort of cult. It is quite surprising that such a dull movie has managed to accomplish such a feat. That being said, before you label me as someone who gave a low rating because they're ""too old for Disney"", I'd like to say that I still enjoyed many of the recent Disney films, like The Princess and The Frog, Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph. If you're a true Disney fan, you will find that this movie cannot hold a candle to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Cinderella, Pocahontas, Sleeping Beauty, or Snow White. Similarly, the more recent movies, like The Princess and The Frog and Tangled, were both much more enjoyable than Frozen.",2014
1,"This movie has become so popular that a 2nd movie is/was due out later on. I really don't understand the appeal of this movie. The jokes were predictable and the characters weren't very appealing. The only remotely good song on the list is ""Let it Go"" but since it's become such a popular song, even it's not good enough anymore. Heck, this movie was popular well beyond its debut in theaters. Olaf was your typical ""just for laughs"" idiot that really provided no humor at all. When you get right down to it, it's a children's movie that shouldn't be anywhere near as popular as it is. It's so popular that even knockoff toys were made. I could care less about the ""amazing animation"" when a movie is this bad.",2015
10,"The last time Disney adapted a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, we got one of my favorite films, The Little Mermaid. Now, we have a movie that has very much the same feel as Mermaid. Frozen feels like it could fit right in with the Disney movies of the late 80's/early 90's, like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The music is great, and I left singing it; the lead characters are very likable, with memorable sidekicks; and there are even surprises, things you would never expect to see in a Disney animated film! This is my favorite movie of the year so far, and may even be my favorite movie in years. I highly recommend this one!",2013
5,"Watching frozen before all the hype would probably have been a more enjoyable experience. Sadly, I have missed it when it went out in cinemas.",2014
10,"I enjoy British crime dramas. I find the pacing and depth of characterization is more engaging than the better American shows and there is often more emphasis on ""mystery"". Meanwhile I find the Americans are more innovative and the plots seldom have the holes that sometimes mar British crime stories. Broadchurch is a marvel. I have never seen a TV drama that explores the emotions of so many characters so convincingly. Crimes are traumatizing. Broadchurch gets this perfectly. Nor have I have ever seen a crime drama that packs a visual punch in so many scenes. The Dorset coast is a character in Broadchurch. It plays its role as effectively as any of the brilliant actors in this piece. And that brings up the acting. You won't find a weak performance and some are unforgettable. There were times when I was reminded of how exciting it was watch Sopranos for the first time. Broadchurch may even have the same kind of influence on future television filmmakers. It transcends comparisons between the US and the UK. It's a new standard and an instant classic.",2013
9,"The only reason why I'm not giving it a 10/10 is because I have to leave a little room for humbleness. However, without a doubt, one of the best TV dramas that I have ever seen. It blends human frailty, melodramatic egos among professionals, frigid and temperamental relationships among small town residents, child anxieties, and mistrust, in a very artful way. It also shows the very real side of how people are often confused and blameworthy against everyone especially with the most flimsy of evidence.",2013
10,"I can't say too much how much I enjoyed this series. Unlike most murder dramas, this story isn't about autopsies and gunfights. It's about human nature. It's about the tragedy of the murder of a child. It's about the court of public opinion, the sinister nature of irresponsible journalism, the failures, frailties and flaws of our fellow human beings. This is 'Shakespeare writes a detective story'.",2013
10,"As if more proof were needed --- it is not -- here we see what happens when you allow a very talented production team to dig deep and come up with, essentially, a 7 hour, sequential, melodrama, or crime novel. (Eight hours less commercials). Even Hollywood on its best day can only do 2 and a half hours and is therefore handicapped (and when Hollywood tries to go the distance, the suits involved usually end up eating their own young -- check out ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, an extended melodrama that the late Roger Ebert once referred as the most disastrous editing job he had encountered in his career). Absolutely superb and near-flawless entertainment. Only possible criticism is that the last 9 minutes of the concluding episode are, well, gratuitous and out-of-place, oddly heavy-handed. The acting is stunning, not merely Tennant, who is always good, but the supporting cast is pitch perfect. The story is multi-faceted, a so-called simple murder in a simple town which probes the very souls of the characters involved. ""How could you not know?"" is a line of dialogue that pops up more than once, and is really the signature for the whole piece. If you can, watch it beginning to end and don't be surprised if you simply cannot hit the PAUSE button. It's that good. ------------------------------------------",2013
10,"I have seen a lot of mini series, I love British TV - but I will have to say this is probably the best I have seen. Riveting. unpredictable and intense without over dramatization. At first it took me to a little slow but as i got to know the characters and the story that was progressing, I was hooked. The ending - I didn't see coming. But is was done so well. Relatable to so many people without being over the top. I found every character had such an important role that the ending almost came as a surprise. If you want a show that is realistic without being over the top - but at the same time relateable - this is it!!! I only hope season two is as good. The characters were amazing. The story line was believable. i could not stop watching it. If the other seasons are written with thew same demeanor and the same quality _ i will be sure to watch them all.",2013
9,I have been loving the emotional depth of this show! So often families of murder victims exist merely to give clues for the eventual solution but in Broadchurch we are exposed to the grief of a bereft and torn family.,2013
10,"Broadchurch is a fantastic and refreshing British crime-drama. The 8 part series can be complemented on its beautiful cinematography, compelling acting (particularly the performance of Olivia Colman) and a story that grips you. While the story can be somewhat depressing the depth of the characters and the well constructed plot makes it hard not to watch the series in one sitting. Furthermore, unlike other television shows centered on crime, Broadchurch leaves some subtle clues through out the later episodes, which allows viewers to indulge in guessing the killer. The only criticism is that some of the younger actors/actresses give flawed performances, but this is to be expected. I would highly recommend watching this show.",2013
10,DS Ellie Miller is expecting to be promoted but when eleven year old Danny Latimer is found murdered on the beach it is thought that somebody with more experience is needed. That person is DI Alec Hardy; he has experience with such a crime but as the prosecution failed in that case he may be a liability. Broadchurch isn't the sort of town where such things happen and everybody is shaken; it is also the sort of town where everybody seems to know everybody else but as the case progresses it emerges that many people have secrets and as they are exposed lives will be changed forever.,2013
10,This is a great trilogy of mysteries set in a coastal town in Dorset.,2017
10,"The most extraordinary story ever, written & produced by Chris Chipnall, one of the top British writers today. A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.",2013
10,I get fed up with 'whodunits' where after the first few minutes I have already figured out who did the dirty deed.,2013
8,"I have just finished watching this drama at two sittings. Tense it was, indeed, but its real strength lies in the portrayal of a small, closely-knit community and the explosion/implosion when disaster strikes. It takes place in a southern, sunlit town in Dorset, but the mood is sombre, with hardly a smile breaking the gloom.",2013
3,"I won't reiterate what many others have praised about Season 1. Great acting, good cinematography, good direction, great sense of atmosphere. I enjoyed Season 1...except for a sense afterwards that I had been swindled. -SPOILER ALERT - That sense comes from the fact that the mystery is solved NOT by the detectives, but by the murderer giving himself up - practically out of frustration at not having been caught yet. All that intensity with the two main investigators, and aside from coming up with gossip and small town melodrama (who's cheating with who?), no results from their efforts.",2016
10,"If you are enjoying this show I would also recommend you try The Killing. It doesn't pull at your heart the way Broadchurch does, but still a great plot that takes you down many twisty turns and dead ends. It is filmed here in Vancouver, but it is set in Seattle just across the border in the USA.",2013
8,This is a superbly executed 8-part whodunit series. It will grip your attention right from the start and it will not let up until the end.,2013
8,"I thought Broadchurch was one of the best British drama series I've seen for a long time with outstanding performances from Olivia Coleman (detective Miller), David Tennent (DI Hardy) who try to solve the murder of local schoolboy Danny Lattimer. Also great acting by Jodie Whitaker(Danny's mum) who's performance really makes you believe every second. Also good performance from Pauline Quirk who's great acting made her my initial thought for the murderer. I thought the show as a whole was a well made and well produced show that had everyone guessing. I was however disappointed with the ending but still highly recommended and a solid 8/10 and I can't wait for the highly anticipated return. Thank you 4 reading.",2013
10,"I just saw the first season of Broadchurch. I had heard a lot about it, and after watching ""Foyle's War,"" I thought to myself, well, the bar has now been set for me pretty high. This show will have to be something to outdo it.",2015
10,"I do not like writing reviews, but Broadchurch is a show that demands it. What I love about Broadchurch is that in essence it does not have a lead character. It is not about Miller or Hardy or the Latimers or even the town itself. It is just an extremely compelling story about the human instinct to survive, even if you have to lie or cheat or murder for it. ",2015
6,"Broadchurch is, for the most part, watchable but the mealy mouthed political correctness, is tiresome.",2017
6,The first seven episodes were very good as they kept you guessing and threw up constant twists and misleads. A lot of these covered some real world issues in quite a sensible and clever way. For instance (spoilers...) the newsagent's story gave a very mature look at just how readily communities will condemn people with a history of sex offences and brand them as a paedophile when the reality might be far from that. It also portrays how the media can make things worse and how one person being murdered can have far reaching consequences on everyone around and dig up all these secrets.,2014
5,"Broadchurch is an an interesting, but bleak crime drama rather in the vein of Twin Peaks and Veronica Mars when the main purpose of the series is to find out who killed someone; in this case, it is an 11-year old English boy named Danny Latimer. A small town on the UK coast is the setting. The Latimer family wakes up one morning without realizing that their small son has been killed and dumped on the beach. DS Ellie Miller's day is about to get a thousand times worse when she returns from vacation to find that her dream Detective Inspector job has been snatched away by Alec Hardy, a grouchy Scottish officer who was disgraced after he bungled a child murder investigation. To make matters even worse, Ellie discovers that her son's best friend has been murdered and her deadbeat sister is looking for more handouts. Ellie must deal with her grief over her son's friend, yet still remain impartial and professional. As the list of suspects grows, Ellie and Alec try to discover who would have wanted to kill an innocent boy. Is it his father with his notoriously bad temper? Could it be the local vicar, an outsider? Maybe the nasty woman at the caravan park? Danny's innocent young friend? Intrepid local reporter Ollie? Is the killer the elderly Jack Marshall? Or is it someone that no one would ever suspect?",2014
9,"So Broadchurch has finally come to an end after three series. Chris Chibnall recently rounded off, and moves onto his new project, Doctor Who. It's a difficult series to review overall, the first series was so good, I think it raised the bar for this genre, it was devastating, engaging, and re-opened a genre that had somewhat been underplayed for so long, whodunit. In each series that's always been the burning question, who and why. Series one was fabulous, and gained the show a massive following, approaching 10 million viewers. I enjoyed Series two, although it faced criticism, the third series got the show very much back on form, with a very dark and gritty story.",2017
8,"Growing tired of standardized series, we were amazed by shows as 'The Fall', Luther, Top of the Lake, etc. These shows are not about effects, handsome likable people, clichés, but about acting, character development and actually surprising plots and twists.",2017
10,"Broadchurch is the kind of series that manages to find a place in your heart, even though you never expected it to.",2015
8,8/10.,2013
9,"Baz Luhrmann really has outdone himself in this film. The cast is beautiful as is the script. The scenes are a visual feast. It is as if Luhrmann reached into Fitzgerald's vision of the 20's, pulled out the heart of it and merged it with what society is today, over nine decades later. Alongside personal strife, we see social inequality, abuse of drugs and alcohol, political and moral corruption, and the failure of financial institutions and their responsibility to people. This film will make you feel that these issues will always be relevant, and that not much changes from generation to generation.",2013
10,"After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see so many negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in the first 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films that should by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the film begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits what I like to call ""Baz's golden point"", slows to absolute perfection. That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads, but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives yet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think a lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the ""classic"" status of the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussions should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000 adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, and thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.",2013
9,"THE GREAT GATSBY There is no movie I have been more prepared to dislike than this one. How dare some Aussie come over here and tell us about the meaning of one of the great works of American literature. Especially this Aussie, Baz Luhrmann, who is known to overload, over-hype and overcook his theatrical product into a glittery miasma of small meaning and little consequence. (i.e. Moulin Rouge) ",2013
9,"Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby,"" is fairly accurate to the classic novel and keeps most of its themes intact. However, Luhrmann's own flair adds a new dimension to the story. Visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes. Never once does it not take your breath away from its impressive scenery. Many people might be worried about the updated music, but there is nothing to fear. Jay-Z's track works incredible well with the film and complements the era in which it is set.",2013
1,"The movie starts with a guy who makes many expensive parties in his mansion, to get the presence of the girl he has always been in love with. 1.- It never explains why he can't just go to her, which the book does. This makes an awful ridiculousness of ""Why didn't he just go to her?"" for years. 2.- After he finally meets her, the entire plot for ENTIRE 30 MINUTES is about her not being able to make up her mind about Gatsby or her husband. 3.- The ""climax"" of the story is when Daisy's husband discovers he used to be poor. He breaks out in rage, and Daisy gets scared. That's it. Most of the story wouldn't mean much without the visuals, and most of the reviews were obviously bought. The only thing that makes the movie bearable was Leonardo Di Caprio's performance. The characters' entire importance and ego based on materialism and money are justified not with interesting deep stories, but with plain image and the love Gatsby felt to ""give her everything"", implying a love story strongly based on materialism.",2013
9,"For the record, I've read Gatsby at least every other year since I was 17, so, believe me when I say I have been counting down the days and minutes until the new movie opened.",2013
5,What I thought worked in Luhrmann's Gatsby:,2013
1,"An incredibly noisy mess of a film filled with nonsensical dialog, modern music that makes no sense in the setting and acting like out of cartoons. This director is all flash over substance, seems like he directed it on 10 hits of acid. Nothing original, nothing new about it. This is a film for simpletons and the weak minded.",2013
5,"""In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'"" I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel ""The Great Gatsby"".",2013
4,"Adapting famous and well-respected classic literature can't be easy. The film industry's track record attests to this: for every Ran, there are five misfires that people quickly forget. The filmmakers behind this year's adaptation of The Great Gatsby make the task seem impossible. This movie is a disaster.",2013
4,"First of all, let me say that F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is absolutely one of my favourite novels. Additionally, though it has been years since I've seen it, the Robert Redford film was brilliant and I loved it. From the moment I saw the trailers for this version I was heavily skeptical. Heaven knows that someone like Baz Luhrmann needs to make things flashy and extravagant and put a modern twist on a classic story. He did some brilliant work with Romeo and Juliet nearly 20 years ago. However, I was worried and now seeing it it has been confirmed that his version of Great Gatsby is an excessive, chaotic, bright, jazzy mess that completely misses the entire concept of Fitzgerald's classic. The modern day rap music and remixes weren't awful but also weren't necessary either. The elaborate (and admittedly brilliantly done) set pieces of a bizarre almost apocalyptic New York and surrounding area seemed to just take away from a story that should be entirely character driven. The story does mostly follow Fitzgerald's story and yet at the same time completely misses its mark and the pacing felt off entirely. There is no doubt that The Great Gatsby is not an action flick or anything but parts of it dragged.",2013
6,I watched this film with a sort of tender curiosity.,2013
1,"This is really awful. There is so much wrong with this rubbish...one could write a book about it. Mixing modern music with 1920s music? Hey Baz Luhrmann (director)----cant you live without CGI and additional nonsense??? The 1974 version was not great...........but it was in so many ways much better than this drivel. Robert Redford was a real Gatsby ...his use of the upper class language was 100% better than DiCaprios .....who never got the Gatsby character (he was terrible). Bruce Dern, Sam Waterston, Karen Black, Scott Wilson.....the 1974 supporting cast...... were far superior to this 2013 rabble. The director Baz Luhrmannm came to Australia recently to promote this insult to Scott Fitzgerald on the television media and said he was retiring soon. He needs to. O.K.....Old Sport ?....Fitzgerald would have hated this. He would have also disliked the 4 previous movie attempts at this work. Leave Gatsby alone movie makers----or call in the A team of directors. (and actors)",2013
1,"Plain and simple the movie is awful. I painfully watched it over 2 days as my wife wanted to see it. The cinematography is all over the place and the movie is like watching a cartoon with living characters. To add insult to injury they added Rap music to a movie that takes place in the 1920s. I think the producers were on drugs when they release this piece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that liked Moulin Rouge, or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you may like this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you. Put it like this, watching the laundry turn in a dryer is more interesting than this movie, and the acting is just as good.",2013
1,"Words cannot even explain how horrible this movie was. It was so hard to follow! The quotes were changed and the storyline was also changed. I have read and studied the book so this did not satisfy my hunger for The Great Gatsby. Needless to say I think it's pure filth and the only people who will love it will be people who have no idea who F.Scott Fitzgerald is or have not read the book. The book revolved around the 1920s and the bootleg era, I'm pretty sure this was also the JAZZ era not Jay-Z or Beyonce! The music was horrible and processed! Words cannot explain how horrible it was. I think the director should pay for my treatment! Director was to focused on 3D that there was a cut everywhere. Why would anyone ruin the best Novel of all time? Why?",2013
1,"by far the worst movie of the year. an even worse movie than 'This is the End,' which is saying something. i have no idea what DiCaprio was thinking signing up for this turd, but he mailed in his performance, as did Maguire, and who can really blame them?",2013
1,"Wow. I just returned from viewing the great Gatsby. This movie was by far one of the absolute worst, confusing, and boring movies I have ever seen. The fact that Toby McGuire was the lead speaking voice was embarrassing and humiliating to anyone who considers themselves a fan of this motion picture. This movie had no substance or direction. The amount of CGI used in this movie to display New York City and driving scenes was the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. I wouldn't even give Daisy a 4 on looks, and Leonardo Dicaprio is willing to get killed for her? No way. She was beat. And the music at the parties resembled party rock anthem by LMFAO. Dreadful movie. ",2013
1,How this horrid mess has such a high rating is beyond me. ,2013
1,"This movie is DOA, a victim of the colossal misjudgment of whoever thought The Great Gatsby would be a suitable vehicle for 3-D special effects and tried to turn it into a showcase for them. At best they add nothing to this subtle and complex classic and at worst they distract the viewer from the novelist's intent, masking every other theme of the novel behind a garish attempt to overwhelm the viewer with with a stylized vision of the roaring twenties. The actors struggling to compete with this distraction and bring Fitzgerald's characters and themes to life are at a serious disadvantage before they even appear, and Leonardo DiCaprio simply isn't up to the task. His seems to be alternately trying to channel Robert Redford and Marlon Brando, the former being an improvement and the later a particularly inappropriate source of confusion about the character. Gatsby is supposed to be an enigma, but this is ridiculous. And when those resources seem unable to sustain him, he drifts off into something more reminiscent of Orson Wells, an impersonation that is way out beyond his ability, though in harmony with his bloated and dissipated appearance. The silly device of scattering bits of text into the snow or rain and then assembling them to float in front in front of the screen is no competition for Sam Waters sensitive reading of the same texts. The interjection of a psychoanalytical frame story to explicate Nick's character would be totally unnecessary if a more suitable and capable actor than Tobey Maguire had been cast. I went home and watched the 1974 version, which I had underestimated. In contrast Sam Waters, Robert Redford and Karen Black were nothing less than brilliant. Poor Fitzgerald. What a disservice. But the novel is pretty much indestructible and will live to fight another day, even if it lost this battle.",2013

1,"Coco Chanel said ""Once you've dressed, and before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take at least one thing off."" This is what Baz should have done. In The Great Gatsby's case, a lot more than one thing should have been taken off or out of this film. It is Over The Top; Bad. Too much fake CGI.",2013
1,Genuinely awful movie. Watching Toby Macguire act is like watching a mannequin that's realized its sentient but still chooses to do nothing about it. The cinematography feels like the work of an overzealous child. HEY LOOKS LETS GO ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... HEY LETS GO BACK ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... LETS GO INTO TOWN... WHOOOSH... LETS GO BACK HOME... ZOOOOM. I lost IQ points for sitting through that. I'm secretly hoping that the unobtainable green light on the dock represents the green light for all other future movies this director wants to direct.,2013
7,"I am a great fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing, which I think is some of the finest literature that exists in English. Adapting it to film necessarily loses some of the magic of his words.

9,"What an excellent start, i was gripped within the first 2 minutes of watching the excellently paced 1st episode. This show wants you interested right from the start but there's no tricks or flashy style, just good solid drama. The acting is superb, especially from the 2 moms, it was nearly like watching a documentary of a family in action. I also remember thinking the music the show used was particularly appropriate and very complimentary to the visuals.",2013
10,"I live in a small city in Wisconsin where being gay is rarely spoken about. I am a high school English teacher at a local high school and the adviser for the Gay Straight Alliance. ""The Fosters"" gives me hope and I believe it also gives my students hope. I love the way it normalizes a marriage between two women as I hope to be married someday to a woman as well. This show is tastefully written and beautifully acted. The relationship between Teri Polo and Sherri Saum's characters feels authentic and is well represented. I am appalled by the reviews of others on the IMDb site who feel that The Fosters is ''trashy"" or ""disgusting"" or should not be classified as a ""family show."" This is the truest family show I have ever seen because it speaks to who I am. Shame on those who cannot see past their own biases concerning what it means to be a family. Congratulations to everyone involved in the production of this show. You should be proud of yourselves.",2013

The show revolves around a lesbian couple that foster children, they have twins who want to spend time with their birth mother, a boy from one of the mothers previous relationships, and when the show begins they take on a girl who just got out of juvenile detention.",2013
10,"I am one to be very cautious when watching a teen-drama on ABC Family. After all ""Pretty Little Liars"" isn't the most enthralling teen murder-mystery show and ""Secret Life"" just wasn't sophisticated enough to be smart TV fare. However, ABC Family has blown me away with it's brand-new television series ""The Fosters."" The show starts off telling the story of Callie, a girl in foster care, she's just getting out of juvie and is now sent (her younger brother Jude will join her) to live with another foster family but this one is a little bit different from her other homes. The house is made-up of three other teenagers: Brandon, the biological son of his mom from a previous marriage; Mariana and her brother Jesus, twin Latino teenagers who were adopted when they were children; and we round it up with Lena and Stef, a bi-racial lesbian couple raising the children together. Stef is Brandon's biological mother but that doesn't stop him from referring to Lena as mom too. So now Callie is in this whole new situation that is something she never even considered possible until now. Now the insane weekday mornings getting ready for school and work can begin.",2013
8,"I am so happy that this show exists. It does a great job at bringing foster life to light. There are some fantastic foster families out there, but there are also lots of abuses. This show gives an example of both in a very accurate way. Bravo to the fosters for taking that leap. And bravo to the actors for doing such a fantastic job at playing such emotionally charged roles and doing it so flawlessly. I can't wait to keep viewing and see how their stories unfold. There is so much pain in the world, but the Fosters' house seems to be the cure and can be a model for all families to go by. Regardless of where you come from, you are worth love and the sense of belonging.",2013
10,"This show is amazing not because of its progressive stance (a multi-racial family that includes same-sex parents), but its ability to avoid stereotyping. We could've had a show that took a political standpoint for or against gay marriage, but instead we get a series that paints a loving family going through the trials that all families have to go through. Everyone's different background (the Latino twins, the delinquent foster child, the son from one of the partner's previous marriage) could've been used to create one dimensional characters whose behavior was predicted based on label. However, this show doesn't resort to that. It has a well- rounded cast in terms of acting and has you empathize with every P.O.V. :] Thank you ABC Family for giving us this rare gem. Sad we had to wait till now to get something like this on television.",2013
10,"I first heard about this show at episode 3. I wasn't that impressed with the one episode but thought this is a show I'd like to know more about, so circled back to the pilot and ep. 2. I must say, not only did I change my mind but I want to thank ABC Family for putting this show on the air. It's unique, delightful, real, impressive in all it's warts of family life and a wonder to see unfold.",2013
6,"This show definitely has possibilities. The key word is drama and the set up for this show should allow for many seasons worth. The biggest problem for me so far is the acting. While some members of the ensemble are great, several of the younger actors are so bad it is distracting. While this may be acceptable for a comedy, where overacting is often part of the charm, here it detracts from the drama. It deadens some moments that were meant to be (and should have been) serious. And though I haven't watched the show from the beginning, I wonder how a teacher and police officer can afford the extremely large and appointed home they reside in, especially on the west coast.",2014
10,"Loved the idea. Started to watch it because it contained a family, built by two women. I never watch this kind of TV shows, but the family idea and the message that is installed and thought in every episode catches the attention. Loved the discussion between the loving moms, catholics and a self-proclaimed-catholic father of one of the mom. Great arguments and great writing! There are so many self-proclaimed-catholics who have no idea what the WHOLE bible and teachings are about. They tend to take out lines out of context and apply double standards, ignoring the parts that aren't convenient to them. This show touches many social problems and present one of the possible approaches always carrying love and thinking about others.",2015
10,"Best new show of the year. If you missed this show then do yourself a favor and catch it on one of the sites like Amazon. The writing is great and the acting is wonderful. Highly recommend. This is a family show in every sense of the word. It is based on a loving family. In fact,love is the focus of every episode. We need more shows with that kind of message. This family just happens to be multi-cultural and have two moms. I love that The Fosters shows how very much like any other family that is. I love that it shows that in our homes and our hearts, ""there is enough to go around"". I hope that it encourages many people to open their homes to children who need loving families. I hope that many people see that a family doesn't have to look like a Norman Rockwell painting to be a REAL family. And, I hope there are many seasons of The Fosters to come.",2013
2,"Every person in the show, every week, has a life altering situation to deal with. Everyone is so somber. They all love each other, but there is very little joy or happiness in this family. Both parents constantly drone on about communication, yet they and everyone else in the family are always telling lies or keeping secrets (but it is always purported as to spare others feelings or as an act of complete selflessness toward someone else). In spite of all this, the children are spoiled, selfish, misguided, and care little about others. They continually make foolish decisions and basically turn situations that any normal person would just shrug off into personal catastrophes. The young boy seems to blankly stare off at the ceiling all the time and rarely has anything of substance to say. The parents, if you could seriously call them that, handle every situation in as irresponsible manner as possible. I'm sure they are supposed to represent modern, hip parents, but instead come off as total failures. And enough already with the Dance Team storyline. What educational institution would let students solely audition and pick participants for a sports team? For a show that is set up to offer an endless series of interesting stories, the writers of the Fosters have chosen to take every person, in every scene, of every episode and inject as much melodrama into it as possible. That doesn't make for compelling TV, it makes the show predictable and tiresome.",2015
7,"The Fosters is a great show. The idea behind the show is well executed and feels very modern and believable. As the world becomes more tolerant and accepting, the definition of ""family"" has changed substantially. It's nice to see a diverse cast of characters that blend in nicely together.",2014
5,"Don't get me wrong. This show is very entertaining, but it also crowded to insanity with way too much teenage angst into it's four seasons and that is also its weakness. A top-notch cast led by Terri Polo (Stef) and Sheri Saum (Lena) as lesbian parents of five kids--one of them, Brandon) is from Polo's earlier marriage before she came out and they have adopted two twin Latino kids, Mariana (Cierra Ramirez) and Jesus (Jake T. Austin and later Noah Centineo), who have been through the system of foster homes following the abandonment of their parents to drugs and other issues. The show opens just as they come to care for a sister, Callie (Maia Mitchell) and brother, Jude (Hayden Byerly) who have been in numerous foster homes and been rejected for adoption numerous times. Stef is a cop--competent, almost swaggering him her zeal to be right, while Lena is a teacher for a Charter school. The family lives in one of the most gorgeous Arts & Crafts houses in San Diego you've ever seen. There's no way in hell they could afford this and five kids. Stef and Lena try to instill parental control but it's a losing battle from the get-go as these kids do the dumbest things over and over again. They are in constant peril whether through the foster parenting system that sucks, assumes the kids are screwed up, and doesn't protect them to the constant shifting of their own personal stories. So Jude is gay and has all those attendant issues. Callie can't help her attraction to her older foster brother, Brandon, and the two of them nearly wreck their chances at a solid family life through the first two seasons. Mariana is an insecure, if smart and talented young lady, but she's also a bitch and a troublemaker and can't ever keep a secret, which leads to insane plot lines that cause the family no end of troubles. Jesus is sweet and sexy to the girls but dumb as a post. And if that isn't absurd enough consider: ",2017
8,"I love everything in this movie! The family, the acting, the location, the storyline! I absolutely love it! Bring on Season 2 and I hope it stays as amazing as it is. This TV show always has you in anticipation and is a great watch, I recommend this to teens, you adults and adults. This is a very interesting show that will have viewers wanting more. I tend to watch episodes over and over again just waiting while a new episode premiers. Honestly, this is one of the greatest dramatic TV show I have ever seen! I hope I did not spoil anything for you, but I am hoping that I have encouraged you to watch this show. I enjoyed watching the first season and I hope you enjoy watching too!",2013
2,"Every character is this soap opera is not only flawed but reprehensibly so. Starting with the parents. Everything they do or say is analyzed and misinterpreted by the other to the point of utter ridiculousness. One can not even smile at another adult without suspicion by the other. And, for a family that stresses open communication, all everyone does is lie. Just a few examples: lie about buying a car, lie about going to Mexico, lie about relationship with brother, lie about relationship with sister's boyfriend, lie about foster care license, lie about party when parent's away, lie about getting fired, lie about shoplifting, lie about going to school, lie about getting kicked out of school. Lie after lie. And that doesn't include all the things they do behind the others backs. If this is the typical modern family, it's no wonder every episode is about losing one of the children. These Fosters are the opposite of how a family dynamic should unfold. And, once in a while, could one of them please make an intelligent decision?",2015
9,I happen to catch episode 1 online but wow! Now it's set on my dvr. period. I happen to know blended families...so thank you..,2013
1,"My wife is an avid watcher of just about anything that airs on ABC now simply because that is what she would watch in Jr. High. Because of this, I've had the ""pleasure"" of watching these shows, including The Fosters. I'd first like to state that the idea behind the show is very interesting, which seems to be the only part that ABC is good at because every other aspect of this and their other shows are absolutely abhorrent. I've never been a fan of drama shows, but ABC seems to be able to ruin every show that could be incredible if it was done by any other studio or company.",2016
8,"I love this show, it's a good story and discuss a lot of things in our society, open our eyes to some issues people face out there and we don't know about it.still some people hate to see gays or lesbian like Stef's father, and some people suffered from having black skin like Lena's mother, and some people couldn't fit or adapt in the community for having light black skin like Lena, or being different somehow. how kids got themselves in a troubles and let parents handle it.how foster kids and adopted kids feel, it's hard for them to adapt in a new life and new family and they keep wounder why their biological parents give them away and they think that was their problem and they didn't want them anymore and how much troubles could happen if they're in the wrong family like what happen to Jude when his foster father was beating him or what happen between Callie and Liam she was under age (15 years old) and got involved emotionally with her foster brother and this wasn't enough when she wasn't ready to go further he raped her. the show is great in everything the cast, the writers, the music but i guess it would much better if there wasn't this relation between Callie and Brandon this is the only thing annoying me in this show",2013
9,"I really like this drama about a family. Their parents are two women who are lesbians, and four of their five children are adopted. Different from other drama, they are not rich, I mean, seems middle- income. But they look really happier than rich one, because they are truly loved each other. ",2013
1,"I was very excited to start watching this show. Although most of my favourite shows are HBO and Showtime, I also watch a lot that are not that I really enjoy( Greys Anatomy, Chicago Fire and Parenthood). From what I had heard about the show I was expecting it to be similar to Parenthood, but boy was I ever wrong. The shows don't even compare in my eyes. ",2014
1,"Ever watch a show and say to the TV, ""Stupid kids."" Yeah, with this one you'll also be saying it about the parents.",2016
10,"OK, so before I start my review I just want to say something. A few minutes ago I was reading a review where somebody gave the show a one because they think lesbians are disgusting. That's not really fair. Just because you don't like Stef and Lena's relationship doesn't mean you have to hate the whole show and comment about how disgusting it is. That's very rude! It's fine if you don't agree with gay marriage or you don't like gays, that's your belief. But there's no reason to make it public in such a rude way.",2014
9,"The truth is that this type of series, never liked me. However the strength of the characters and especially the very great interpretation of Maia Mitchell as Callie. Makes the series win incredible strength. Also if I was Maia would be nominated for an Emmy.",2015
9,"I'm usually one to miss out on shows which are classified as drama, but The Fosters is absolutely fantastic! The Foster family is made up of two mothers, Stef and Lena, Stef's biological son from a previous marriage, adopted Hispanic twins and as the show begins, a teenage girl who has just been released from a juvenile delinquent center. It really shows that whilst they aren't your typical family, all that really matters is present. The drama is believable and nothing like your typical 'Pretty Little Liars' type show. As the episodes continue, several plot lines are pursued, and it doesn't disappoint. I am hooked on this show and can't wait for the next season!",2013
8,"This show is miles better than The Vampire Diaries in my opinion. The show has a brilliant cast, characters, great story and good location. I like the way they have made this show darker than TVD and they haven't kept that 'coming of age' type of show. The originals also gives explanations and goes into some detail about the characters backgrounds and helps you understand the story between the Originals and Marcel. Also, the first couple of episodes have made me wanting more without a doubt. No disrespect to TVD, i like that show, I just think that the way this show focus' on the Original family and the story which they have created makes this show a better one than The Vampire Diaries. Definitely worth the watch.",2013
10,"This series has gone far too good beyond its expectations in just two- three episodes, the way its story has picked up speed and the environment they are creating is awesome. Klaus' character as usual is classic and its fun to watch him argue with his brother Elijah and sister Rebekah. Talking about The Vampire Diaries, that show is different in its own way, but there is no way TVD should be compared to The Originals as its story has completely moved in another direction. The acting of all characters is awesome and story is mind-blowing. The flashback story they are gonna show seems to be quite fun as it is related to original vampires. Even in The Vampire Diaries I was a bit biased towards original vampires and waited for their part to come (not only me, happened with many people). So all in all its good they separated out original vampires' story from TVD.",2013
10,"Coming as a new viewer I was pretty hesitant about watching the Originals. I heard that it was a spin-off of Vampire Diaries and I couldn't have been more unimpressed, seeing as I hated Vampire Diaries and what it had become (Elena drama -_-). However, to my surprise it was actually good. Really good. I see most of the reviews saying the pilot was dull and boring however, that was because they had already seen most of the scenes from the back-door pilot in TVD. They made it this way so viewers like me, who have never seen the episode ( I gave up on Vampire Diaries a while ago) could get caught up. Considering how they had to put seasons of information into one episode I think they did a pretty good job of explaining things. The episode was dark and mature and Elijah's love for his family is very heart-warming. I love the sibling dynamic on the show. Klaus the a hot head, Elijah collected and classy, and Rebekah the the indifferent little sister who just wants out of this family. But somehow I got the feeling that no matter what they all still love each very much and would do anything for one another other. And with a new addition on the way I want to see how they all handle this, especially Klaus the soon to be daddy. As for the other characters, Marcel is a sexy tyrant who I'm very interested in learning more about and how he came to power. Hayley the mother of soon to be ""miracle baby"" is a hoot and I loved her scenes with Elijah. I'm also interested in learning more about her past and finding out about her parents. Sophie is the brave witch with nothing to lose in this war, and people with nothing to lose are usually the most dangerous:) I'm curious to see how this war plays out between the Originals, Marcel , and the witches. New Orleans a city with so much history and supernatural lore is the perfect setting for this and I'm fairly certain that this show will be great. Laissez-le bon temps rouler!",2013
10,THE ORIGINALS is a show which has amazed me this season more than the main show TVD(I am not comfortable with a girl hopping in love from one brother to another- I like Ian and Nina as couple but not on the show). ,2013
10,"I am a HUGE Vampire Diaries fan! I wasn't ever really all that interested in the original family when they showed it on Vampire Diaries, nor did I care about them at all.. I found them all to be good actors/actress' but the lot wasn't that interesting... HOLY CRAP! This show is very surprising pleasantly good! Its so interesting and I really like it! Congrats to the creators for making another amazing show and the acting is great!!! The story line is so interesting I cannot wait for the next episode I find myself loving every episode... Julie created another masterpiece. Love the Originals and am so happy to see it succeed along with another new season of Vampire Diaries. So good!",2013
10,"I have been a TVD fan since day 1. However,watching The Original's first episode has made me doubt whether it would be good or not as I thought the story would just rely on it's mother show TVD. However, watching a few more episodes, it is getting better and better and it has actually put me off watching TVD as TVD has got nothing on this show. I have just realized that I have been watching TVD because of the amazing ""Originals"". The main purpose of 'The Originals' is to show viewers that it is based on family and that is the most important thing. Unlike TVD that is based on sickening stupid never ending romance between the Salvatore brothers, Silus, Petrova Doppelgangers, Elena etc. I'm so fed up of it. Hence why I advice you to give TO a shot guys, this show is amazing.",2013
10,I wasn't expecting a vampire diaries spin of to be so good in fact I was kinda upset that they took Klaus away from Caroline ! but my god this show has took over TVD completely I find myself more excited to see what happens I feel like the originals is a grown up version of TVD and I've grew up with it sorta say I love the plot and the twists the drama I hope you give this show a chance because it really does deserve it Klaus was mostly bad in TVD and i think he grew on us all he was such a dominant character he deserved his own show not to mention Elijah his brother as the nice one but will do anything for his family no matter how much they hurt him ( Klaus mostly daggers him and puts him in a box quite allot ) please please if you love TVD you will love this show :) watch it !!,2013
10,"I am SO addicted to this show! I never want it to end! The acting is brilliant...Klaus ROCKS! It keeps me wanting more....I knew I loved vampires for a reason ;) I lost interest in Vampire Diaries very quickly because the story lines were weak as well as the acting....too ""teenager"" 'ish....this series is more captivating and not so immature. Klaus's character is brilliant, scheming, evil, yet caring...you hate to love him/love to hate him! I'm also a fan of True Blood but...there is something about The Originals that has me hooked! :) It is also ""believable"" with the siblings being the original vampires. Each of them are unique in character. Who knows...maybe they used their ""mind compulsion"" on me.... and it worked! I highly recommend watching this series; you won't be disappointed! <3",2013
9,"First three episodes are quite good. Story is fast and balanced. Cahracters are nice also and they have some nice back stories. I only hope that they are keep going strong like in these first few episodes. People who watched VD will still watch VD but its popularity will drop due to The Originals. This is what Ian Somerhalder said about The Originals:""Now, they're going to be taking these characters that mean so much to our show. I'm insanely happy for everyone, but I'm not thrilled. Not that I mind sharing, I just don't want to lose all these amazing actors on our show. Who are the other people who are gonna be coming on the show? Are they gonna be good? Because it's The CW, and everyone has to be pretty, and there aren't a lot of pretty people that can act well."" For now I see few new actors in The Originals that do better job than him.",2013
10,Three episodes in and I am hooked!! It's a great show! Possibly better then the vampire diaries!!!!! And I love the vampire diaries! ,2013
9,"As a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries, I was excited to hear about a spin off the The Original Family. At first I was worried it was going to be a disaster, but was I ever wrong! After watching the first 2 episodes I have to say I am impressed. Love the fact that more time is devoted to our favorite Originals, they really needed their own show. So happy this show exists!!! On a side note, I am watching American Horror Story Coven, A show about young and old witches coming to terms with their powers in modern day New Orleans...same city The Originals live in. It would be really cool to see an overlap of the shows for an episode or 2.... see how Marcus would deal with a Supreme Witch!!!!",2013
10,"Vampire Diaries started to lose its appeal during last seasons and The Original Family didn't suit well in the plot. It felt like there must be more space for their proper development, they needed a separate story line. And finally it happened. So far every character seems to be in the right place and the main issues are rather promising. Klaus is very interesting, many-sided and contradictory personality and Joseph Morgan is an excellent actor who is able to be the star of his own show. Besides, Elijah and Rebekah have their own share of charisma and play an important role in the series. The only weak point may be absence of Caroline as a love interest for Klaus but the possibilities of crossovers can remedy the situation. It is obvious that most of the audience expects this storyline to be continued. Other main characters - charming Marseilles, smart Camille, mysterious Davina, brave Sophie - have a good potential and interesting for further exploring. Many people doubted appropriateness of a baby in the supernatural show like this but I guess writers have some trumps to surprise their viewers.",2013
9,"This series is about the bonds of family and heated power struggles--with a big dose of vampiric hedonism mixed in. Sounds like the makings of something pretty fang-tastic but i must say though the pilot felt a little bland, they repeated the same episode from the vampire diaries but from Elijah's perspective, showing his side of the story and then a shocking end with Klaus daggering his now only beloved brother, but watching the second episode i this the show has really picked off, and will soon become a franchise, i recommend you watch it don't just judge the first episode this a truly a great addition to The Vampire Diaries and so be given a lot of credit .",2013
7,"When I first watched this show I had hoped it was not in anyway shape or form like Vampire Diaries, which wasn't for me. I wasn't disappointed, It's definitely a show for a more mature audience without the high school drama and typical high school valley girl or boy band attitudes or music. Great work! I like it so far. ",2015
10,"I have seen a lot of Serials! But this is AWESOME! 10/10 Never seen anything better Than This and The TVD! The British Accent on Klaus god too Good! Please let this Serial never end! The plot of Serial is very good as Klaus is trying to improve but at the same time he still is mean and evil, and his family moving together and apart but he is progressing i can't wait to see more!! arrrr, I really wanna praize the person who wrote the plot for this, Give Him/Her a medal they defo deserve it by far... I wonder how many season will their be i hope more that 1, hope and that their is going to be a lot more where the 2 episodes have came from! Bless This serial bro!!!! Too good to be real am telling you it's flipping overpowered! It just drags you in and doesn't wanna let you out!",2013
4,"First let me say I am big into Syfy, but indifferent on the whole werewolf/Vamp thing. I initially liked the premise of the Original Vampires, but once I saw they made one stronger and truly immortal, I had the suspicion this would lead to lazy writing like what I witnessed with Silas in Heroes. Need a plot twist, use Silas, good today, evil tomorrow, plot against him, repeat. In my opinion ANY writer who creates a character like this does so as a crutch and uses it to avoid having to write just how does he escape or win? Even Superman wasn't considered immortal and had a weakness and could be killed, but you want me to believe I cut the head off this stupid Vampire and it will grow back? (theoretically) I will say for a TV show the acting and filming is good to excellent, if only the character development was there. I watched 8 episodes but after the lazy writers turned the two characters I liked into sniveling cowards...I hit exit and do not plan on going back.",2016
7,"The Originals plays like a supernatural Dallas set in New Orleans. It's about shifting alliances and power struggles, with frequent but doomed romances thrown into the mix. There be vampires and witches and werewolves duking it out to gain the upper hand. The series starts off with a tension challenge because the three leads, two brothers and their sister, are all Original Vampires – the first ones – and are therefore seriously hard to kill. But the writers are creative enough to find multiple ways of making them suffer. And there are always some recurring characters in the cast who are more vulnerable and at risk of getting offed. The one most at risk is a werewolf who will be giving birth to a miracle-baby, who will be half werewolf and half vampire. A considerable amount of people want her dead.",2015
7,"The Originals is the spin-off of the teen vampire series and take place in New Orleans. It's about the three originals (first vampire) the vicious anti-hero Klaus (Joseph Morgan), his caring brother, Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and their bitchy sister, Rebekah (Claire Holt). The series about Klaus want his home back after his protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis); who is now charge of New Orleans and fighting territory with the witches and also sexual attraction to Klaus's sister Rebekah. The werewolf girl, Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin who was previously guest star on TVD and reunited her mermaid co-star Holt from H20) is now pregnant with Klaus's child that is half werewolf/half vampire and everyone is after the baby been use they see it as threats.",2014
10,"The Originals is much more than some teen supernatural drama. The storyline is extremely compelling and explores an old topic in a new and fresh way. There are no victims in this show, everyone has their own strengths and it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.",2014
9,"The Originals is amazing!! I'm a fan of the Vampire Diaries, and I really liked the pilot. This series is very refreshing! The Vampire Diaries are nowadays not really feeling it with some story lines. I liked Klaus very much in the Vampire Diaries. He is so powerful and on the other hand so vulnerable. He is nice to watch (read: he is very sexy). His brother Elijah and sister Rebekah are very nice characters too. Nice to see the relationships between those three. Besides them, there are plenty of other interesting characters. The series takes place in New Orleans. It's a city that never sleeps, and a perfect place for the series.",2013
6,"I previously gave this show 8 out of 10 but season 2 is just horrible! Its as if there are new writers for the show and they just throw everything plus the kitchen sink in to make up a story. The suspense,romance and great story lines of season 1 is gone and now we are left with this nonsense. Bringing back both evil parents, the witch mom and the aggressive dad could of been a very interesting story line but the way it is playing out is just ridiculous. I am so disappointed and have stopped watching Originals as it is just becoming to painful to watch this hot mess. Perhaps lessen the hundreds of useless cast? Maybe shoot more scenes in daylight? Do they always have to wear black? Davina is the only story line that I still find intriguing and it could be a great story line but we keep switching back from the evil mom to the evil dad and,and,and, and...Too many stories and I cant keep up. Keep it simple and great. Perhaps add some eye candy like in Vampire Diaries? I hope the writers come to their senses before they lose a large amount of their audience as all my friends are also on the brink of dumping this show. Something needs to happen and be fixed. The show has such great potential but at the rate it is going downhill I just don't know....",2014

10,The Originals is beyond doubt one the best supernatural shows on air right now. And it's all due to the following five reasons.,2015
9,"I love spectacular TV-shows with amazing production values like Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, but I have to say: although House of Cards has little interest in jaw-dropping images or gruesome make-up effects, it delivers just as many dark thrills to keep you glued to your seat as the action-heavy flagships of HBO and AMC. It's a testament to the writers', directors' and actors' talents that a show which mostly consists of people talking is as much a prime candidate for binge- watching as the shows I've mentioned before, so for those of you who haven't started watching it yet, be warned: House of Cards is highly addictive.",2015
10,I firmly believe that one of the major aspects of what makes House of Cards so good is the ability to watch all the episodes back-to-back with no commercials or programming schedules to get in the way. This small but hugely significant idea will be an industry game changer and I am certain that this is just the beginning,2013
10,"When I thought about Francis Urquhart of the original House of Cards series, I could not help but imagine Kevin Spacey in a way that was similar but a role of his own making. Spacey's role of Francis Underwood, in Netflix's original series, is nothing short of a tour de force. The convenience of being able to watch the whole season right away is also something to mention as a new, fresh and exciting method of television excellence. No longer do we have to wait and be fed slowly the episodes as we wonder what might happen and find ourselves somewhat disappointed -- now we can be swept away. And that's exactly what will happen to you when you sit down to watch this. 13/10.",2013
5,"I feel the Season 5 was all over the place. The high point being the first episode with Frank's speech to the Congress from where the season went to being dull, confusing and full of plot holes. During the speech which set a tone in the first episode where he says ""I will not yield"", I thought wow, this can only get better from here. ",2017
7,"The 5th House of Cards season didn't convince me like the others. Of course, there was the usual suspense and Claire becoming the new president and Frank being at the mercy of her was an unexpected turning but what I didn't like was the lack of logic.",2017
5,"House of Cards.....I was drawn to this Netflix political drama because of David Fincher and Kevin Spacey. I've loved most of Fincher's work as a director and Spacey was fabulous in the three roles that I've seen him in. The series has some Fincher-esque qualities: the colour palette and grading and fine production standards. In the first season, it even has Fincher's strongest attributes: script and direction. It has spectacular photography, fine editing, good direction, and some great performances by Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Mahershala Ali, Kate Mara, Molly Parker and a few others. What weighs it down is Spacey's constant chitter-chatter with the viewers and the fact that the two main characters are so despicable. There seems to be nothing human about them. Frank is still okay when it comes to his relationship with Claire, but that softness isn't reciprocated. Showtime's 'BILLIONS' also lacks likable characters but they still make it fun because they are up against one another. Here, the viewer is expected to believe that hardly anyone can see through the scheming of the Underwoods and that most politicians are gullible as hell. The writing gets consistently poorer with each season. The first was a 9, the second a 7.5 and the third seems to have taken it lower to 7 in the first two episodes, only to drop it down to a 5 in the third, causing me to ditch the rest of the show. It drops almost like Walker's approval ratings. The series is also way too long. Could've been so much better as a mini-series. Watch it if you have plenty of patience and are willing to be slightly disappointed.",2017
8,"Fans of David Fincher and Kevin Spacey have been eagerly looking forward to House of Cards. Not only is this an opportunity to see an elite Hollywood director and actor take on a new medium, but it represents Netflix's first attempt at original programming (I guess Lilyhammer came first, but House of Cards is a much bigger investment for Netflix). The CEO of Netflix has said that House of Cards is meant to be a show on the quality level of the top cable stations, such as HBO, and the final product delivers on this promise.",2013
2,"I've been watching House of Cards on Netflix since S1-E1. Initially, I thought it was a fantastic show. The first 3 seasons became the go-to watch as soon as they were released. Unfortunately, the photographic techniques and music in the opening credits are about all I truly enjoy anymore. Having watched half way into S5 and reviewed the IMDb synopses, it's obvious nothing is ever resolved in the HoC universe.",2017
9,"Just watched the first episode. It is outstanding in every sense of the word. Fist of all I'd like to say, Kevin Spacey is amazing. He's not the dull politician we're used to seeing, he's a deeply written character with nuances to his actions and speaking. You can definitely see Fincher's style in the first episode, at least. It contains some of the similar themes he has tackled before in his film and adds to those. He crafts the story very tightly woven and complex. Kate Mara is also great, she adds to the list of modern Fincher characters. I love the points of satire in Spacey's character and some of the symbolism used. The show is outstanding in every aspect, unlike a lot of other political dramas on TV, can't wait to watch the next episodes.",2013
3,It's the worst season ever! ,2015
3,"Unexpexted failure all of the 3rd season. Totally based on feelings that never appear before. Surprise how easily one of the best serials become total bullshit. In case of Russian president - OK, no question let him be like this, but sensitivity of main characters and decisions made not based on politics but on human being - its out of question in political world. Very bad, and very upset. Gay scene between president and a writer ?? Oh please. Senator changed mind due to children ? Nightmare. President wife sleeping in a Russian jail(yeah it looks like 3 star hotel) and speaking hours with some delusional idiot who made suicide after ? Looks like an idiot makes scenario. Not sure about waiting for season 4.",2015
10,"I was so looking forward to this, having been a big fan of the original BBC series, with its masterful central performance by Ian Richardson. In fact when I logged in to Netflix (like a lot of people, this show is my sign-up moment), I realised that my expectation level was really high.",2013
4,"In general, i think House of Cards is OK to watch. But, how on earth is it possible that everybody other than Frank and Claire Underwood is as naive as a high school teen? The president's wife asking Claire for marital advice, come on! And then there is Frank and the president, while being in an important meeting, talking about the president's marital problems.",2014
7,"The first 3 seasons were excellent, season 4 was very good but season 5 was way below the previous level. The producers finally 'jumped the shark' in season 5 when Frank pushed the secretary of state Catherine Durant down the stairs in the White House to stop her from testifying against him. Come on ! Serious 5 is very hard going and extremely slow. You end up watching not because of the intense drama but only to see what happens next. Kevin Spacey breaks the fourth wall so often in season 5 he should be in the demolition business. Too much. It is disappointing when a series you think was one of the best descends into a bit of a farce just to milk a few more million dollars.",2017
8,"This show was a compilation of everything I wanted to see (in the limits of what is acceptable on TV). I loved the characters but at a certain points, the series gave in to the popularity. I regret the choices made by the runners. I waited a year to see the fifth season watching and re-watching all the seasons like an addict, I know every-seconds, every character, every conversation, knowing all the stakes and side-story. The release of the fifth season was the most important date in the year for me, and in 24 hours, I came to hate the show. It came back on most of the established ideas. Season 1 and 2= 10/10 Season 3 and 4= 8/10 Season 5= not even 5 (It would have been higher if the previous seasons weren't so great) So great series with a crappy fifth season which ruins everything, in an attempt to make it last. Was it to good to be true ?",2017
6,"After a couple of great season, the show is too boring to watch. ",2017
2,"Netflix has managed to ruin two great shows that I used to love, House of Cards and Orange is the New black. It seems as Netflix shows have gotten very popular lately they have gone into ""safe"" mode and started watering down their content.",2017
3,Every season is the same:,2017
1,I'm gonna keep it really short.,2017
9,"From the start, Kevin Spacey captivates & impresses with his his portrayal as the Machiavellian chief whip. The dialogue is superb, the editing tight, & the plot moves at just the right pace.",2013
3,"First four seasons were amazing! Having said so, am I the only one forcing myself to watch each new episode to the end now? Yes, the acting is impressive, yes it's smart, and sometimes funny, and provoking, and blah-blah-blah... But, despite all its relevant references, it became such a regurgitating bore, I feel like I keep watching it out of complicity. Who arе these Martian characters? All these unbelievable villains straight out of comics? It feels like their target audience is some kind of absurd Zuccotti trailer park / fake news readership ... In the middle of season 7 I deleted it from my queue. Or was is season 6?",2017
3,"And year long wait is over. Season-5 arrives. You are all ready to Binge Watch it, and guess what!! Your expectations are torn apart episode by episode. And by the time you finish the whole season, you say to yourself: Oh! Come on. Was I waiting for this?",2017
2,"We started watching Season 1 and by Episode 6 were disgusted with the main characters. Everyone is just plain stupid except for the two main characters played by Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. You can see every setup a mile away. Yet as noted those who are caught in the cross hairs are portrayed as being complete imbeciles who never see it. And best of all there is NEVER any investigation into anything, apparently the media, law enforcement, and related characters just assume everything is real. In one particular scene, a Secret Service agent, who BTW was also a former trained police officer, was so stupid that he fired his weapon in a residential neighborhood during what was a non-life threatening situation. I thought I only saw stupid thing like this network TV but apparently the same writers are here too. What BS they expect you to believe. It's bad enough to see Kevin Spacey's character, Frank Underwood, as a self-centered ego maniac, but then to add Robin Wright as his power hungry slutty wife who will do anything she needs to for her benefit or Kevin's, it's way too much for those looking for some form of reality. BOTTOM LINE: If you like seeing stupid people up against bad guys who while not overly clever always win, only through the sheer stupidity of those they interact with this show is for one. For those with an IQ over 85 who prefer seeing a plot that is not so obvious, this show is one to avoid.",2015
2,"What happened to series three? Even though the personnel on the masthead were the same, it looks like they turned the writing over to the interns without any kind of editorial or thematic direction. The principal characters have fallen apart. This Frank Underwood appears to be more virtuous and caring than recent presidents Clinton, Bush, or Jarrett. In fact almost any period from their White House tenures would be more eventful, devious, and exciting than the crap we saw in this series. This was a massive disappointment. I get the sense that the actors were as impressed by the writing as I was because it looked like they were phoning in their performances. I'd be amazed if they go for a serious four after this fiasco.",2015
10,"Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled.",2013
10,"It is quite unusual for me to laugh very hard, when I am watching an episode of a show. But with The Goldbergs I was cracking up by the first half of the first episode, I could not resist to write my first review on IMDb.",2013
9,"I have to admit, that when I watched the first episode of this show, it reminded me so much of The Wonder Years that it was distracting. That being said, after episode 2 and 3, I hardly notice the narration. I think the first episode had a ton more narration because of character introductions and such, but 2 and 3 have gotten progressively funnier, and all of the 80's nostalgia is very endearing to me. ",2013
8,"I believe it depends on what type family you grew up with whether you enjoy this program or not; and although my family was not exactly like this, nor did we grow up in the 80s, The Goldbergs is quite charming and each episode has struck a nerve with this viewer and tugged at my heartstrings.",2013
9,"I haven't seen a single commercial for this show, but I recognized the mom from Reno 911 and figured I would give it a shot. It's actually pretty good. Having grown up in suburban Philly in the 80's, they have pretty much nailed a typical Northeast Philly suburb. The writing is good, and the plot is fun to follow. I think you will really enjoy this show if you like smart, funny comedies you can relate to. The clothes are dead on for 1985. The house is exactly like every house I ever went into in our neighborhood, and just as tacky. The family dynamic is very familiar, and accurately represents a typical Philly family. I urge you to give this show a chance. You will more than likely see a lot of your own family in these characters.",2013
9,"This was written at almost the end of the first season. I can't speak for more than that. But so far, It's really, really funny.",2014
8,I came to this show because of Jeff Garlin from Curb.,2013
10,"My husband and I are ""kids of the 80's"" and we freaking love The Goldbergs!! It's great to see the outfits, hear the music, etc... What a great time that was. I can relate to Adam a little, my dad also sat around in his underwear!!! I will admit that we weren't too sure about the show after the first episode, but we decided to keep going and are very happy that we did!! These people hating on the show can easily remedy their problem by CHANGING THE CHANNEL!! I don't get the hateful comments, if you don't like it just say that. You don't have to go postal and just be really nasty. I hope they come back with a 2nd and 3rd season of this show. Adam is my favorite, that kid is too funny! Go Goldbergs!!!",2013
9,"This show is great. Being a child of the 80's, I enjoy all of the references to the 80's such as roller rinks, Ghostbusters, ugly knitted sweaters, windbreakers, and the like.",2013
1,"I love Jeff Garlin. He was brilliant on Curb. He's the reason I wanted to watch this show. I was born in 1976 so I grew up in the 80's. I am the same age as the show's creator, Adam F. Goldberg, and I grew up in Philadelphia. The 80's references they make feel forced throughout the whole show. ""The only one that gets me is Flavor Flav""??? Oh, I get it...because he was around in the 80's. No one in the 80's ever said that. Ever. It seems that every time the writers throw an 80's reference in there it's them reminding you that the show takes place in the 80's. A great example of how to and how not to write a period show would be ""That 70's Show"" & ""That 80's Show"". ""That 70's Show"" was about a group of friends growing up in the 70's. Rarely did a character ever point out the fact it was the 70's. ""That 80's Show"" constantly pointed out 80's things like cell phones the size of bricks and Pac-Man. The same goes for ""The Goldbergs"". They're constantly bringing up 80's references...like REO Speedwagon, Sam Goody & GoBots...and that's just from the pilot. This is a painful show to watch that feels forced most of the time. 3 episodes in and I haven't cracked a smile yet...and I usually laugh at everything. It's so bad that I can't even fathom how anyone with a sense of humor could laugh at it.",2013
2,It hardly resembles the 80s. It is like a bad/trashy version of wonder years. The mother is way too attached to her kids. It is a little weird. The references where not correct in the 80s. That whole scene where the little boy and grandpa was taking about breast and the little boy says he wants to smother his face in them. Absolutely sicken!!! He is like 10. What the heck is wrong with you people and panning a little girl body slowly passing her chest. One word Pedophiles. So it is OK to show little girls as sex objects?! Who see this as OK? This is what we teach our children. TV shows are really going down the drain. I wouldn't watch this crap of you paid me. Please do society a favor and cancel this crap!,2013
10,"We love this show. I can see how there are people who are turned off by this show, though. It takes a certain off beat sense of humor to get it.",2013
5,"There are way to many errors in this show for it to be set in the 1980s. Did the writers even research what they referencing in the show? Two-tone jeans, slap wraps, Hypercolor, and Reebok Pumps all belong to the early 90s. No one knew of Kid N' Play until 1990 when House Party was in Theaters. The writers will ram anything in there just to remind viewers that it was the 1980s. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who caught the Flavor Flav mention in 1985, FOLKS. I'll say that again. ""No one gets me, but Flavor Flav"", said by Barry Goldberg in 1985! I don't ever remember seeing AmToys Madballs in an arcade claw machine. Some episodes are too unrealistic also. Who sees ""Say Anything"" and then holds up a Ghetto Blaster at someone's' house. No one in the 1980s tried such a thing. They were very heavy. I'm think the one Lloyd Dobbler had was a fake set piece. The dining room just isn't what a one in the 1980s would look like. The only objects that seem retro in the entire show are Adam's toys. I cannot think of any child that thought to save the G.I. Joe All American Hero USS Flagg box around. I was alive in the 1980s, as you can tell. My generation usually tossed the boxes after 10 minutes or so. There is no way Adam Goldberg rented ""How Harry Met Sally"" in late '89. In the real 1989, most people were still renting flicks from 1988. So, in that case, ""198x"" would have had to have been 1992. The child actor who plays Adam comes off as too mature for his age. Like Surviving Jack, the writers just cobbled anything together and called it ""That 80s Show"". Heck, ""That 80s Show"" captured the feel of the mid 1980's over this babble. I have this a 5/10 because the adult actors managed to make me bust out a few laughs every now and then, especially Jeff Garlin and George Segal. I'll stick with ""Everybody Hates Chris"" or a film from the 1980s like ""The Princess Bride""(earliest part) over this.",2014
2,"First off, I grew up in the sixties and by no means led a sheltered life. I have also been blessed with the uncanny ability to find something funny about any situation. Maybe it is due to the fact that our family life was earlier but we only thought the show to be ""borderline"" funny,with a whole lot of screaming going on and not a whole lot of comedy. Grandpa seemed to be quite the pervert the way he was describing how to handle the tween girl behind the counter. We all look forward to the new shows that preview in the fall and have a little pool to see which ones will ""make it"". Unfortunately, I have to give this one 5 weeks in our dead show pool. That being said, did anyone have a hard time answering the question ""what's a jag-off?"" to the kids in the room when it was used in reference to the clerk at Sam Goode's? That folks, was a first for me on network PRIMETIME television.",2013
3,"Yes...some others have said it here before that the people who seem to hate this show the most are the ones who grew up in the '80s. I don't have a problem with a show about the '80s, but it has to be ACCURATE and not lazy. The show has to make me feel like I'm really watching something from the '80s..but this show didn't do that at all. I won't knitpick too much as others have already pointed out the flaws, but here's one example. In one episode, they're talking about watching the TV show ""That's Incredible"", which stopped airing in 1984 or so. Then in the next 5 minutes, the grandpa talks to the young boy that he should watch ""How Harry Met Sally"" ....a movie that was released in 1989? Come on....no wonder they keep saying ""19 eighty something""...so, that they can just keep the whole decade open to referencing...but you know, it doesn't work that way. There must be consistency in period shows. Do you think 2001 was the same period as 2009? Of course not. Another reviewer pointed out that the boy says the ""only one who understands him is Flavor Flav""...get out of here. White people didn't know about Flavor Flav until probably after 1989 or 1990 when Public Enemy really started hitting mainstream (""911 is a joke"" was circa 1990). Lazy writing....won't watch it again unless I happen to leave the TV on while I take a nap.",2014
2,I was excited to see some 80 things and sayings but all i saw was a bunch of people yelling at each other. Do the producers think that in 2013 we have become so scared of kids that we don't yell at them? That is not an 80 thing. Pac man is and arcades. I know you probably didn't want to have to pay music records royalties but you need to have some music from the 80's . Oh and the jeep at the end was a new 2000 wrangler. Most shows about the 80 show parents working like 6 jobs and not giving a rip about the kids.,2013
10,"I'm way too late to the party on this show as INot since Home Improvement have I enjoyed a good family sitcom like I have, The Goldbergs. Not just because I'm a child of the 80's and can relate, but because I'm growing tired of big networks trying to shock an audience rather than simply offering to entertain them. Good, honest humor with a great cast and awesome music. Please make more shows like this one.",2017
8,"Despite the fact that I'm not a child of the 80's, having been born in the 90's, I have to say I freaking love this show. The main reason it has quickly become my favorite thing to watch is because of its characters. All of the main Goldberg family are likable and relatable in their own ways and this really helps the show, also in a rarity for these shows, the supporting cast are equally as interesting, I'm a massive Dave Kim fan. I also find that the stories in each episode are great because they are also relatable and have a meaning behind them, it truly captures the heart of growing up in a way that not many shows do and this is a major bonus. I find that its very rare nowadays to find a sitcom that has as much heart as this one, largely due to the fact that they decide to focus on characters like the young bachelor dating a supermodel, but what helps it is the fact that everybody can relate to having a family that annoys them. For me this is one of the best shows on the air and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about watching regardless of age. A fun filled show about a realistic everyday family that has clearly been made with a lot of love.",2017
1,"Awful writing. Pathetic, amateur directing. Talentless ""acting"". Sad, bland set design. Boring costume. All of this is topped by the most random, inconsistent casting in the history of motion picture technology. This random collection of people look as related to one another as the Village People. ",2013
5,"I watched this show a couple of times. I think the actors and writing are quite funny, but the historical inaccuracies just make it unwatchable for me. Did anyone who writes/directs/produces this show actually live through the 80s?",2016
1,"This program screams ""Look at how much I grew up in the 80s!!!"" it is full of ""overtly subtle"" references to the era I was supposed to take place in. It is really disappointing to see so many people that I have respected in the past from the field of comedy (Patton Oswalt, Wendy McLendon-Covey, Jeff Garlin, George Seagal,) have signed on for a completely uninspired and forced show that is way to self aware. Unfortunately someone in the boardroom had the idea to slap together another nostalgia piece that just wasn't needed. We went through 1998- 2010 doing the ""pre/post millennial nostalgia kick"" and it is time to move on. Stations like AMC, FX and the Pay channels have started showing the way of where TV is heading, network keeps pumping out tired old shows and themes again and again. I really can't wait for this thing to be canceled, it is utterly terrible.",2013
1,"I was raised on Family Ties, Growing Pains, Full House and the Wonder Years. Unfortunately as we have (d)evolved over the years so has television degenerated and been dumbed down to entertain an ignorant mass of people.",2013
10,I'm a little surprised that there are any negative comments about the show. It is TV people. A little over the top is what's it all about...poking fun at reality. ,2013
