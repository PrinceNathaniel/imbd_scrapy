1,"I've been watching this since 2010. I LOVE zombie movies. Dawn of The Dead is my favorite. Back in the early 2000 there were several great zombie movies. Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling  suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as ""action"" movie. No one would tell the difference.",2017
5,"This show used to be good, very personal, sometimes a bit melodramatic, but always filled with strong characters and interesting story arcs.",2017
5,"As Season 8 begins, this has gone from 10/10 to 1/10. Terrible. Absolutely terrible. ",2017
3,"Something is wrong with season 8. The walking dead is my favourite TV show but first 4 episodes could be just 1episode or half! Even images/photography and atmosphere look different...its like there is another director or something cheap .Writing is silly and boring...Negan,one of the most interest vilain, they manage to make him seem boring. I don't know maybe they decide to take it really slow but is not good idea. And doesn't look nice also..",2017
1,"They've lost me, the producers have lost me. How many times can they recycle the same plot? This is no longer humanity vs zombies, this is humans vs humans with a unnecessary dose of violence and twisted psyche, all for the sake of maintaining ratings and milking the cash cow. The writers creativity have been depleted for a few seasons now, there has been no direction, no gradual learning, no story development. All the physical moving around is just the illusion of story to mask the fact that there isn't a story being told at all. The show isn't going anywhere. I have stopped watching, and I feel liberated from this burden of a show. TWD has slowly decomposed into a gross, unintelligent TV show. Who keeps making gas, electricity... but then there's no radio communication... What happened to the military, the government, smart people, common sense... I understand the appeal for certain demographics, but I, for once, demand more from entertainment than this garbage, good bye!!!",2016
2,"I suppose it still has a lot of fans, but TWD has become incredibly dull and boring. Some reasons:",2017
1,"This show was my all-time favourite TV show. Seasons 1-3 were great, good plot, they actually had GOOD ACTORS (Merle, Shane, Governor), the zombies were actually a threat (remember when you can get infected by a scratch! Well not anymore!). The show is just so slow-paced with no meaning in any episode. You can skip a couple of episodes in S7 or 8 and not miss out on anything. ",2017
2,"The Walking Dead has reached an all-time low. I can't even express in words how disappointed I am with the season finale. It is without doubt the worst season finale we have seen to-date: absolutely nothing happened, nothing! How on earth did it take Negan 50 minutes to get to Rick's front door?! And, not only did nothing happen, but it rendered the entire season a complete waste of time. Episode after episode, we watched Rick salvage supplies and weapons for this attack; only to see such an anticlimactic ending. It was absolutely pathetic! It's easy to see why the rating for this show are the lowest they have been in five seasons! People are so sick to death of being jerked around, episode after episode... If this is how their first attack against the Saviours was always going to end, it could have happened 5 or 6 episodes into the season. It's so disappointing! I used to love this show. It was once the best show on TV, hands down. What happened? It peaked, and now its slowly dying a horrible and painful death, and destroying its cult following. I wouldn't even give the Walking Dead 3 (out of 10) stars now. It's become so mind numbing boring, it's hurting my head. It's seriously circling the drain. Rick spent half a season preparing for this fight, only to be is betrayed by the Scavengers. The second after it happened, I thought, WTF?! Two steps forward and another ten steps back. This is what this show has become now The season finale could have made up for the entire season, but instead, it was worse than the season itself. And, tell me, what's going to happen in the next episode: Negan is going to walk in again and take all their guns – again – which will put us right back at square one. So did anything happen this season? NO. Could the Walking Dead get any worse? I DON'T THINK SO. Are people losing faith in this show? YES! JUST READ THE REVIEWS ONLINE. Even my girlfriend, who is a hard core fan, tuned out half way through the season finale... The series has become so boring now, it needs to end before it becomes the worst shows on TV. From seasons 2-5, every episode finished on such an amazing cliff-hanger, and you had no recourse but to watch the next and the next and the next, and so on. Now, it's so far beyond redemption, I'm done!! I thought the Walking Dead crashed and burned over 2 seasons ago, but I held in there, hoping against hope, it would make a bounce back but all I have experienced is utter shame and disappointment! My loyalty to the Walking Dead, only stretches so far, and I have reached mine. ",2017
5,I was such a fan of this series. Season 1 with the opening scene from Rick in the hospital and meeting the first zombie. Epic TV!,2017
1,"At the conclusion of the 1st episode of series 8, the enthusiastic TV link lady said ""Well. Wasn't that worth the wait!"". Well. Actually, no it was not. I've done with TWD. No more. Enough! The dream sequences. Eh??? Awful. And how many more golden opportunities to kill Negan are going to present themselves And weren't the combined groups reduced to having a gun and bullet count in series 7. All of a sudden they've got 1000's of rounds to squander. And squander them they did, because they didn't get any of the saviours as far as I could see. Incredibly dumb and dull.",2017
10,"I only recently was talked into watching the first episode by my Daughter as I avoid the Undead, Ghost, Vampire genre. I was blown away! I could not stop watching and had to get EVERY episode! They made 6 episodes year 1 and about 12 year 2, at 42 minutes an episode the entire year 1&2 run time is around 12 hours total and COULD RUN AS ONE 12 HOUR MOVIE, and you would still not wanna leave for popcorn. The end of each episode left me dying for the next one, The writing is incredible, the character development amazing and don't suppose you know who will live or die here cause you will have no idea. The quality makes it seem as if all other series are quaint and boring. I find myself thinking about the next episode every day. VERY WATCHABLE; VERY ENTERTAINING; GREAT GREAT SERIES!!",2012
9,"I quite enjoyed Season 1 of The Walking Dead, then I sat through a boring Season 2, after about 4 episodes of Season 3 I gave up.",2014
7,Lets get this out of the way straight away THIS WILL BLOW PEOPLES SOCKS OFF. Im not kidding. I know people here are attracted to this genre for various different reasons but i'd like to think we all share some connection when zombies are involved. For me its the post apocalyptic scenario. I don't particularly need the gore element but it has its place when used well.,2010
10,"First heard about this show a few weeks back. Since I love zombie-movies I had to see what this was all about. At first glimpse I was a little skeptic, but the trailer convinced me otherwise.",2010
4,"So when I first watched this series I loved it. The first few seasons are amazing, lots of emotion in them, characters were interesting. They have lost all of that in the recent seasons. The cast has grown and continued to grow since then and it makes for a very bland show. ",2017
7,"Well this was one of my favorite TV shows, but not anymore, as this last season has totally pushed the show down the drain. Things started to put me off after seasons 4 and 5 but season 6 is just so repetitive, uninspired and boring.",2016
1,"How to describe the characters and writing of this show. I think 'stupid' or 'idiotic' might cover it. The entire concept of the show, the idea itself is fantastic, unfortunately the writing staff have monologue'd the show into oblivion.",2011
2,"My true rating started with 10, then by season 6 - an 8, then the seasons after...2",2017
5,"I watched the entire season, all the time hoping the next episode was going to be better than the one before. Maybe I was expecting too much when I heard The Shawshank Redemption/Green Mile director Frank Darabont was heavily involved.",2010
2,"This whole season has just been Rick walking around with the thousand yard stare wondering what just happened and letting Negan do whatever he wants and even Negan, as interesting as he is, is getting a little old with the hip thrusting dance. Want all my guns and ammunition that I could have used to take you out? Sure, no problem. Want me to be your slave while you kill anyone you want? Sure, no problem. Every other cast member has stepped up to show at least some defiance. It takes Rick 8 episodes to (maybe) to grow a pair? And he's supposed to be the leader and star of this show? Sorry writers but you need to step up your game because this show is circling the drain.",2016
5,"I don't know why I'm even bothering writing about this complete piece of nonsense. The first season was not very good, but I gave the second 2 shots...they're out. The plot is incredibly stupid.,, as are the characters. No group of people this dumb could possibly last in the land of the dead. They take off in vehicles which have little chance of making it down the road very far and they don't. If they are going to try and use the freeway, they should use ATV vehicles which can go else where also. Considering they are always just finding vehicles and also somehow finding gas, I'll bet Atlanta had better cars...they seem to abound. Then instead of trying to hide in the middle of a freeway, they could get out of the open. So, OK, they're dumb. They're caught. They lose a little girl due to the stupidity of that comic opera sheriff, who insists on wearing that ridiculous hat, as though it confers some sense of order, when there is none. When his son ask if ""Can I go too Dad?"" instead of telling him to stay home and guard the fort, he says ""Sure,"" like they are going on a rabbit hunt... and gets shot. Then the dad gets all weepy and shows he has no more intestinal fortitude than the mom of the lost little girl, who's always moaning. His wife should be sheriff... at least she's got balls. And just how is it that this little house on the Prairie has never been attacked by the Zombies? Narry even a broken window. Ludicrous. But good they still have electricity so they can chill the milk that comes from somewhere, since they don't have any cows. What would HatMan do without his glass of milk and cookies. The whole plot stinks. It is one of the worst shows I've ever seen on TV... and that's saying something. I'm done... writing... and watching this complete waste of time. AMC has produced some great shows including Mad Men, but this is dreck.",2011
1,--- Spoilers ---,2011
1,"the first 2 seasons were awesome , I loved the Show , but now It's just another boring show , only this one is the worst the history knew ,",2014
10,"While watching the pilot episode of The Walking Dead the only word that went through my mind was ""awesome!"".",2010
8,"Not everyone is going to ""approve."" The characters make mistakes, sometimes behave irresponsibly, and are full of self doubt. In other words, this is great storytelling. Even if this show is slow to get its start, I hope the network has the foresight to keep it running, because programming of this emotional and moral complexity is a rarity. ",2010
9,"I actually was very skeptical of this show- at first glance, I didn't see how all these different people were possibly going to mesh with one another on screen (the last time I was this skeptical was seeing the teasers for 30 Rock... that should have been a clue!). After watching the first episode, I was impressed. Granted, there was a lot covered in the pilot, but that's how it is: they have to introduce everybody and what their story lines are in the first 60 minute episode. The ""too much"" feeling will undoubtedly calm down as we get wrapped up in individuals instead of the mass family group.",2010
9,"I wonder why this program hasn't received the Emmy or Golden Globe nominations it deserves. The family members aren't perfect, which is one reason I love this show so much.",2010
10,"As a 50 something with grown children this show is so right on. The episode when they found out Max had a real problem was exactly how it went for my wife and I when we got similar news, and the reaction of the grandfather was also spot on. This show is happy, sad and everything in-between, just like real life. It is so good it will probably be taken off the air so that we can be exposed to more of the trash which makes up a lot of todays TV. I also think the brother and sister interaction is great, they can be mad and blow off steam without it becoming a federal case. The marriages are real as well, with different definitions of a good marriage and whats involved. My favorite part though is the relationship between the aunts and uncles and the kids, you treat your own children one way while watching out for the nieces and nephews. Great stuff",2010
10,"A new show with Peter Krause and Craig T. Nelson in the cast demanded at least a look, though if it weren't for the DVR I might have passed on it since it's on at the same time as the excellent ""The Good Wife"". Fortuitous indeed that I did because it strikes me as pure genius in writing and casting.",2010
10,"Actually, that's not true. This guy seems to turn anything into gold, and he does it with subtle style and class that you just do not see very often. This show is classic Ron Howard. It's very difficult for me to really ""get into"" a new show. Usually takes me several episodes or more. I was hooked on this show from the very first scene. The cast is just incredible. The acting is just as incredible. These actors seem as if they've been doing this show for years. You know how it is. Sometimes they have to ease into it together. Not so here. Or if they ARE easing into it, I can't imagine what's going to happen as the show progresses.",2010
10,"Every Tuesday night, after the conclusion of Parenthood, my wife says to me sentimentally, ""I want to be a Braverman!"" NBC's mildly successful drama, Parenthood, utilizes its larger-than-normal cast (15 recurring characters) to create a realistic atmosphere that explores the deeper realities of being an American family. Each episode beckons the viewer to identify with one branch of the Braverman family tree. Do you see yourself as the successful oldest brother, Adam, who everyone in the family looks to for support and advice? Are you the single mother, Sarah, who is overcoming a failed marriage and the repercussions of the children's absent father? Or maybe you're Julia, the successful lawyer who's climbing her way up the corporate ladder, but all the while wrestling with the cost to her family? Then there's the black sheep Crosby, whose fear of commitment and settling down are challenged by the confident, aspiring mother of his child, Jazmin, whom he has fallen deeply in love with. Or, perhaps, your children are raised and now, as the patriarchs of your family you find yourself in Zeek and Camielle's position of watching your children parent and navigating the complexities of having an adult child (not to mention grandchildren) living with you in your home.",2011
10,The pilot started slow . . . but I stuck with it and now it's one of my FAVORITE shows. I LOVE the characters and I actually watch it twice a week. I know . . . I'm a weirdo. I make my husband watch it. ,2010
9,"It's loosely based on the 1989 film, Parenthood, with Ron Howard and Brian Frazer. They previously tried to make it into series when it first came out. The show has a lot going for it like casting veteran actors and actresses like Lauren Graham who I saw in Guys and Dolls. She plays the unemployed, divorced daughter Sara who returns home with her two teenage children Amber and Drew. Amber's played by Mae Whitman who was great in ""Thief."" Craig T. Nelson and Bonnie Bedelia play the parents and grandparents. They once played husband and wife in a television movie almost 30 years ago. The rest of the cast isn't familiar to me but they're doing a good job. They've changed the family's location from the Midwest to Berkeley, California. I like the Asperger's storyline where the ideal parents must accept and learn to cope with their son, Max, who wears a pirate costume and has unusual habits. The scene where Max's parents must come to terms with his Asperger's Syndrome was memorable. The comedy and drama are mixed together and it's a bit more realistic. I would hope this show does well in it's Tuesday night line-up.",2010
2,"Am I the only one who finds this show painful to watch (and I don't mean that as a good thing)? Every single character is obstreperous, shrill, unpleasant, humorless, and emotionally bereft. This family, the Bravermans, seem expert at turning lemonade back into lemons. They're all tightly wound, jittery, lugubrious sourpusses, who persist in talking over each other so that every conversation rapidly escalates in stridency until it ends in a shouting match. The dialogue is like fingernails on a blackboard. Where do they live? Pasadena? What, do they caffeinate the drinking water out there? And that kid Max. Enough with the acting out already! He makes you want to give him a good swat upside the head. If the intent of his character is to promote understanding and acceptance of the developmentally challenged, they (the writers) are failing miserably.",2011
2,"Every single episode has yelling and screaming cross talking and just plain conflict, it's actually quite nerve racking! I thought this show would have been pretty good but season after season of cast members screaming at each other has lost my interest. Trying to listen to the over talking all the time can't make a successful show. I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this non stop fighting. I feel the show could be so much better if there wasn't constant yelling. Especially several cast members yelling at the same time. I followed one of the actors over from six feet under thinking it would be worth watching but I am considering trying to find something with more substance to watch.",2013
10,"The other reviewer (RobNels2000) needs to do his homework. ""Parenthood"" was originally conceived as a TV series, became a movie and then became a TV series! The 1990 series (Ed Begley Jr., Jayne Atkinson, William Windom, etc.) didn't work despite having some great talent behind it (Ron Howard and Brian Grazer plus at least five others credited as executive producers). Now it's back...new cast, same situations. Three generations and lots of subplots. A truly great ensemble (Craig T. Nelson and Bonnie Bedelia, Peter Krause and Lauren Graham, etc.). Many people are going to compare this to ""Modern Family"" but ""Parenthood"" was around first...as a movie and TV series. Lauren Graham is doing very well stepping in for Maura Tierney...she got her training on Gilmore Girls. Craig Nelson, having been an military pilot, football coach and police chief, now gets to play a tough dad/granddad (although my dad could've given him some lessons). The venerable Bonnie Bedelia (many movies and TV series) has aged well to play the mom/grandmom. Add in Peter Krause (""Sports Night,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and "" Dirty Sexy Money"") and there's four solid actors right up front. The big difference between ""Parenthood"" and ""Modern Family"" is that ""Parenthood"" is more drama than comedy. Ironically, I've never been a parent myself but grew up with parents similar to Mr. Nelson and Ms. Bedelia. Let's give this series a few weeks and see where it goes. One suggestion...if and when Maura Tierney gets better, bring her on in a guest role as another daughter. I gave this a 10 for the ensemble and the plot lines!! NBC can go home again!!",2010
1,"I have been a member of IMDb for about 14-15 years. I almost never write a review/comment about a movie or a show. My wife enjoys watching this program and I might enjoy it too if it were not for a couple of things. The music. Stupid folk songs apparently are meant to bring some sort of emotional response to make the viewer feel better about the show or something. It brings an emotional response to me. I have to bite my tongue to avoid screaming at the TV to cut the silly music so that I do not interrupt my wife's enjoyment of the show. Shaky cam. Too many shows use it and this one seems to use it quite a bit. Shaky cam does not make the show edgy or more real. It make the show more annoying on top of the silly folk music. I also find shaky cam to be a substitute for creativity and imagination from the makers of the show. God, the show is on now, Craig T. Nelson is talking, and there is some dumb guitar music in the background. Aaarrrggghhhh.",2012
2,"Not sure where some of the reviewers live, but I don't think I've ever witnessed such a gathering of neurotics/whiners in all my life or in all of the many places I have lived. No one is ever satisfied when receiving a response to their question...they have to press for something that will satisfy them. Why, why, why is the most used word. Good grief, get over oneself and let life continue! If I were in such a family, I'd file for divorce from the lot!!! I truly like the actors individually, but as a group...I had to stop watching, as it's almost as nerve-wracking as the prevalent mattress-hopping on other series. The day to day situations DO reflect a lot of what transpires in many families. Our house had a widowed Mom and children ranging from 4 days to 4 years. Talk about crazy! I wish I had kept a journal, as it would have been quite the tale. Thinking on it, many would probably question the writer's grasp of reality. The lyrics were dead on when they said, ""If you could read my mind, what a tale my thoughts would tell.""",2012
2,I started watching this show because of Lauren Graham. I'm a big fan of Gilmore Girls. But unfortunately I'm totally disappointed! Lauren is charming and funny but what the actress they have chosen for her daughter's character! It's like Beauty and the Beast! It shows in everything - from Abmer's features of character to the way she looks. She is ugly and always depressed! Even when she smiles it seems like she's having nausea...,2013
5,"I used to really enjoy this show and the Braverman family. I felt they were relatable, not perfect, but a classy & casual west coast family. As of late, I can't stand this show and find my self wanting to tell the new character, Hank, to run from the unhinged Sarah and her cursed family. This show tries too hard to tackle too many social issues in an hour each week; teen pregnancy, autism, breast cancer, aging parents, suicide, post traumatic stress disorder & veterans, chemical dependency, mid life dating, infertility, adopting an older child, infidelity, unemployment, demanding wives, intrusive mother in laws ........ It just does not stop and has gone into overload. Why doesn't the show focus more on the cool recording studio and it's potential for interesting story lines? This show has turned too heavy ant this family has gone from being ""brave"" to just perpetual victims and a somber bad luck bunch. Thank God Cougar Town started last week on TBS at the same time slot. I want some good times and laughs.",2013
2,"Initially, I enjoyed this show. I looked forward to watching each week as the family dynamics unfolded. Because it airs at 10 p.m. I found that it was a show that I could watch to unwind and settle down for the night. I watched faithfully for the first season. While I admired the acting skills of most of the cast of characters involved, I began to lose interest as the twists and turns of the storyline became less and less plausible. More recently, I have repeatedly tried to watch episodes and inevitably must turn the channel because of the manner in which the characters now interact with each other. I am not able to tolerate the constant yelling and the way 2 or 3 people will talk at the same time. If this happened in my own home....I would leave! And so, even though I want to watch.....I find I must leave the channel!",2012
7,"Alright, everybody seems a bit... I should I say, immature?... At the very least, lacking wisdom, especially the older generations. Everything is reactions, taking things personally, overly emotional, lacking detachment, and on and on and on. Is it just me, or is Sarah Braverman so annoying with her insecurities, sense of priorities and controlling behavior... Alright, I just thought I'd drop a note on IMDb to appeal to the writers to write about wiser, less neurotic people that have a bit more poise and wisdom after sue life experience and not overreact and worry or freak out all the time like they do...",2011
1,I have really tried to give this show a fair look. There are many shows I watch with my wife and it is rare I cannot find redeeming qualities making it work.,2014
3,If you're into a show where every second is a nuclear crisis times ebola raised to the power of Lorelei Gilmore squared then is the show for you. Everything is a fight and because all the characters are histrionic narciscists who live to lie to each other screaming and talking talking talking talking talking there's never a dull moment. It's an odd dynamic where everyone is more concerned with other people's family than there own there's always that TV busybody cliché that involves spying on one another and the hilarious hijinks that ensue. And if you love characters who are passive aggressive Gilmore clones replete with learned helplessness and an emotional age of 13 you'll love this.,2014
10,"At first as with other shows,(for example The Office) I thought this show was boring. But boy was I wrong :) You will laugh and cry. There wont be a dry eye in your house. There is romance, comedy,action and drama. This show is such a family show. It is optimistic, loving and motivating. It makes you want to be a part of this family. The characters go through things that everyday families would go through. I love the cast, the writing, locations and scenes. This show makes you feel proud and happy to have a family and be a part of it. After the first episode, I was hooked ! I couldn't wait unit the next and the next and the next :) I look forward to seeing Season 5 !!!!!",2013
10,"Parenthood is a great view point of the modern family committed to doing life together. Everything is not perfect, but they stick together. This series is not shy about tackling touch issues. Each episode is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Kleenex's should be kept near by. ",2013
9,"Every episode opens your mind and touches your heart. I am so thankful for this show. It really reminds you that no matter how bad your family can be, you can get through anything no matter how big or small the family or the problem. I laugh out loud and ball my eyes out at the same time nearly every episode. Parenthood hits the spot! From a member of the family who has a disability, drug problem, homelessness, rebellion, loss, love, and/or a little bit of everything else. Even the music they choose is beautiful and so right for the script. Parenthood has yet to let me down and I hope it stays around for a very long time. It's the perfect show for anyone. I love, love, love it!",2013
8,"I surprise myself, never thought I would review this kind of show. Not that it was ever bad, it just seemed like a run of the mill good quality TV-series that didn't need my input.",2011
10,"This show is loaded with excellent acting and writing!!!!! It's worth watching every minute and shot. Steve Buscemi definitely deserves an Emmy for his portrayal of ""Nucky."" I haven't enjoyed a show from HBO this much since ""Deadwood."" The characters are well layered and the dialogue is fantastic. The supporting cast is immensely talented and the scenery is simply gorgeous. Michael Pitt is a pleasure to watch in his, complex role of the war hero gone bad. I hope this show lasts a lot longer than ""Deadwood"" did and makes household names out of its cast. I'll keep my HBO subscription forever if more shows like these are on the horizon.",2010
9,"With production values that are mind-boggling, cast, and a budget to die for HBO is now what film studios were in the 1930s, they have the clout and the ability to go way further than most films can - and you get episode after episode.",2010
10,"The show doesn't need any introduction and neither does the cast. It encompasses a generation where the political landscape is much the same as today but it is laced with more violence, sexism and corruption and in the midst is a thriving business of illegal alcohol.",2010
9,Greetings from Lithuania.,2010
10,"I am not a big TV lover. Mostly I watch South Park, but this show has gotten me interested in more live-action shows. It tells its stories with the same quality as a normal theater film for each episode making it feel like a massive crime drama experience. I have been waiting for a while now to review it, and now that the first season is over I can make my honest opinion clear. I live on a barrier island in New Jersey named Long Beach Island. It is about an hour drive away from Atlantic City so as you can guess I've been there a few times. My favorite part about Atlantic City is the boardwalk. Since this show is named Boardwalk Empire it should do a good job at showing what it looked like back in the 20's. Simply put it captures the 20's perfectly. The show is directed so well I felt like I was transported back to those days. They also capture the feel of the 20's in other ways by showing historic events such as the World Series scam. In the end though it best captures the spirit of the 20's on the boardwalk. As for the plot it is set in the 1920's. Prohabition has begun starting a whole decade of illegal alcohol smuggling. The Treasurer of Atlantic City Nucky Thompson is starting a smuggling business that results in some bloody consequences. Along the way he meets a woman named Mrs. Schroeder, deals with an oncoming election, and more. It is a very well told story. It manages to tell several different stories throughout the show, but none of them feel underdone. They all are extremely well put together story lines. You have the main alcohol smuggling story, the story of Nucky and Margaret, the story of Jimmy, the story of Capone, the story of Lucky, the story of Eli Thompson, the story of Agent Nelson Van Alden, and many more. All these different stories keep things fresh. The emotions that are shown in the episodes are powerful. As the episodes go on emotions get stronger like layers of an onion. Something that is also present in this show is flare. Every gangster flick needs that style to it. It needs to have that gangster feel. While this show doesn't have a lot of that when it happens it is really cool. Now I end this review on the acting. Everybody does a swell job. Buscemi is great as usual, and everyone else is great. The person who I'm most interested in is Michael Pitt who is a relatively unknown actor, but here is great and I would like to see him other things. He could make it real big. Overall I love this show. I will be a viewer of the next season for sure.",2010
10,"A couple of days a go, I saw the pilot of Boardwalk Empire, directed by Maestro Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, one of the main writers of the Sopranos. This is by far the best pilot I've ever seen. Impeccably directed; pure Scorsese, brilliantly written, perfectly casted, amazingly acted and just visually stunning! The look Mr. Scorsese established for the show is a joy to watch and hopefully the other directors will be able to emulate it, but I guess since we have Tim Van Patten, Allen Coulter and Alan Taylor directing most of the episodes, we're safe! From the first episode, Boardwalk Empire shows a great promise. It's about time Steve Buscemi got a leading role, a fine actor and a show stealer, and he's nothing short of great here, with a great supporting show to carry the show with him.",2010
10,"When I watched this it kept me to the edge of my seat waiting to know what will happen next and when. The music with the movie is just like drinking a beer and feeling your first buzz It plays at the right time. The historically reality is just stunning, The silent movies the comedy play mixed with the raids from the feds. It shows how many people were actually poor in certain types of town with low pay. How men who drink beat their wives I did not enjoy watching that though that got me kind of mad at the guy and wanted to see him dead in the show because he killed a unborn child buy beating the mother of it,and Martin Scorsese roll in it. A big $50 million just for the pilot their investing a lot into this show. I enjoyed all the way through even the credits.One of the best pilots I have ever seen.",2010
9,"HBO has once again done it, they are simply the best at putting out provocative, and compelling interesting original series and this time period piece drama ""Boardwalk Empire"" is clearly a big knockout winner. It's filled with enough drama, intrigue, suspense and complex emotions to make a viewer hooked and addicted to me it's like an early version of ""The Sopranos"" as producer and creator Terence Winter does a crafty and great job with this new work just the way he did when he wrote for ""The Sopranos"".",2010
9,"Boasting only a pilot episode (for now), Boardwalk Empire proved to be highly entertaining, at least for me. I never once thought it was slow, although if I recall correctly, the premiere lasted for more than an hour, and I didn't think it was overstuffed or overly dramatic, as many have taken the time to notice. Well, okay, maybe it was a little high-strung towards the end, but it managed to restrain itself nicely on that account. I mean, it could've been much worse.",2010
10,"This is a fantastic series; its the kind of outstanding, must-see programming that drives new subscribers to HBO. The series has superb production values and masterful direction by Scorsese. The acting is first-rate all around, especially the portrayal of Rothstein.",2010
10,And they teamed up with Scorsese and Buscemi.,2010
5,"since first episode it was pretty much what i expected; great re-enactments of 1920's America (including the excessive use of stereotypes unfortunately, with a superficial originality ), an appropriate soundtrack for the era, excellent camera direction, and decent to good actors (a few played too over the top such as Capone character ).",2012
1,"A stinker. An immaculately crafted stinker but a stinker all the same. People talk about the period detail and historical accuracy as if that equals good TV. For those of you that didn't know, this isn't a documentary or a recreation. Boardwalk Empire is a work of fiction. Those irrelevancies aren't what makes me dislike this show though. Although it is amusing that a series which puts such a high value on realism contains such unrealistic violence and melodrama. My problem is that the storyline is mind numbingly slow paced and dull. Hardly anything happens and when it finally does it carries little to no impact because I have been bored into a waking sleep waiting for it to happen. ",2012
3,Into Episode 3 of Season 3 and I just really don't care anymore. Too many incidental characters and story lines are spoiling the broth.,2012
8,"I'm always amazed when some people like things I find really lame and visa versa. Well, Broadway Empire aka ""Jersey shore circa 1920"" is my latest example of the visa versa thing. For me, this period piece is close to perfect. Steve Buscemi in the role of the sympathetic gangster Nucky Thompson is the perfect foil to weave a number of characters and plot lines around. The writing was tight and the casting represented a rich mix which has always been a hallmark of any drama worth it's salt based in The Garden State.",2010
4,I just finished watching the seventh episode of this series and it'll probably be my last.,2010
3,"After six episodes, I give in. ",2011
8,"i first read about this series going into production about 4 years ago. at the time, there was little mention of how central prohibition is to the narrative of the series. if i knew more about history, i might have made that connection right away. but i didn't, and i'm sure that i am not alone.",2010
7,"We have been told to brace ourselves for a certified television masterpiece, to be mentioned in the same breath as The Sopranos and The Wire. I admire the PR work behind this one, but having already seen the entire season, I am more than reserved about the hyperbolic praise pouring on Boardwalk Empire.",2011
9,Excellent film depicting the Atlantic City area during the beginning of Prohibition in 1920.,2010
3,"The Untouchables smokes this slow moving, poorly acted tripe. I was anticipating something a lot better for $50 million. Don't get me wrong, it was all shiny and polished up with a coat of paint. But it's got nothing to show. First of all, Buschemi is NO LEADING MAN. I love his previous roles, but he can't carry this dinosaur. All of the other characters have no depth whatsoever. Is his butler comic relief? More like a stupid cartoon character. Don't even mention Sopranos in the same breath as this blunder. It was a refreshing take on an overworked subject, that really allowed the viewer to pick a character to empathize with and thus truly enjoy ""the ride"". All I saw was Nucky answer the phone, look upset, get dressed and go to the scene to solve the problem. It happens over and over.YAWN!!! It does make you wish for a drink though, just to numb the boredom.",2010
10,"Let me be clear, I despise police or detective shows. It just doesn't do it for me. They throw in a new criminal each episode to fill up most of the time and add a little bit of main story progression at the very end of the episode, leaving it to the season finale to wrap things up in ONE good episode.",2010
10,"What's remarkable about ""Luther"" is how series creator Neil Cross takes a rag-tag bag of clichés--brilliant but damaged rogue cop, long-suffering boss, genius killer, etc.--and makes it all seem so fresh. Of course, having the fantastic Idris Elba helps immeasurably. He doesn't just act the part of Luther; he is Luther, fully inhabiting the role and moving like a force of nature through every scene. This is one of those rare times where you see an actor's innate intelligence and physicality used perfectly. (Watching Luther decompensate, as he does at various times over the story arc, is really something to see.) Elba is matched every step of the way by Ruth Wilson, playing a sort of female Hannibal Lector--brilliant, amoral, remorseless, scary, and, I daresay, sexy. She and Elba make quite a pair, and their interplay is priceless.",2010
10,"Bias, it's a terrible thing I know but I have to admit I AM biased,biased against police drama's, for me they signify the apathy and mediocrity at the heart of British and American television. ",2010
10,"I have watched countless TV shows from the US and the UK and this is by far one of the better written shows. It is not fully packed of twists and turns but the actor who plays 'Alice' is pure evil genius. She alone takes the show from being 'just good' to fantastic! Overall it is worth watching and much better than any other police show I have found in recent years, with a possible exception of 'Dexter' (US TV show).",2010
10,"Okay, it's been a while since i actually saw a series I liked so much. England doesn't churn out amazing movies or TV programmes by the dozen, but when they get 'em right, they get 'em perfect. And Luther is one of those gems.",2010
10,"When i heard that Idris Elba was doing a BBC series i almost hoped it would be a one season-er, but i have to admit this is probably the most enjoyable BBC series in years. Finally a show that relates to the real life of a copper instead of the stupid mistakes we always can identify on shows like CSI, sorry David Caruso but you cannot act for a toffee, not even a bland one. One thing that makes this show so unique is its reality, not all of the episode is committed to the case and its interests, some how it still makes time to experience the personal problems of a copper with people breathing down his neck 24/7. All in all i take my hat off to this show and hail for some more episodes in the near future!!!",2010
10,"Now I love detective series, and tuned in to Luther expecting something interesting. And did I get that? Yes I did and even more than that. It mayn't be the best programme ever, but over the past six weeks or so it was one of the better programmes airing.",2010
9,"""Luther"" the new BBC detective series lead by Idris Elba as DCI John Luther, is a riveting watch. This character, Luther, is a loose cannon primed to fire at will or by wonder, yet this detective's intelligence and focus seems to keep him charging in the right direction. He and fellow officers appear to work on a rather intuitive level and their ability to relate to us 'common folk' and our reaction to injustice, is a magnetizing factor. ",2010
3,"Since I've already watched The Bridge, Happy Valley, and Broadchurch, and The Night Of is almost over, I needed a fix. I saw the reviews of Luther and thought I had found it. Luther is ludicrous, though. It's like the old Batman series (with the""pows"" and ""zooms"" included)meets those terrible NCI shows. Ludicrous plots, ludicrous characters, and virtually no development of the crime. Luther just figures it out, all in his head, and then tells us, wham, bam, thank you ma'am. The back story (that he had some sort of meltdown and was put on leave, but now he's back) is undeveloped, generic. His anger is over the top, and also not developed. I do not understand this character at all. He seems like a hodgepodge of standard cop characters. I want to care about him, I want to see a real person with a unique set of issues. I want to understand why he is broken. But the writers just don't bother. Luther is a comic book character. If he could climb buildings or fly, this series would be more believable. I am a little stunned that so many people love this show. It presents itself as a realistic drama, but in reality it's a melodrama, maybe even a comedy. It's overacted, illogical, and insulting to my intelligence.",2016
9,wow! this is the most entertaining detective show I've ever watched! if you like gritty detective dramas with cleverly pieced together plots then.... watch something else. This series has outlandish criminals doing their thing while Luther magically appears with all the answers and at the same time insults your intelligence.,2010
6,"I started this series for 2 reasons: BBC and Indira Verma; and they both have disappointed. While there was very little of Indira, the show itself was a shallow lake, offering no introspect. ",2013
3,"Yes the cinematography is good. Yes Idris is a hottie (or so I'm told). But other than this, this 'show' is just ridiculous. I'm not even averse to silly plots, for I enjoy the odd episode of Midsummer Murders, but this just takes the biscuit.",2013
5,"I see the high rating here for this series and quite a lot of fuss was kicked up in anticipation of the third series just started on BBC1, so I thought I'd go back and see what it was all about. Well, I'm puzzled actually. Idris Elba plays John Luther, the epitome of the maverick cop who seems to have hired his persona from any number of tough American prototypes, certainly he seems nothing like any British cop you'd ever imagine on the job. And of course he has troubles, including a ferocious temper, a disregard for authority or playing by the rules and naturally problems with his marriage. Ahh, but of course he's a brilliantly instinctive deductive cop, a lone wolf only happy apparently when he's pitting his wits against some devious serial-killer, cavalierly putting himself and his wife into danger to ensnare his prey. This first episode kicked off with a gruesome family murder, including the pet dog, with Luther naturally identifying the very obvious killer within seconds of his first interview with the suspect. It only gets more improbable from there as he engages in a treacherous game of cat and mouse with the murderer before of course his hunches are vindicated and he triumphs in the end. All I really saw here was cliché, exaggeration and unreality. Sly Stallone could have played the lead role, so cartoonish was his character. There was little or no humour at play either which worries me as it makes me suspect the producers perhaps think this is a gritty police procedural. As for the acting, again like the rest of the production, this too seemed over-zealous and unconvincing. I will watch the follow-up episodes although my interest has dimmed to curiosity but something (things) will have to change significantly if I'm to catch up with the new series just airing.",2013
10,"Nothing is perfect, of course, but, for interesting characters and good plot development, I have to say this is an excellent series.",2010
9,"Elba as DCI John Luther is what makes this click. He's awesome as a highly intelligent dynamic loose cannon who is on the verge of being what Dexter Morgan is to the Miami Metro. With a little help from a former suspect; Alice Morgan (hehe) who slipped in and out of an unresolvable murder case, he unwillingly gets out of very sticky situations.",2010
8,"OK, ***spoiler*** Cutting to the chase, - Episode 1- somewhat psychic cop with psychological deficiencies, knows psychopathic girl murdered her parents and ingeniously disposed of the murder weapon but cannot prov it. They are palled up by the end of the series, her having performed some kind of bizarre counselling with regard to his marriage... Doesn't sound too promising in black and white does it? ",2010
3,"I've put off watching this since seeing the first two episodes of series 1 and I must say, I am still astounded. It is one of the most ridiculous, clichéd programmes I have seen in a long while. I still can't fathom which is more wooden, the dialogue, the acting or the story lines. How this has received awards and glowing reviews is truly beyond me. It is just plain bad, on so many levels. ",2013
5,"Series 1 started off great with first four episode based plots being well put together and told with only the the lingering annoyance of the nemesis astrophysicist murderer that got away muddying what is otherwise a great show. Perhaps I'm getting a bit cynical as I get older but overuse of the keeping secrets causing bad situations story line just got tiresome after its use went into double figures. The final straw for me was when episode 5 crashed and burned, with stupid characters and plot twists that were too contrived to be believable... breaking the chain of evidence on one case to prove another being just one in a string of moronic plot artefacts... with the shooting at the end making me laugh out loud it was so ridiculous, never mind the aftermath set-up of course resulted in the hero being blamed for the murder... simply a reworking of many an over done detective show with no originality. Production was good and the acting was rock solid but the descent into absurdity of episode 5 just put me off watching episode 6 or the other two series in the box set.",2015
4,After three seasons and amidst rumors about a feature film it is the right time to summarize the impressions about Luther.,2014
1,"Since I'm a sucker for British productions, I was misled by the ratings and tried to watch the series. I really liked the play of Elba, the settings are in London which is my favorite metropolis and the direction is actually at Hollywood level. So, why the heck didn't they pay attention to the script. - I really find it very hard to believe that police officers don't carry handguns in Britain. Even if that is true, they made it look too easy for a maniac to kill a group of policemen throughout the second episode, until Luther Almighty disarmed him with plain reason. - In episode 3, the unarmed police officer policy reach to another level, when the serial- satanic killer surrenders to unarmed Luther, after confronting him with... arguments. - and finally, in episode 5, my last, he goes to arrest the kidnapper/multiple murderer with a holy bible. He succeeds of course, but doesn't bring the suspect in, because his trusted long time friend/colleague kills the suspect from point blank, fails to hit Luther from 2 feet away, escapes the crowded hotel without being caught on any cameras or seen by any witness, continue to kill people (like Luther's wife) and manages to incriminate somehow Luther, with every disregard to other evidence such as call records. Well, that was the last episode for me, because I totally lost interest.",2014
6,"I was excited to watch Luther, without any expectation I was just curious to see what it would be like. I am a fan of Elba by the way. ",2015
7,I love watching shows where black actors are in lead roles and was excited when I came across Luther on Netflix. Luther is your typical bad detective/cop show; the genius detective whose able to always be one step ahead of the criminals. ,2016
5,"Just watching the last episode of the third season. What utter nonsense. Once again John is the bad guy all real evidence to the contrary. He's killing his friends, trying to kill his girlfriend is the anti-Christ or whatever. The ""good guys""are going to protect the world from John. While the really bad guys keep killing innocent people. And has Luther ever once got there in time to save anyone? He's suppose to be the genius cop with anger issues? The anger issues seem to be the only thing he's got. And cops going after guys with guns without anything but an overcoat and going to try to talk them into surrendering. If that's what is really happening in England I don't give them much credit for having brains. I have a real problem with a show that makes me root for a psycho like Alice Morgan. But in some ways she's much more the genius than Luther. Oh goodie, another scene where we don't listen to Luther. Probably will serve them right whatever happens. Where's Kimmy Schmidt when you need her?",2016
5,"I was disappointed with this detective series (season 1). Some of the episodes were not bad, the fourth episode with the taxi driver being the best. I got very tired and bored with Luther's on again/off again relationship with his wife, Zoe. This just detracted from the main plot. This relationship became repetitive and degenerated into this relationship angst. Every time Zoe came on the screen the fast forward was hit. The last episode was lame and overstated. I also became tired of Luther's repeated temper tantrums. I found it incredible that a detective was carrying on this vicarious friendship with the suspect from the first episode. Whatever happened to trying to solve that first episode anyway? So many unanswered questions and so many airy loop-holes.",2013
10,"My wife and I received a recommendation from friends who pretty much know our movie taste, but I was skeptical. The whole idea of a modern day ""cowboy"" in Kentucky strained credulity, at least on the surface.",2012
10,It's been quite awhile since my husband and I have found a show we both immediately liked -- but we both loved Justified immediately! The dialogue is fantastic! I love the back and forth between all of the characters. The history between the characters is rich and full of drama and leaves you guessing. ,2010
9,"This is the most refreshing show I have found in a long time. When so much on TV falls into one box or another, Justified makes its own way. ",2012
10,"I rarely watch TV, but being such an Elmore Leonard fan I had to see if Justified lived up to Leonard's books. This series appears to be based upon Riding the Rap. Episode 2 actually uses dialog that is taken straight from the book, so I assume Leonard is consulting on this project. The series, at least the first two episodes, captures the wacky but gritty Elmore Leonard style that I love. I disagree about the slowness of pace. I think the series is paced correctly for maximum benefit. Given the cramped style of a 40 or so minute format, I am surprised that they are able to pack in as much as they do. My guess is that the series will be one long exposition of the book, which is fine with me since I am always sorry when I come to the end of an Elmore Leonard novel. If the script and the visual effects didn't capture my mental image of Leonard's novels, then I would not watch.. But the writers, directors and in particular the actors...all of them...have nailed Elmore Leonard. This is far better than Get Shorty. It has the grittiness and the fidelity missing in that movie. I would not be surprised if this series won an Emmy.",2010
9,"I was a bit skeptical about this show based on a couple of the previews that I saw (I am so over the Matrix/300/Spartacus slow motion fight scenes), but I liked Tim Olyphant on season 2 of Damages so I thought I would give it a try. I really liked the first episode. Raylen Givins is a complete bad a**! It is well written and had several great lines that made me pause and rewind. The secondary characters were also interesting. I especially liked Raylen childhood friend turned Neo-Nazi, Boyd. I hope that each episode uncovers more about Raylen and what makes him tick. Give Justified a watch and you won't be disappointed.",2010
10,"A co-worker and I are fans of FX's Sons of Anarchy. He told me about this show after seeing it advertised and urged me to record it. I'm glad I did. I found the premiere episode refreshingly intelligent, subtlety comedic, and engaging.",2010
10,"I was very impressed with the show. Excellent casting choices and the characters interaction is fun to watch. Raylan gives law enforcement a good name. He's humble, honest, sexy and a force to be reckoned with, what a combination! The episodes are fresh and well written. Tim is perfect in this role which showcases his acting abilities perfectly. Looking forward to many more seasons of this fine show. Absolutely love the setting and premise being more of a small town feel. I will definitely buy this series when it comes out on DVD. I have recommended this show to family and friends. Kudos to Tim and all involved in the making of Justified. Just what TV viewers needed a thoughtful and smart series thats well worth watching.",2010
9,"Both my husband and I really enjoyed ""Justified"" we just happened on it by chance.The characters are really good and the underlying humour is fantastic. It reminds us of old Clint Eastwood cowboy movies Good man sorting out the baddies but not a saint. Loved the transporting of the prisoner in the 2nd episode! Not so keen on his hangdog relationship with ex wife but as that is only a tiny part so far can get over it. We like his colleagues the laid back way they go about their jobs, ""do you want me to wing him or kill him?"" This is how TV shows should be, entertaining, this one is marked on the Calendar so as not to miss it. I have not come across Timothy Olyphant before and if this is typical of his talent I will look out for him.",2010
9,"Justified is another fine entry into FX's stable of shows. As a fan of both crime fiction & serialized television, this has been on my radar for some time. First, the story is wonderfully structured & grounded in reality (It helps when you shoot on location & cast actors that actually feel like they belong there) The U.S. Marshalls & their multiple duties have always been a great source for story-telling, and this is no different. Second, the cast is perfect for this type of slow-burn law enforcement story. Timothy Olyphant once again nails the 'cowboy' role we've seen him in before(Deadwood, The Crazies). He runs the risk of being type-cast; but if he's always this good in these types of roles, who cares? The rest of the cast is rounded-out by some familiar & not-so-familiar faces, and the whole of them seem to bring their A-game to this project. The third reason this show is quality is the production value. Everything from the costumes(I love the cowboy hat) to the locations & the music have all been perfectly fitting with the story & the characters. This show also sneaks up on you a little bit, once you think Justified isn't 'edgy' enough for FX, something happens to change your mind. It's only similar to the other FX crime shows in that it centers around a really angry guy. I hope Justified & FX continue to pleasantly surprise me.",2010
10,"Positively one of the best TV shows I've seen in years. I, for one, didn't cared as much about gun action( which by they way is abundant) as I did for the excellent dialogue and the acting. Acting in particular is extremely good, not one single character is out of his role, to be truthful even a dog if you see in a scene in this series, you get the feeling that it's exactly where that dog belongs to. As for the dialogue, it is so good, that it's actually the only flaw this show has. It seems very unlikely that all that crowd of cunning rednecks have such a large arsenal of polite irony, well placed quotes, to the border of well educated people and yet fall over and over to next man's scheme or simply go down by the hand of their own stupidity. Anyways I cannot up-vote this show enough and I can only suggest to make yourselves comfortable in any greasy sofa you have, and prepare to get ported to Harlan, Kentucky.",2015
8,"I just finished the whole series and I enjoyed every single one of the episodes from all seasons. This is an underrated series that deserves much more people to know about it. I'm normally not a big fan of Kentucky accent but in this show it's just great. The conversations between the actors are also excellent. I just love the way they talk in Justified. The actors are all top notch, can't really fail anybody on this show. Walton Goggins (as Boyd Crowder) and Timothy Olyphant (as Raylan Givens)are definitely the two actors that carry this series to a higher level. Their eternal battle against each other is a pleasure for the eye and ear. The story is well written, you never get bored for a second. I certainly will watch Justified again in the future.",2015
10,"Great stuff. I thought I would have to wait until September for the return of ""Sons of Anarchy"" for Tuesday nights to be worth staying home and sitting in front of the TV. I was wrong. This show is well written and acted. Timothy Olyphant gives Raylen Givens character just the right amount of cockiness to make him likable yet feared. I'd like to see more interaction with his father in future episodes. Raymond Berry is a great actor and perfectly cast as Arlo Givens. Also, Walton Goggins gives ""Justified"" a true villain that everyone can fear and his acting is another good reason to watch this show. He was great in ""The Shield"". Hopefully, the writers will find a way to keep him in future episodes.",2010
10,"After completing Breaking Bad, thinking that nothing could equal or ever surpass it, I found Justified. With no expectation other than I could possibly find something entertaining to watch since no more BB to watch. We have now watched all 4 seasons available on Netflix and can honestly say this is one brilliant brilliant series. In someways similarly to BB the web in intrigue builds episode on episode as do the characterisations. Also one of the key strengths of BB is that every character no matter how inconsequential plays a vital role in the development of the plot. Justified in many ways surpasses this.",2014
10,"Being a devotee of Justified (yes, I drank the Coolaid), I'm no stranger to being completely absorbed into the episodes. Excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent production, excellent character development will do that.",2015
10,"When I watched first season of justified, I thought to myself- Man, how fresh is this show? I got the same feeling that I got when I watched Firefly and even dreaded the same fate for this gem. But thank God that didn't happen. So we got the second season and I found out how the show matured without actually losing any of its inherent charm. Again, setting was perfect and Mags Bannet proved to be another worthy foe.. and then the history of between the clans.. I mean, everything was just pitch-perfect, even better than the first season. So then I asked myself another question. What will happen in later seasons? I mean, it's a great show and all. But all good things, finally & sadly, do have to come to an end and how many times do we see an end that is extremely painful, as the show descends into a sad state, trying to rescue itself from a grim fate by using cheap thrills, cameos that are just plain laughable and then network would cancel it anyway. We have all seen this happen to even the best of the shows. So how much juice was left in justified's engine, which was already running at near perfect revolutions per episode. But then, to my amazement, 3rd season happened and then 4th one with the amazing Drew Thompson story. It just kept getting better, against all odds, defying the fundamental laws of writing and acting and production valueit just pushed and pushed ahead. Now people may think that 5th season might have been one of the weakest, but I personally disagree. Crowes were not as vicious as other baddies, but they had their own charm. Even when this show (maybe) dragged, it had a better overall entertainment value than the lot of them. So we got then news (probably mid-season) that 6th was going to be its last season. And I was relieved. Creators and writers and all others involved, made a decision to preserve an image in the minds of the viewers that was different from that of every other successful show I know. And the image was.Not to crash and burn, but gracefully conclude this modern classic. I know critics look at this show and roll their eyes, nitpicking things that are just miniature compared to the overall impact of this fine piece of entertainment. ",2015
10,"Justified is an excellent,unforgettable and entertaining TV series that combines terrific direction,wonderful performances from Timothy Olyphant,Walton Googins and a great cast,fantastic Action,great dialog and a memorable theme song and score. All of those elements make Justified an outstanding show that is Crime Dramas and Television at their best.",2015
10,"I am very sad to see this show go. I can sit here at type out all the things that made this show great, but I think just telling how we enjoyed it will do a better job. My wife and I often use the hours after our children go to bed to relax and enjoy a show or 2 that we usually have to prerecord. We were lucky enough to catch this 1 early on, back when few people were watching. We kept telling our friends they should tune in and eventually they did, thanking us later. ",2015
9,"I like cop shows, I like shows that are well acted and literate. This manages the interesting knack of being both (how many other shows mention Of Human Bondage and quote Saul Bellow).",2012
9,"Cindy and I went to college at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Ky. We had many acquaintances from Harlan County - where Justified takes place. The re-creation of how friendly and laid back people are in Eastern Ky was the first thing that attracted me to Justified.",2015
10,"This is my all-time favorite television series. Yes, more than the Sopranos or The Wire or I Love Lucy or whatever. This show has Elmore Leonard's genius for dialog among a cast of wacky low-lifes. One standard for a good show/movie/book is that you can't just have a couple of compelling lead players, you need a talented supporting cast, and Justified has the deepest bench in the league. Walton Goggins routinely steals the show as Boyd Crowder, and Jere Burns as Win Duffy just eats up the screen. There's also a raft of redneck punks who are not quite smart enough to understand what's going on. If you want to watch a crime thriller with a lot of violence that will also regularly make you laugh out loud, Justified is the best.",2015
10,Love the show! I've netflixed justified up until season 4! Couldn't wait for them to start showing the 5th season. So I stream it weekly first thing! As i'm in UK they stopped airing it from s4!,2014
10,"Having been working abroad I missed this show entirely and it was highly recommended to me after discussing ""Deadwood"", which I ranked as an amazing show. So having some time on my hands on leave, I acquired the first two seasons and gave it a shot. I rate Timothy Olyphant highly in this type of role and wow did he deliver.Walton Goggins, another of my favorites from The Shield another favorite show was there too, so what a feast. The storyline, acting, editing , directing, music, sets.. in fact everything about the shows oozes ""professional"" It would be fair to say I was ""blown away"" by the show, now watching season three, which maybe doesn't have quite the same momentum of the first two seasons , but hey I'm not complaining at all...I could watch this all day....Raylen Givens is a man born beyond his time, his heart is in Tombstone or Dodge, and we're given the idea he plays out his life just like the old timers of old did.The character is a joy to behold. I seldom get time to watch good shows, but now added this to my favorites along with Deadwood, Dexter, band of brothers and Pacific. There's enough storyline explained in other reviews, I just wanted to go in print and add a big pat on the back to all involved with the show for making such a great show and putting a big smile on my face. I hope this show is planned to run a few more seasons yet. I feel Tim Olyphant has more scope to play with the Raylen Givens character yet.If you like the genre of Modern day westerns, I don't think anyone does it better than Timothy Olyphant and co.Sit back and immerse yourself in the atmosphere that is portrayed as Harlan County...and then tell me I was was wrong!",2012

10,"I have to admit I stumbled over ""Justified"" when channel surfing and I caught the Season 4 opener. I then watched the second episode of the season, and realized that to fully appreciate (much less understand!) the show, I'd need to see Seasons 1,2 and 3 to get caught up. Money well spent. I highly recommend that if you have not seen them, you will be well served by watching earlier episodes, either by retail DVD or, for a couple of bucks each, episodes on Amazon. Each season has a central story arc, especially Season 2 with the Bennett-Crowder-Givens family feud, and the Season 3 Frankfort mob-Givens-Crowder interplay. ",2013
9,"When I first started watching this series, it appeared as though it was slow but in reality a lot happens in each episode and the attention and focus of series is on dialog and character construction which is excellent. The dialog and script construction is the strength of the series and some of it is of incredible quality for a TV series of this kind.",2012
9,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.",2015
10,"The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.",2010
9,"Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.",2011
8,"I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special.",2010
10,"This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. ",2010
8,I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.,2010
8,"Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.",2010
8,"For fans of all things geeky around the world, this film is for YOU! Comedy, action, romance, video games, music; ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" has everything you could ask for. It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.",2014
4,"Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.",2010
9,"Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.",2011
10,"This is the perfect movie with perfect cast. I don't even like Michael Cera much, although he was fortunate enough to be in one of the most clever TV shows ever. He's become typecast, but this is one movie which breaks the mold. (Or at least it ignores it and does its own thing.) Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" and he doesn't disappoint with this. I haven't read the anime series this was based on, but I don't really want to, because this is so much better than it could ever be. To be completely honest, the only thing I don't like his how fast Scott's 'pee bar' empties. Nobody can pee that fast, geez.",2012
1,"This is a film for 20-something years olds living with their moms who still play Pokemon and drooling over manga. This movie has the intelligence level of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers and the maturity level of Spongebob Squarepants. It's really only a fifteen minute movie that repeats well over five times for two frikin hours. Sometimes less is more and when a movie is the equivalent to watching someone play Soul Calibur, 112 minutes is 90 minutes too long. It has all the terrible dialog from a Dragonball-Z cartoon with the same over exaggerated fight sequences that have the fighters spending more time screaming at each other as they fly through the air then they do actually fighting. The whole ""Video game style"" fighting over a girl would have been OK if it just happened once. But re-hashing the same damn fight four more times was just driving an idea into the ground all the way back to Japan.",2011
1,"The one star rating isn't something to be dispensed lightly; there are very few films that have so little in the way of entertainment value that they deserve such a critical pasting. Most flicks I've seen that fit comfortably into the category of 'awful' have some redeeming feature, even if it's the dreaded 'unintentional comedy' factor. That being said, when the movie in question is already being marketed as a comedy, a person can really find themselves reaching. So it is with SPVTW, a movie that manages to not only be thoroughly unentertaining and an ordeal to sit through, but one that doesn't even have the decency to let you laugh at it. This is that rare beast: a film that actually makes the rational audience member seethe and froth with rage at how shallow and calculating it is, how utterly empty and devoid of any soul or any artistic sensibility.",2010

1,"I like / love Edgar Wright's other movies (""Shaun..."" is easily one of the 10 best British films ever made and is endlessly quotable, and ""Fuzz"" so perfectly captures the vein of the genre it affectionately spoofs) as well as his TV show ""Spaced"" (final scene of first series filmed in my local!), so I was looking forward to this a lot; unfortunately I was really really disappointed.",2010
1,Being quite the fan of director Edgar Wright's previous efforts and being a self confessed gaming nut since 1981 and seeing the rise of the Nintendo generation from the beginning who supposedly this film is directed at. I was really excited and looking forward to spotting all the gaming references that Wright likes to sneak into his films and shows.,2010
1,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (or at least the first 45mins of it) is the most Putrid, Disgusting, Insulting, Vile, Humourless, Trendy, Ugly, Offensive, Appalling, Awful, Detestable, Dreadful, Obnoxious, Hideous, Loathsome, Pretentious and Repellent piece of film making i have ever seen! The acting was awful, the dialogue was awful, the characters were all horrible people, the editing was obnoxious and annoying, the special effects were obnoxious and annoying, the story was Annoying, the music was awful and there was Not one Single Redeeming or Likable Feature about The Whole Thing!",2010

I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...",2010
2,"I honestly wanted to like this movie because I liked Michael Cera's work in other titles like Youth in Revolt. However he often seems to be typecast as the lovable loser and in this film it just did not work for him, leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable.",2011
1,"Let's cut to the chase. This movie is woefully bad in almost every single aspect. The characters are vague, irritating, two-dimensional non-entities, and as such, I found it impossible to relate to any of them. In particular, Scott Pilgrim is a dull, whiny brat with no personality whatsoever. The rest of the ensemble are cardboard cut-outs aimed at an audience that must surely prize pre-teen rambling over actual conversation, and you'll be hard pushed to remember anything interesting that any one of them said after the movie.",2010
1,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat all the way through. Worst meaning; it bored me senseless. I was on the verge of turning it off several times and the only reason I let it keep playing was I somehow hoped it would come alive somewhere in the middle, or three quarters in, or even in the last few minutes. But it just doesn't. Despite having the potential to be a good movie - A girl with rad hair colour, a reasonably OK story line, comic strip captions, indie music and quite a few actors I like, it totally fails to be interesting in any way. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities about it. None. There are no characters to like. Or dislike. Since the main character is so totally unlikeable, it's impossible to dislike his enemies much and when you don't actually care if the ""evil exes"" take him out or not it renders the whole experience simply boring. Besides they don't seem that evil, I don't really know what was evil about them apart from being exes. Scott Pilgrim on the other hand is an utterly awful character, I'm glad he's fictional. I'd like to call him quite a few things but I'm pretty sure IMDb would censor them and not accept this review so I'm leaving them out cos I want to warn others before they waste money and an hour and a half of their lives on this movie. If there is such a category as ""indie B-movie"" this is it. Except that ""B-movie"" implies it's so bad it's at least funny. This is not even funny. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen all the way through. So if you decide to watch it despite reading this and it turns out you find it boring too during the first 20 minutes, SAVE YOURSELF! TURN IT OFF! You can spend the remaining 1hr 25 minutes doing something way more fun with your life. Cos pretty much ANYTHING will be more fun than watching the rest of this movie. If you're on the other hand aiming for death by boredom - carry on. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world will do the trick. Guaranteed.",2010
4,"The unique video game style of the movie was intriguing; however, the total lack of chemistry between the main characters made the story line rather unbelievable at times. Michael Cera had more chemistry with Kieran Culkin than with Mary Elizabeth Winsted. I hope that isn't what love looks like otherwise, I guess its not all its cracked up to be. Michael Cera plays the same geeky gangly hero that he has been typecast into for what looks like the rest of his young adult life. The music is original and great, and Alison Pill and Kieran Culkin both provide great moments of their own. Unfortunately, like Scott Pilgrim, this move never gets past second base...",2010
1,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Without a doubt: The WORST film I've ever seen. Pure garbage! The biggest dollop of toss on toast imaginable with absolute zero to recommend. I also really want to punch Michael Cera's lights out. This is a film made for lame ass, pseudo intellectual giants of 'cool' (because all that retro geek crap is way cool, isn't it?). Abominable, awful, atrocious, painful, horrifyingly BAD; I can't find the appropriate words to describe it. It almost gave my boyfriend an aneurysm. I thought he might have hit an old lady in the face, perhaps run into the road with the intention of getting hit by oncoming traffic or maybe even burn down ODEON cinema (I certainly considered that one). Oh yeah, we walked out after 40 minutes. Never again! Worse than the Clash of the Titans remake. I'd rather go on a date with Jeffrey Dahmer.",2010
10,"Yes, the show starts out dull and mindless. Yes, the show offers full frontal nudity. Yes, it's bloody violent (if you measure it in buckets of blood). No, it is NOT a storyless show.",2010
10,"For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I'm glad I didn't do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as ""gore and sex"" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can't say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the ""bad guys"" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in ""Rome"". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it's not the gore or sex that make it so.",2010
9,"I can't stand much of whats on TV. What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).",2010

If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.",2012
9,"Now, let's face the elephant in the room; there's a lot of sex, a lot of blood, a lot of gore, and a lot of foul mouthed characters. I for one couldn't care less about this, but in no way does it diminish it's writing; in fact, it enhances it.",2013
2,"May contain some general spoilers, but i'll try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible.",2010
10,"Spartacus is probably the best action/drama show currently on television. I had my doubts when i started watching the first season. But after i finished episode 5 and saw Spartacus' epic battle with Theokoles, I couldn't get enough of the show. Yet it isn't just the action that is so intriguing. Each character has their own motives and deceptions, and the plot twists are piled on so thick you never really know whats going to happen next. The story of Spartacus (which is based on an incredible true story) starts out from very humble beginnings, and grows until Spartacus is not only a God of the Arena; he also becomes the most feared enemy in all of Rome. He is betrayed countless times, and the viewer is made to really feel his pain and eventually want blood and vengeance just as much as he does. After the first season's huge success, the show and its fans suffered a very tragic loss in the untimely death of Andy Whitfield. I didn't think the show could go on, since Andy played Spartacus so masterfully that any other actor would pale in comparison. But Liam McIntyre came into the 2nd season and did a very admirable job. Both seasons (and Spartacus: Gods of the Arena) were very well written and acted, and I can't wait to see the final season- Spartacus: War of the Damned",2013
10,"Spartacus was the The Best Show Ever i watched. It has craft fully portrayed the picture of a legend : Sparatcus. Intense plot , great fight sequences , explicit sex scenes and wonderful acting. I wish there should be another season of this show. Really missing it",2013
8,"I have only seen twelve episodes so far. So my review is hardly comprehensive. But based on what I did see, I can say that ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" starts badly, but then improves remarkably in episodes #2-6. When I saw the first episode, my impression was that this series was not going to be successful. The first episode was like watching warfare on a computer screen rather than realistic battle scenes for which Braveheart has set the standard. The first episode was also shameless in the way it employed softcore pornography. Add to that the simplistic dialogue and the contrived performances and I came away with the distinct impression that ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" was not really about anything in particular, but on the contrary was a vehicle for selling gratuitous violence and sex. ",2010
3,"If you liked ""300"" for its over the top everything, blood, and sex, then this is just what you have been waiting for. If you are looking for another ""Rome"" just keep on looking. This series is not for people who liked ""Rome."" You are not going to find good acting, dialogue, writing, or likable characters here. What you will find is a spiritual sequel to ""300"" and all the fun stuff and green screens that went with it. There is no substance but it is still fun. Three episodes in and I am done with it. I figured I would give the show a chance and I have seen all I want to see. I adored HBO's ""Rome"" and this is a silly joke in comparison.",2010
9,"Overall all the four series are visually stunning. The show was meant to have a graphic novel look. The stunt co-ordination is outstanding. Costumes are magnificent. The score is beautiful. The acting on this show is stellar. The actors gave it their all. Unafraid to show raw emotions, and yet be capable of subtle expressions as well. The writing, well my rating says it all, very impressive. The linguistics on the show has a subtle modern-English quality that flows easily, is accessible to everyone, and gives it an historical flavor. The show encompasses plenty of gender role reversals situations. Gay relationships are not seen as a big deal. Indeed completely normal, and beautiful as shown with Agron and Nasir. ",2013
10,"Imagine everything that (most) women would find deep and intimate and meaningful in a movie/TV series. Now, take all that crap and throw it out the window! Now take everything that a man would find intensely gratifying in a movie, and turn up the volume! Then you have an idea of what Spartacus: Blood and Sand is. It doesn't get any better than this when it comes to intrigue, CGI effects and downright depravity. Stuff to make the Romans proud and the parents of children in a decadent society shutter. The character development is so calculated and thorough that when final outcomes are reached, it never fails to leave the audience in shock. The sheer diabolical nature of just about everyone in this series is sure to bring many cheers during the season finale! As an intellectual, I can appreciate the darkness as much as the Light. No show on television presents it more vividly!",2010
1,"If you enjoy naked, sweaty men grappling each other, this is for you. Full frontal nudity: Crixus standing there while a patrician Roman woman inspected his goods was a little too much. Shaved pubic hair and the black skin of his penis is a sure indicator of steroid abuse. We have characters alternately speaking like Shakespeare and then hurling obscenities as if they were on an inner city bus after the local ghetto school was let out. Soft core porn of men doing women, men doing men, and women doing women and you pretty much see what this is really about. Extremely phony fight scenes where gladiators fight on after losing 40% of their blood... This has nothing to do with Spartacus - it's just a revolting exploitation vehicle. I stopped watching it. What's up with the signature scene, appearing in each episode, where a gladiator gets whacked in the face, his head spins around, and a pint of blood splashes out of his mouth? Then he always continues as if nothing had happened, without so much as a swollen lip.",2010
1,"I bought this series thinking about the ""Rome"" series from HBO and the 1960's ""Spartacus"". Big mistake! While the graphical effects by themselves can impress video games fans and teenagers, and the graphics artist did a good job depicting liquids in motion, there is NOTHING for an intelligent audience. The graphics and the boring slow motion is copying everything from the movie ""300"" and gets incredibly repetitive. You basically see gallons of blood flying in the air in slow motion, like people would be some soft of bags full of liquid ready to burst and spill at every impact. And then the gross historically inaccuracies. Basically, the movie starts with the Thracians under Roman occupation, and in the situation where are they get raided by no one else but the Getae, a Thracian tribe, basically their brothers. The Getae, while considered barbarians by the Romans due to their own ignorance, were quite civilized, though feared warriors nonetheless. The Getae end up being depicted as some sort of masked savages, with stone axes, coming from the forests to sack villages and rape Thracian women. They look more like Germanic tribes, maybe Goths, or maybe some stone age people from a different age! While historically, the Getae were riding the Romans and trying to help their Thracian brothers. The Thracians are depicted more like Spartans (maybe because sounds similar with Spartacus?) wearing the stereotypical English longs swords which doesn't belong to this place and time, when in reality both Thracians and their kin, the Getae, used to wear Phrygian caps, clothing (yes!), had horses, and above all, curved swords called falx and sica. And these are just some scenes in the first episode! So much for history! And then the dialogue reminds me of porn movies (...) I think this series is only suitable for uneducated teenagers and shallow, immature adults, maybe to some computer geeks, looking to see some blood, soft porn and adventure packaged in a very stereotypical and ignorant fashion. Unfortunately these days so many movies and series head in this direction where graphics replace acting, dialogue, historical facts, directing, everything! All we watch is violent computer games. Disappointing!",2011
1,"I went into this with a skeptical attitude and wanted it to be great! I love Epics and being a fan of the Epics of the 1950's and 1960's, and the original SPARTACUS with Kirk Douglas in particular, I was very interested in what would be done with this version. I have no problem with differences in the interpretation of the story since the true history of the actual Spartacus is very sketchy. Historians know very little about many of the details in his life and the military campaigns, so I'm open to changes in one dramatic version over another. ",2011

I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.",2010

It feels like ridiculous PG-13 action sequences strung together by character's explaining it's all a dream within a dream etc. When watching this film, I thought of far superior films about dreams and alternate realities, Bunuel and Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou"" (1929), ""The Blood of a Poet"" (1930), ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" (1946), ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" (1947), Dr. Sues' ""5,000 Fingers of Dr. T"" (1953), ""Le Jetee"" (1962), Fellini's ""8 1/2"" (1963), ""Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors"" (1963) Fellini's, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" (1966), ""Who Wants to Kill Jesse"" (1966), ""Valerie and her Week of Wonders"" (1970), ""Viva La Muerte"" (1970), ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972), Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" (1972), ""The Hourglass Sanitorium"" (1973), ""Eraserhead"" (1977) ""Altered States"" (1980), ""Time Bandits"" (1981), Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" (1982), ""Forbidden Zone"" (1982) ""Videodrome"" (1983), ""A Nightmare on Elmstreet"" (1984), ""Dreamscape""(1984), ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Paperhouse"" (1988), The B-movie ""Beyond Dreams Door"" (1989), ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990), ""Kurosawa's Dreams"" (1990) ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Naked Lunch"" (1991), ""Arizona Dream"" (1993), John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"" (1995), ""12 Monkeys"" (1995),""City of Lost Children"" (1995), ""Lost Highway"" (1997), ""Dark City"" (1998), ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""eXistenZ"" (1999), ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Waking Life"" (2001), ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), ""Muholland Drive"" (2001), ""Demon Lover"" (2002), ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004), ""Strange Circus"" (2005), ""The Fall"" (2006), ""The Science of Sleep"" (2006), ""Pan's Labrynth"" (2006), ""Paprika"" (2006) and the list goes on and on and on. 100's of French and Asian films; hell, even the ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" sequels.",2010

User reviews raved over ""Despicable Me"", when it was about as entertaining as a ""Dexter's Lab"" rerun. And now? ""Inception"" is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very creative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they're dreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner or later you stop caring about the actual action because it's a dream. So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the pouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name float around a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd greatest movie ever? You must be dreaming.",2010
1,"Well, first of all, I have to absolutely clearly admit that I'm writing this review to lower the rating of this movie, since it was one of the biggest movie disappointments of my life. Currently 9.1 for this thing is unbelievably high. But I guess I get why the rating of this movie is so high. It makes the people feel good about themselves because they understood the ""complicated"" plot. Yes, thats it! Inception actually managed to plant the idea to the people that it was a good movie. At best its an average action movie with too long boring action scenes with the ""added value"" of a ""smart"" story. However the story is not smart at all. Its about people that somehow are able to get into people's dreams and do stuff there, or even go to dreams in dreams, and dreams in dreams in dreams, and limbo... Wow, you get it? You are really smart, and should rate this movie 10!!! But seriously, this story is really stupid. Why should I care that the Japanese guy wants to destroy the other guy's (the scarecrow from Batman) company? How did the architect girl become expert on dreams and psychology after two dream sessions? How are they even able to get into the dreams? I guess the acting overall is not bad, but who cares if the plot is so annoying. And finally, the twist at the end is really predictable. Yay, the spinning thing stops to spin: he might be dreaming! Really original. You might say that I did not get the message of the movie. Well, I did get it, but it was too stupid to care about it.",2010
10,"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.",2010
1,"Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.",2011

1,"UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) ",2010

4,"I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value.

1,"But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an ""intellectual"" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:",2011

1,"Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.",2011
9,"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.",2011
1,"I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; ""OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!"" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;""I don't really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!"" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!!",2011
5,"A visual Tour De Force that gets lost in its own complex world, Inception stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb; a rogue 'extractor' who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder, all in the name of corporate espionage. But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.",2011
10,"I have to say I loved Downton Abbey, and thought it was one of the better programmes airing this year along with Luther, Sherlock and the stunning Channel 4 drama Mo. Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.",2010
10,"I was hooked after the first five minutes and come heaven, hell or high water, I was going to see Downton Abbey twice, the second time to pick up the points which I knew would be too fast, and possibly convoluted, to follow the first time round. I have watched Masterpiece since the inaugural with Alistair Cooke, and I can't remember anything as engaging and entertaining as this. As a cousin of an English family with deep affection for the monarchy and respect for the aristocracy, my perspective is an odd mix of Democratic ideals, old-time Republican values and curiosity about and appreciation of the social structure which prevailed so long in England. Downton Abbey appears to present a very balanced depiction of the social, political, economic and historical forces which drove the lives and fortunes of the classes and produced strange and almost incomprehensible behavior to comply with an unwritten, all-pervasive code. I am completely fascinated by the events and reactions and what would appear to be almost puppet-like behavior on occasion. I pray for a sequel.",2011
10,"I'll agree that the British know how to do period drama better than anyone (certainly better than us Americans) and this is no exception. You'll be captivated immediately and hours will go by before you realize you've spent an entire afternoon in front of your television set. The relationships built between all characters of this show are what tie it up in a nice, fluffy (although not always pretty) bow. Brilliantly written and set in lush, vibrant surroundings with detailed costuming, this drama series should set the bar for others. No busy dialog or wasted scenes, just good, solid craftsmanship in every episode of this poignant family story. You'll do well to invest in seasons 1 and 2. Looking forward to the arrival of season 3!",2011

10,"Julian Fellowes' intelligent (and sophisticated) take on pre-World War I society of aristocrats and worker-bees is smart-writing on the changes we will see over the next 25 years, encompassing two major wars and a great depression. The writing and the casting make this many steps above ""soap opera"" as the themes of social mobility and aristocratic incompetence are sharply etched.",2011
8,"For me at least Downton Abbey was elegant, controlled and subtly witty. The scenery, of course, is very good. (anyone interested can find short interviews with actor Hugh Bonneville and writer Julian Fellowes via youtube and be infected with their enthusiasm as well as getting an explanation, if you need one, of the setting) The house is suitably dramatic and the fabrics, the costumes, the camera shots of ringing bells and curious meal courses in the form of fences of asparagus, the morning light, or lit windows across the lawn, and the smooth work of all the actors make it something to watch and be both interested and relaxed. There is just enough drama and just enough calm, nothing seems overdone, and (after two episodes) the characters, as it switches between moments of their various days, are none of them an unwelcome change from the view of the last. It is a costume drama but 1912 after all was just as real as 2010 and it is, quite separate from costumes, about people, several different people, house workers and owners, their motives, their histories, pain, relationships, scheming allegiances, awkwardness or ease, old ways and the coming of those things we now call modern electric lights, the middle classEnjoyable so far. However, if you find these things dull, if you need constant shocks, use the word inoffensive as an insult or dislike all period dramas, scenery or rich peoplestay away. It's not hard to do.",2010
7,"I am not as over the top about this series as the rest of the world seems to be. There is no doubt that it is a very competent work with high production values and an enormous budget. But I never felt any ""love"" for any of the characters, and I never felt that desire that you can feel when a work of fiction is really, really good, to be part of it and live in that world there with them.",2016
10,"Having had my fill of 'detective/mystery/thrillers', I have longed for a 'proper drama'. Here we have a wonderful piece, drawing comparisons with such milestones as 'Upstairs, Downstairs', 'The Onedin Line' and the BBC's 1990's production of 'Pride & Prejudice'. An excellent cast, marvellous sets, costumes, writing and storyline make this a truly marvellous (and rare) television event.",2010
8,"Oh my. I just changed my 10 star review to 5. Downton Abbey really turned out to be an incredible disappointment. What a silly, silly show. Yes, the acting is wonderful. The costumes and sets are sublime. The music is wonderful. But the writing? Oh dear, how embarrassing. What really gets me, more than the soap-opera-esque plot lines that insult even average intelligence, is how many of the plots just drop off into thin air, while other torturous boring plots just won't ever end. Plots that go nowhere actually started in right in the beginning with Season 1. Examples of Plots in DA that go absolutely no where: 1. The first plot that really got me interested in the show was The Countesses plot to ""smash the entail."" As she sits there with Lady Grantham discussing this, we discover not only that the countess has the conniving intention to radically smash the entail but also the juicy indication that she and the countess are not friendly mother and daughter-in-law. What a wonderful set up for things to come. Didn't you think this was going to be the central theme of the entire series? I was so intrigued. But these two plot lines go absolutely nowhere. There is no ""smashing of the entail"" nor any real attempt to do so. Lady Grantham is told ""sorry Charlie. Your money is tied up in the estate for good,"" and the plot is dead, face down in the water. And the tension between mom and daughter in law? Nothing. What a waste. 2. Second potentially great plot line (if a bit silly) that really goes nowhere: The Turk in Mary's bed who just suddenly dies. A healthy 22 year old just dies? Didn't you think it was going to be poisoning or something? Didn't you think we were going to find out why he died? Nope. The only thing that comes of it is a silly sister quarrel and Edith's attempt to tattle tale. The word ridiculous comes to mind. 3. Another potentially good plot that goes no where: Ethel's flirtations with the farmer. Now this could have been really really good. Rich young woman getting involved with a poor farmer – uh-oha MARRIED farmer But nope. Goes nowhere. 4. Next plot that disappears (kind of glad actually) like a fart in the wind: The disfigured military dude who says he is Patrick- the heir to the estate that supposedly died on the Titanic. This is where I really turned my back on Downton Abbey. I literally laughed out loud. But even if the plot line was soap opera silly in the third degree, at least have the plot properly develop and resolve. Once again the plot falls off a cliff: The mysterious soldier suddenly makes an unusual gesture that Lord Grantham recognizes. Remember that? What was that gesture? Interesting.... Where will this go? whups... Nope. Goes nowhere. 5. Lady Grantham is pregnant? Ooo this is good! What if it is a boy? The heir to the estate is in question again. Uh. Nope. Within 10 minutes of finding out she is pregnant she slips on soap that her lady's maid leaves on the floor outside the tub and loses the baby. Next. 6. Lord Grantham's ""affair?"" Sloppy, rushed, no development, no anticipation, no build. He just suddenly leans over and kisses a maid. Really really awful. Yet with all these potentially interesting plots that don't develop and/or completely dissipate, we are forced to endure other plots that leave us utterly exasperated. I really couldn't have endured one more minute of the 20 year old Anna and the 50 year old fat-faced Bates, yet we were tortured with this stupid tale for 2 seasons. OK. Nuf said. Downton Abbey has made me Down-right Crabby.",2011
2,"If you thought Gosford Park needed to be a shallow, episodic TV series, you might enjoy this. Even Maggie Smith (and her character) has been borrowed wholesale to ease your transfer. And what luck, the theme music is a thinly veiled knock-off of the title music from The Piano. But Gosford Park wrestled with matters of substance, and showcased some striking film technique.",2011
3,"Back in the 1980s Granada made two long drama serials at almost the same time. One was ""Brideshead Revisited"" based on Evelyn Waugh's novel and the other was ""Jewel in the Crown"" – the dramatisation of Paul Scott's extraordinary ""Raj Quartet"". Both these series were masterpieces and if you watch them today you will find they have stood well the test of time. The drama tradition of Granada, of some of the other commercial companies and, of course, of the BBC is strong and is something of a jewel in the crown of British television. It is also an important source of revenue, not least in the United States, where posh British TV has a small but well-heeled following. This brings me to ""Downton Abbey"", superficially in the great tradition and with obvious links also to the very successful and ground-breaking ""Forsyte Saga"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs"" of the 1960s and 1970s. Downton is set in the second and third decades of the twentieth century and we have moved from Edwardian complacency and excesses through the horrors of the Great War to the early 1920s. As with ""Upstairs Downstairs"" we see life, and to an extent history, through the eyes of the aristocracy and simultaneously from the perspective of those in the Servants' Hall.",2011

6,"I really liked it!! And though I found myself wanting more, more!, I have to admit that the compactness of this series (only 7 episodes) is likely critical to what kept it excellent. Limited to a finite number of episodes, a story can be tight and focused. If this one were to become a permanent serial, silly and ""unnatural"" (if that word can be applied to fiction) things might have to start happening in order to keep the plot going, and I'd be sorry for that.",2010
2,I was looking forward to this but I was disappointed. This series is overrated. Am I the only one who thinks this isn't all that? Firstly the good points - the setting and atmosphere are well done. The grand old historic home location is quite attractive.,2012
10,"DOWNTON ABBEY is one of the things the British do best. This seven part series has it all - crisp dialogue, stunning settings/scenery/costumes, an all-encompassing view of class distinction not only between the upper class or gentry versus the middle class (who often have as much money but come into via labor versus inheritance) but also among the servant class, and a cast of many of the finest British actors before the public. Julian Fellowes is in fine form here as the writer, taking on a story about 1912 England and the microcosm of Downton Abbey, a mansion and grounds run by the elegant Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith at her best), and Cora Crawley Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern0 - the moneyed American whom Robert married in order to retain the Abbey and their daughters, Ladies Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael) and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay). Much of the story revolves around the problem of inheritance (entailment) as the heirs apparent to the Abbey are victims of the Titanic disaster that opens the story. The Abbey must be passed on to a monied heir and the hunt is on. ",2011

1,"Downton Abbey is absolute unmitigated drivel. I have never seen or heard such tripe! I felt sure it was written by an American, given the deliberate blurring of social strata, with sullen and insolent staff, naive and over-familiar upper-class, and altogether far too much scheming and intrigue. It smacks of a daytime soap opera! What nonsense! It's also terribly ""choppy"", with scenes lasting only 30 seconds to a minute (perhaps why it's so popular in the U.S.). The characters are also too entirely comical and cliché. The distant, preoccupied lord, clueless as to the goings-on under his own roof, the stuffy butler, the fussy cook, the meddling house-keeper. Good grief! I cannot believe that people actually buy this insipid vomit! From a cultural and historically social perspective, it is entirely inaccurate. The writing is like from some Harlequin novel rubbish. And the acting is over-done and clumsy (they are all trying far too hard to ""act""!).",2012
9,"...and this show is the perfect example. I managed to watch both seasons in just 2 days. It was like reading a good book, I just couldn't put down my laptop :) I am doing the second round right now, taking it slower and enjoying it minute by minute.",2012
9,"I will admit upfront I was more than a bit dismissive about Downton Abbey upfront. It sounded like another attempt at recreating Upstairs, Downstairs. I knew of the pedigree of Julian Fellowes, having watched and enjoyed Gosford Park. The acting and writing were first rate there, but I found much of it to be overly romantic about a system designed solely to benefit the privileged. In Gosford Park, that world is the setting for a mystery,; here, it's a soap opera (ok, drama). Doesn't sound appealing to a firmly middle class American revolutionary,does it? And yet, it is.",2012
3,"This show offers you good acting, some humor and nice camera work. But if you value details and/or have knowledge about the era, you might want to punch the screen. For example in the first scene you can notice servants wearing white bow tie (only gentlemen are allowed to wear white). You can see Ford Model T several times, a car that is produced after 1921. Moreover they talk about ""Turkey"" which is founded in 1923 and they call a Turkish man with his surname, but Turkey didn't use surname until 1934. Furthermore language and social interactions are so much modern for 1910s. Also, all men are perfectly shaved. In reality at least half of them should have unique mustache. ",2016

Dating teachers and withholding knowledge of a father's affair, stealing sister's boyfriends, stealing sunglasses, and lesbian interests are only the beginning of the secrets that the mysterious texter can potentially spill. The biggest one involves setting a garage on fire, blinding one person and blackmailing another to make him take the wrap for it all.",2010

I began watching this show because my fiancé enjoys it, so I figured I would give it a chance. But like all ABC Family shows, it lacks everything that makes a show good. None of the characters are likable, nor do they behave like a normal person would. The plot is so slow, I could probably skip 3 seasons and they still won't know who A is. If the books are to be followed, then Ali is still alive. My questions are: Why does she hate the liars so much? How is she everywhere, and how does she have everything already planned out? Why doesn't she just kill the liars? My major beef with this show is they are trying to drag it out and get as many viewers as possible. They're doing it in the wrong way though. A mystery show is supposed to give you clues, substantial ones. I don't mind that they ask questions, but they need to answer them as well. Also, the characters need to not be so stupid. I feel like I'm watching a B grade horror movie where they characters always do the opposite of what a normal human would do.",2013

Somehow it gave me my life back. The characters are all so relatable. I identify the most with Hanna and Spencer. Most of all, it covers REAL issues. Hanna's ED, her dad leaving, Mike's depression after the parents divorce, Spencer's struggle to be perfect in her family, Emily coming out to her parents. This show has a lot of depth. It's fantastic. Please watch this show! You won't regret it. It can be very intense but also comedic at times. I think that everyone can relate to at least one character.",2013

2,"This is the worst thing I've seen on TV recently. I could hardly finish watching the first episode. It's a great setup and I was intrigued by the plot but then the girls arrived on screen and they screwed up everything for me. It was soon revealed how simplistic all of them are: one kisses a guy a couple minutes after they meet (at the age of 16), the other kisses a girl a couple hours after they meet, the third steals her sister's boyfriends and the fourth steals from the mall. I mean what is this all about?? The writing isn't much better either. The dialogs are flat, the only suspense is about A and the subplots were revealed too soon. How on earth did it get sold, I'll never understand.",2012
1,"For years I've been a loyal follower to the show. They have had some massive disappointments in the past but I always assumed it would lead somewhere better. The 6A finale proved me wrong. 90% of what we see, the clues and the interesting plot lines have actually nothing to do with the show and even the main characters turn out to be extras in a plot that has nothing to do with them. Most things have happened ""because"" and the answers are far and few between. There are massive plot holes and when pointed out the producers and writers have called the viewers entitled and childish. The timeline doesn't add up and no one will address it. I was in love with this mystery but it turns out to be different than it seemed.",2015

10,"..with delight. A brilliantly written, well acted programme. Well done to all concerned. The story had me hooked from the start.All the elements of Holmes are present and correct. So far most of the original characters have appeared, with hints of more yet to appear. It is suspenseful and sometimes genuinely funny. I have read all the original stories, and after the late, great Jeremy Brett, despaired of ever seeing another top notch Holmes film. This is it, Brought up to date into the 21st century, but done with affection and respect to the original. Nice to see the writers have continued the theme of an intelligent (slightly bemused) Watson. CAN WE HAVE A FULL SERIES PLEASE. If not this is one I will return to again and again.",2010
10,"It's after 2am and I have just registered on IMDb after watching the first ep of Sherlock as I was compelled to get it out there that this show presents some PURE BRILLIANCE in its delivery of my favourite fictional detective. Hard to believe they could create a setting in modern times where the illustrious Holmes and Watson set off on their adventures and absolutely GET IT RIGHT, in every aspect. Sir Arthur would, I believe, approve of this adaptation and be pleased that yet another generation is able to live the thrill of the chase, the connection of obscure yet obvious (to a genius) clues... the little things that have a far greater relevance than you would normally perceive. For a first episode... BUGGER ME, I am more than hooked and now await more installments and hope that each episode is as brilliant as the last... I have a feeling it will continue from strength to strength as we delve deeper into the darkness that is the mind of Sherlock Holmes. if they had an 11 out of 10 rating... that's my vote. The game is definitely on my dear Watson!",2010
10,"To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for Sherlock Holmes-he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything.",2010
10,"I have been an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from a very young age, and my first reaction upon hearing of a modern TV remake was ""oh bugger, they are so going to screw this up"". However, i am glad to report that, unlike so many other TV adaptations and especially ones that modernise, i found it witty, clever and above all, entertaining. It was extremely reverential of its considerable pedigree and included a large number of coded references and callbacks for the more avid fan, e.g. the use of scratches around a persons mobile phone charger port to indicate a drunkard rather than a pocket watches winding keyhole. I imagine many were irked by this and as i can see from the ratings many did not care for it at all, but for me it was simply sublime, and well deserving of a 10 out of 10",2010
10,"I think it is always a bit uncertain and tricky when a 19th century series or film is modernised and most of the time it doesn't work, especially if it is well known and liked but I was very very impressed. Benedict does a brilliant job portraying the famous sleuth and made a 19th century character and modern day London merge beautifully. Martin Freeman was also great as Dr Watson. Rupert Graves made a brilliant Lestrade. It was sharp, quick and kept you on your toes and you just couldn't wait to see what happened next, this was of course completed by brilliant acting from the actors. I'm so pleased it got favourable reviews from the critics, roll on the next episode!!!!",2010
8,"When someone pointed me to Sherlock- a new series on BBC I was, to say the least, a bit skeptical. On top of that, I was told that this Sherlock lived in London in 2010 and was fond of texting on his Blackberry and hosted a website? Color me confused! But I gave it a looksie –after all how bad could it be- Holmes is Holmes. On screen appears a lanky young fellow in a trench coat, getting high on nicotine patches who I am supposed to believe is Sherlock Holmes? This was, as far from my favorite pipe smoking, deer hunting cap wearing image of Holmes, as it could be. I rolled my eyes-this is going to be cheesy. But then in one swift sequence "" the lanky young Holmes"" in his first meeting with John Watson describes him, his profession , his relationship with his brother and his brother's marital status-all by one look at his cell phone (that's right his cell phone). BANG! I was hooked. This is Sherlock Holmes through and through.",2011

10,"One word to describe this show..'excellent'. A true master piece. I am a huge fan of the original Sherlock Holmes books and TV shows. When I sat down to watch this, at the first glimpse I was a bit disappointed. The show started in a somewhat different way than I imagined. Few minutes later, I found out that the 'difference' I experienced is what makes this series unique and brilliant. The cast is spot on. Couldn't have picked a better guy for Holmes or Lestrade. Yet, Dr. Watson doesn't match the original picture.Who cares hey? The story is full of twists and turns and fascinating to see the techniques of deduction. The merging of old reasoning and new technology has been done magnificently. So, its a Holmes with a laptop and a smart phone.that who we see.and that can be easily related than those 1800's detective.",2010
10,"As a die-hard fan of the source material, I have tracked down and went through nearly every radio, television, film, and comic book interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - which run a mean gamut regarding quality, as you probably already know - and so I approached this incarnation skeptical but sanguine. Doubtful it would match the eminent Jeremy Brett series in quality, but hopeful it might preserve Conan's tone - something I think that series did well and the Downey Jr. movie did not.",2010

6,"Season 4 is unwatchable. Actually, no--it's torturous to endure (especially as one may recall the sheer brilliance of seasons 1-2 and partially, season 3). The show has now escalated into a sordid combination of confusion, blandness, and over-sentimentality.",2017
6,"Not sure if we can give rating to shows for each season separately. Current IMDb rating says this is a 9.3. I agree with this rating, if it is only for the first season. As the series has progressed, the show has become more and more clichéd, unnecessarily stylized and unreasonably coincidental. The only reason I watched all 3 seasons is in the hope that the show will get back to its original groove, which it doesn't.",2017
6,"Basically, this show needs to settle the hell down. God, was it fun at the beginning; it was inventive, believable, and immersive. The natural chemistry between the characters was a delight, and the writing was clever and funny (when appropriate). That was Season 1. It was great. Since then, the show's general quality has been on the gradual decline; however, there have still been flashes of brilliance from time to time over the past couple of seasons. But now the show has worked itself so far up its own backside – like some vulgar ouroboros – that it's become almost intolerable watching. Season 4 was so self-referential and unfocused that it felt like a spoof half the time, but then it would perform a complete 180 and get all serious on us, with the expectation that the audience should get all misty eyed when a character carks it or someone experiences some manner of personal hardship. This would be perfectly fine for viewers with certain insanities, or those who were so permanently struck by 'Sherlock''s glistening first impression that they're oblivious to how far they've followed the show into its own bullcack, but for the rest of us who appreciate consistent style and careful execution of tone, it's unimmersive at best and painful at worst. I'm telling you, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat have written these screenplays schizophrenically. The only way to enjoy a narrative of this kind would be to possess an unrelated set of mood swings that miraculously synchronised with Gatiss and Moffat's wild shifts in tone. ",2017
6,"If I was to rate the Sherlock Holmes series on season 4 alone, I would give this 0/10 if possible. Benedict Cumberbatch (Holmes) was barely tolerable and the new surprise character was appalling. Without giving away too much, they draw a parallel to who this character is ""meant to be like"". Sad to say that the performance wasn't even in the ballpark. I found myself biting my fist to dull the pain.",2017
1,"I used to worship this show. Season one? As someone who loves 19th century literature, Sherlock Holmes in particular, I'm finding it hard to comprehend the season four finale. Don't get me wrong; season one and two were good. I loved the cases, the way they humanised John and Sherlock in a way lots of adaptations seem to forget to do. Season three went a little off the rails but it was alright because there was character development and something that seemed to be leading into a decisive, interesting plot. But no. Season four was one of the worst things I've ever seen. There were continuity errors, plot holes and even instances where cameras were visible in shots. The final episode was almost too bad for me to watch, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A grenade on a drone? It all seemed like a joke. In retrospect, the show was nothing more than a clever crime drama with some fancy camera-work. It's constant use of gay people as punchlines (ie; queerbaiting) only got worse as the series progressed, not to mention the fact that almost all of the villains were queercoded, something I thought we'd left in the 90s.",2017
5,"Season 1 and Season 2 are a wonderful, engaging and entertaining. Both actors did great in bringing a long loved character into the 21st century. It was fast, entertaining and captivating. Season1 and 2 deserve are highly recommended.",2017
4,"I loved Sherlock seasons 1 and 2, and was eagerly looking forward to season 3. Alas... something seems to have gone horribly wrong. In seasons 1 and 2 the focus was on the crimes, the 'cases' and the brilliant and very original way in which Sherlock solved them. All the modern media (emails, iPhone texts, etc.) were used to great effect. And the 'tone' of the series was intelligent, rational and occasionally very witty. In series 3 the focus is no longer on the crimes and on how to solve them. Instead, endless time is devoted to the relationship between Sherlock and John, how they are really, really not gay (okay, we get it, enough already!), on John's new wife (what happened to the girl he was dating in series 2, she was much prettier and younger), and on the relationship between John and his wife, between Sherlock and John's wife, etc. etc. Also, there is constant reference to Sherlock being a 'high-functioning sociopath', followed by proof that he is really a warm, feeling human being. I can only deduce that some American producer stepped in... Worst of all, the plot, particularly in episodes 1 and 2, is dealt with haphazardly: okay, the bomb just had an off switch, and in episode 2: okay, if you keep your belt tightly fastened you won't bleed to death. I have to say that I found episode 3 slightly better, thanks mainly to the appearance of Lars Mikkelsen, whom I've seen in The Killing and who is a brilliant actor, in my opinion. And (possibly) bringing back Moriarty might be a good idea, I thought he was great in season 2. Although I hope they won't go for the twins angle.... Anyway, season 4 would have to be a big improvement in this for me to keep watching!",2014
6,"Sherlock This series is difficult to write about, because it flew so high at the beginning, re imagining Holmes as a troubled but brilliant modern detective and Watson as a haunted but loyal man of action, in episodes promising to be re-interpretations of classic stories in an era of high technology. But it has fallen so low, riddled with the writers' own personal manias, and Steven Moffat's decision to twist his narratives (no longer 'stories' in the conventional sense), to redesign Holmes as a troubled and alienated super-hero wandering aimlessly through visual gimmickry and spectacular effects. The third episode of Season 3 is especially appalling. The moment towards the end when Sherlock shouts ""I am not a hero, I am a functioning sociopath!"" was so painful, I still can't get it out of my head. That moment surely has nothing to do with the character of Sherlock Holmes, the all-too-human hero (which he most certainly was) created by Conan Doyle, but it defines how Moffat and his team understand *their* character, 'Sherlock,' and perhaps how they understand their audience as well. Given the popularity of this show, apparently many young people do not want exceptional humans capable of resolving difficult problems, they want sick people with friends in high places who can thrash the arrogant and get away with it.",2014

7,"Enjoyed the previous seasons a lot but this 2017 4th season has strained trying to outdo itself and has reached a point of ridiculousness that has left me impatient and constantly punctures the suspension of disbelief it takes for the audience to go with the story. There's little consistency shown in the surprise character of the season who shows up at the end of The Lying Detective and takes over in The Final Problem like a computer hacker taking control of the characters and the dynamics between them to which we have become attached and enjoyed so much. I think it was a mistake trying to be edgier, bombastic and to rely so much on action, effects and novelty.",2017
7,"Sherlock is a brilliant take on the Sherlock Holmes stories. In season 1 and 2 that is. With season 3 something went horribly wrong. The episodes seemed to last forever and they were busy, confusing and pointless. What a disappointment. The many flashbacks, twist and turns were more of a hindrance that a help. Episode 3 was totally off the rails and even after watching the episode twice i still didn't understand the clue. Because Sherlock is written by the same person who writes Doctor Who, i believe he was mixing the two shows. Often i had the feeling i was watching a episode of Doctor Who.",2014
9,"The new shows this fall have almost all been hugely disappointing, starting with the new ""Law and Order: LA"" which proves that the concept of the show is starting to get old, ""The Event"" is yet another bunch of twists and turns that will end in the middle of nowhere sooner or later and the hugely anticipated ""Hawaii-Five-O"" started out strong, but has now taken a turn for the worse, although it's still among the better new shows, which frankly isn't saying much.",2010

Now I'm not sure if you're thinking that that doesn't jive with the heading on this review, if you are please remember two things 1)If I could give half points I would have given 8 and a half and 2)I'm very hard to please when it comes to movies and TV.",2010
8,"The cast is first rate and the best thing about the show so far. Tom Selleck is maturing so well you almost forget about the youthful, carefree version of the actor. Today he carries a world weary, solid presence that makes him totally believable as Frank Reagan, the top cop of New York. The interactions between the younger Reagans are spot on and believable. Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan in particular are interesting and move the stories along. The rest of the cast is fine with only Len Cariou's role giving a slightly false note, not because of the excellent veteran actor, but because someone thought it would be cool to give him a limp and a cane... hmmmm, a retired older Irish cop with a bum leg and a cane, sounds slightly familiar -- I keep expecting Daphne to appear saying it's time for his therapy.",2010
10,"I've always been a Tom Selleck fan, from his earliest TV performances. He brings class, sophistication and integrity to his performances. The rest of the cast for Blue Bloods meshes well with the high standards set here.

It is also very refreshing to see an ensemble with a strong sense of faith and goodness.",2014

4,"Well I watched my last episode tonight as I am getting nowhere with this series. Detective Danny has a gut feeling, how good for him he hasn't shown any common sense yet so he must have something. What did it for me was Danny putting his family in harms way, never realizing he has done so with his action. If this is the cop that has to keep us safe, we can do without him. If he puts his family in danger like that not much hope for the rest of us. Episode I saw last with the dead woman in the shower and her daughter unmasking her STEPfather as the killer.

It's overly sentimental, overly sincere, and its belligerently balanced ethical discussions over the bizarrely lauded family dinner sequences are so heavy-handed that they're better suited to a school educational video. The acting is uniformly adequate. Uniformly in the sense that every actor is playing the same constantly sighing humourless bore, and adequate in the sense that you do believe that their characters are supposed to be all of these things.

This is just a cheesy show where Donnie Wahlberg trying to do all macho but never get into trouble for that. The writers should realize that in this era a cop cannot be like that, Verdict:  Script is really bad  Acting is very bad.

At first, I thought that it was just a boring-as-hell cop show -- the pacing is so slow and the dialog so ham-fisted and poorly written it was an easy mistake, but then I realized who this show is for: Christian Republican Aging Baby-Boomers (or as I like to call them, C.R.A.B.s) This show knows its audience of ""the world is going to hell"" gun nuts and will shamelessly pander to them at all costs. The family of cops (the Reagans -- see what the writers did there?) are always on the right side of the law, even when they wave their guns in someone's face to force a confession. I should point out that there are no deep mysteries in this show. The brown people all almost invariably always guilty and the show's biggest twist is often that a white red-blooded American person will occasionally commit crimes. Cops on the show flagrantly abusing their power in the pursuit of justice is the flavor of the day, and anyone who doesn't partake is portrayed as a spineless enabler.",2014

Now over 2 seasons and 14 episodes I like it much more than 24 but fans in the UK should understand that were it NOT for the HUGE success of 24,would there be a strike back series. It would be very hard to unravel the series many plots and sub plots but it revolves around Philip Winchester as Sgt.

The friendship and banter that was shared between Stonebridge and Scott along with the a great series running story line, and brilliant action scenes (both in and out of the bedroom) really worked because it looked natural and real. This season is not off to a great start because they have tried to replicate that exact same team dynamic using different actors who just don't cut the mustard. The cast I am sure in many other roles would be great. Of the now four person bravo team we have a team leader that looks as natural with a rifle in her hands as a fish is out of water, a pair of US and UK Sgt's trying desperately hard to replicate a friendship from seasons 2-5 and it really shows, and an Australian Engineer who is the only one that shows a little promise. ",2017
10,It kept me wanting more and I cared about the characters. It always amazes me how they get these productions to look so authentic. I will certainly recommend it to my friends. I gave it a 10 because it kept me engrossed and I couldn't wait for the next episode. ,2010
10,I have finished the entire series (5 seasons). I will dearly miss this series.,2016
10,"After reading all 3 comments so far I can't understand why your complaining about clichés when many shows if not all use them but to hate a show based on them is nuts, especially after you watched 2 episodes. I have watch 4 episodes and yes there are still clichés but this show is far from bad if fact I find it rather entertaining.",2010
8,"OK so it's pretty much unbelievable, probably isn't half as good as the books (I wouldn't know I haven't read any of them), but if you want fast paced action with hot sexy actors then this is the one for you.",2010
10,I cannot believe so many people hate or just dislike this TV show. In my opinion it is a great show brilliantly put together great cast and well written. Chris Ryan did a great job creating this TV show.,2011
9,"OK, before the Homeland fans go wonky and start posting, let me say that Homeland was a superb soap opera with marvellous acting but as an action series, to quote Don Rickles, watching a fly crawl up a drape is more exciting. And then we have this series. Wow. Not just superb location shots AND superb acting (Richard Armitage steals all his scenes with a rare combination of cunning, trustworthiness and physicality) AND action. Yes, there are subplots and betrayals galore, but the priority is, thankfully, to keep the characters moving forward. Which is what one might have expected in a show about war, albeit a shadowy one with unclear combatants. Superb in first-run, and equally good as a video treat in the present.",2014
7,"Its a bit unbelievable but mostly it delivers fast paced action and decent enough plots. I liked Armitage in this, and so far I have only seen the first 4 episodes of Season 1. Sorry to hear he leaves the series. While it may seem rather unbelievable at times, it has more attention to detail than most TV series with a military theme. I prefer this to any of the US TV shows I have seen recently, as its less over the top that most TV plots these days. ",2011
10,"Filled with Action,bewitching ladies,super hot sex scenes and thrilling suspense Strike Back is essentially the most exhilarating, white-knuckle workplace drama on TV right now. Sure, it helps that the offices of Scott & Stonebridge operate globally out of any location known for housing the more unsavory types in the world – i.e., international terrorists, nuclear-arms dealing businessmen and drug lords. Hope this long last till at-least for 10 seasons..this is the only TV series i enjoy apart from ""Banshee"" (another wonderful series) watching if am seeking for ACTION or Shooting.. love this to the maxxxxxxxx!!!!",2013
10,"Seasons 2 to 5 are excellent, best action series ever!",2017
10,"As i get older, i get pickier about what i watch and i have no patients for under developed TV shows that i loose interest in half way through. Not that i'm a some sort of a hard ass when it comes to watching TV shows, i just like quality over quantity, as do we all (i hope).",2013
8,"No resemblance to Bond, but about as true to Ryan's excellent source novel as a Bond movie. Some changes (nature of Porter's injuries, nature of Hassad's disfigurement) were probably made for budgetary reasons, others to expand the novel into a series.",2010
2,"Show starts out great and Armitage is fantastic in the central roll but bails out after six episodes. One through four are well done but takes big flying (logical) leaps in episodes 5 and 6. These villains make no sense and case hardened operatives make bonehead mistakes and then wonder why it all went wrong. Looks like heavy American influence in second season with EVERY major character bailing out with Mr. Armitage, and lots of sex and nudity to distract you from plot holes, continuity errors and conspiracy theory inspired villains. Some marvelous performances from both regular and quest actors, even more impressive considering the uneven writing.",2011
9,When I take time to watch a show I want to be entertained. The show is entertaining in a wide variety of ways. First the bad though. It is completely implausible that two operators regardless of the skill set would be the 2 Bubba's going out on raids by themselves. There is no such thing as a 2 man direct action plt. On occasion the gals ride along for some back up but it just kind of laughable. The gals I know that are trained up aren't just ride alongside they are active. ,2013
10,I would highly recommend this show to anyone who likes military and spy action into one show this would be the one to watch. ,2013
9,"I LOVE this show, LOVE it, its just the shot in the arm TV needs, its the complete antithesis of most of the other American shows we get here in the UK and its such a welcome contrast.",2011
9,"This show feels like the antidote to all those forensic, gritty, supposedly realistic crime dramas out there today. Hawaii 5-0 2010 is no crime drama, and it's not meant to be. It's also not its father, and anyone looking for a straight remake of the original classic is setting themselves up for disappointment. It's an old-fashioned cop show, the concept updated for today's audience, but with story lines that Starsky & Hutch would be proud of, providing a few more car chases down box-strewn alleyways were thrown in. It's Die Hard for the small screen - John McClane would fit right into the new 5-0 unit, fighting all the terrorist/ninja/crooked cop types that Hawaii seems to be attracting like a magnet. Excellent action sequences, great gun fights, some entertaining relationships developing between the characters, and you know what? Sometimes things just go boom. Pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less.",2011
10,"I was a huge fan of the original Hawaii Five-O, so when I heard about this attempt at a new show, I was excited but skeptical at the same time. Would it be just another CSI, or would it be different? Would it deserve to be called 'Hawaii Five-O'? Well, I must say...",2010
1,"My wife and I really liked Five-0 but the last episodes have been really stinky. Freeing the elephant? (fake CGI elephant!) was terrible. I said to my wife what will the crazy PETA-type radicals want next? To take our pets? And sure enough within a week I saw a story that PETA wants to ""free"" all ""captive"" animals. Then the crazy ""run through the jungle"" chase with Hannibal eating the bad guys! And now the last episode makes SCREAM look like Oscar material. Minutes of nothing but psychotic, paranoid, hacker takes over the home electronics? The show used to have a good stories of difficult plot lines that made examples of good police work and tie ins with Hawaiian culture. Now it just sucks.",2016
1,"An abomination. Whoever came up with the crazy idea of trying to make what is basically a conventional cops-and-robbers shoot 'em up blow'em up show special by linking it to one of the classiest shows ever produced should have his membership card in the scriptwriters union revoked. Did they think the nostalgia factor would attract new viewers? Why call the two leads Steve McGarrett and Danny Williams when their age, appearance, mannerisms, behavior, and above all their relationship bear no resemblance whatsoever to Jack Lord and James MacArthur? Why change the sex of Kono? Why include an abbreviated version of the original theme music? Hawaii is an exotic backdrop for any show but the original Hawaii Five-0 introduced it naturally as the action took us from the mansions of Kahala to the slums of King Street and to such places as the campus of the university, Kapiolani Park, the Iolani Palace, the Punchbowl Cemetery, and the hotels of Waikiki. The new version just gives us periodic quick flashes of scenery some of which look like they are not real shots but artificially created ones. Finally, there was the plot of the new show, - confusing, conventional, and not comparable to the thoughtful, suspenseful plots of the original that dealt with such issues as the theft of art work, espionage, child kidnapping, and con jobs performed on servicemen enjoying R & R from Vietnam. I remember with particular pleasure the the three part series on the Vashon crime family and the attempts of first Harold Gould as the father and then Luther Adler as the grandfather to destroy McGarrett because of the death of the grandson. There were great guest stars too, including Hal Holbrook, Ed Asner, Hume Cronyn, and even Helen Hayes. The original Hawaii Five-0 was unique. I resent the attempt to use it to gussy up an otherwise conventional show that on its own might not last a year.",2010
1,"So corny. Danno story? What kid tries to say their dad's first name before learning daddy? McGarret shows up and the governor just gives him carte blanche to do whatever the hell he wants no matter if it is legal or not? Beating a prisoner to get information out of him? Other guy is kicked out of police force because they say he took bribes, but he says he didn't then McGarret just let's him back in? Guy who's been convicted of taking bribes has a cousin who is now in the police force? How could she pass a background check if her cousin had been kicked off the force for taking bribes? My ten year old daughter could write better stories than this. I bet money that one of the story lines down the road is where Danno's ex-wife's husband turns out to be some kind of crime figure and Danno busts him and get's his wife back.....Watch and see, I won't be watching...",2010
4,"This remake is fine, in theory, yet the story-line is completely unbelievable. The idea that an active duty Naval officer (SEAL) can simply depart the Navy whenever he feels like it is truly beyond reality. The idea that the Governor can simply make this guy a gun-toting police officer with zero police training or procedural knowledge is laughable. The idea that a police academy cadet can simply punch out a fellow surfer with impunity is pure insanity. Sure, the show had some funny or interesting moments - but it goes way beyond suspension of dis-belief into the realm of WTF? From the very beginning of the show it screamed silly - I don't hold out hope for much better as it goes along.",2010
3,"I was not a major fan of the original 50, but spent enough years in Hawaii to appreciate its cast, their relationship and the many places that make Hawaii unique and Hawaii. The current cast of actors seem so out of place, and so vanilla like so many other shows that there is nothing special about this show. Throw in a few mispronounced names and places and you have a cop show in Hawaii? Don't think so in my opinion--- which is what a review of course is. Others may have liked it, but I give few shows a 3, but I will say for lack of character interaction, very bad plot lines, and little of what makes Hawaii unique in a show about Hawaii. What is it with 3 day old growth that seems to make a hard nosed guy so hard nosed and tough? Where is the grown up directing traffic for this group? I like far out plot lines with the rest (big fan of the far out Burn Notice), but a haole from the mainland is your star hacker--- locals weren't available? Plane comes in and no backup emergency power for the tower and you don't think the military would have jets scrambling in minutes--- planes are tracked across the Pacific. So little plot development, yes the show is early in its inception and delivery, but there is a history and local flavor that could have been added to the show. There are some good cop shows out there, unique plots and places, unfortunately unless the writing and poor direction on this show improves quickly, this will not be around to be one of them.",2010
7,"Let's start with arguably the best and most recognized TV score of all time. If the producers want to use the original theme song, then why shorten it? It reminded me of the truncated TV tunes of re-runs in syndication.",2010
10,"The new reboot of Hawaii Five-0 is first rate from start to finish. The fresh takes on the original characters are a breath of fresh air. It's very interesting having the tension between McGarrett & Williams. The idea of making Kono a girl is also a great idea. The Hawaii locations look great in high-def and it's interesting to see how much Hawaii has grown since the original series went off the air. It's a great cast and so far the story lines are very good. The only thing missing is the persistent over-acting from Jack Lord, but that's a good thing. If you never watched the original series, give this one a chance. If you were a fan of the original, you won't be disappointed at all. It's great to have the series back on TV and I can't wait to see where the new producers and writers take us. Book 'em Dano!",2010
1,"OK, I have to say first off that I like a ton of people was a huge fan of the original. Does that taint my opinion of the remake.....it could but I tend to give a few kicks at the can of remakes from my memories hoping that I can find magic again. A good example is Galactica where the remake was actually better than the original.",2010
10,"I can't say enough good about this show and its actors. All four of the major characters were well chosen and show a great range of emotions, allowing for considerable character development. In one episode, we learn more about where all four of them than we did in the original series from 1968-80. Their acting ability and range would allow for big screen versions of the show.",2010
1,"Too much action...no substance. Typical network re-make: (1) use name(s), title, and theme; (2) use standard action formula and hack writers. Formula: Show horrible murder is committed by someone (or group) who are too much for the Hawaiian Police. Governor calls an unofficial Five-O in (yeah right, how many governors have this kind of time). The Five-O team, which apparently only has to work occasionally, assembles from their diverse personal enjoyments. A laptop accesses unbelievable resources. Grace Parks dresses sexy. Unshaven Alex O'Loughlin shows off tattoos. Civil rights are violated en-masse. Crooks and henchmen suddenly become stupid and are taken down by 2, 3 or 4 members of Five-O. ""Book'em Danno"". The stories (sic) are full of holes and mostly unbelievable. Cartoons generally go better than this. If this is what the public wants/likes today, my condolences. Leonard Freeman and Jack Lord are turning over in their graves. Prediction: 1 season at best...followed by the new ""Law and Order: Hawaii"" where we see every one of these cases thrown out of court.",2010
10,"I was around for the original series, although I was only about 5 or 6 at the time, but I still watched it with my folks and liked the original series. Now as I look back, I find that the original I can't even watch anymore... how the times have changed.",2010
5,"So the original series was a crime drama about a state police unit designated 50, headed by former naval officer and police officer, Steve McGarrett, whose second in command, Danny Willams was also a close friend. The new series has the same title, opening theme, character names and the fact that McGarrett was in the navy. That's it - the only similarities. The new series is an action series about a sanctioned vigilante unit headed by a current naval officer on a vendetta, and he and his second actively dislike each other. They even changed one of the original male characters into a female character, as in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. (Hey, wait, Grace Park was in Battlestar Galactica and is in this new Hawaii Five-0, too. Things that make you go hmmm...) Anyway, if you remember the original series - don't expect it here. Which doesn't mean it's bad, exactly, it's actually pretty good. Just...not the same. And...more violent. If that's your bag, fine. I like action and I'll keep watching, but if you wanted the original crime drama, go elsewhere.",2010
1,"When has a sequel approached or surpassed the brilliance of the original concept? Rarely, in fact I cannot think of a single instance. But seriously, when you make a sequel you should at least be a fan...force the writers to watch a season of DVDs so they at least have a clue. This is SO bad I don't even want to waste time on writing this intelligently.",2013
2,"The Remake of the theme song is the only reason to see this idiotically, godawful, disjointed remake of the great 1968-80 television classic, Alex McLoughlin delivers a very bad performance, the rest of the actors are woeful, scott cann is embarrassing, the rest of the scenes are just so pointless, the action is over the top, the writing is embarrassing, the teleplay is a mess and the only things that save this disasters are the beautiful scenery of Hawaii, the theme songs and the cinematography, otherwise this is a pointless, useless exercise in stupidity that deserves to be on my list of the worst TV of 2010.",2010
2,"I was very disappointed with this new sequel of Hawaii Five O. Poor Jack Lord must be spinning in his grave. This new show's writers have obviously never had any contact with any real law enforcement agencies. The two protagonists look like a pair of skid row bums badly in need of a shave. The only time you would look like this in real life is when you went under cover. This new show is some clueless writer's fantasy of what an elite arm of LE should look like. The show's plots are too sophomoric and inane. It's too much CGI and special effects, and the banter is straight out of high school. The grade school set should love this new incarnation. Any resemblance to real life law enforcement is purely coincidental. CBS shouldn't let any modicum of reality interfere with this new offering. If they did it might cause enough interest for more of us to then watch it. Having been in LE most of my life I therefore give this show a big two thumbs down for a huge lack of credibility. Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick.",2010
1,"The Show is weak in script, Scott Caan is their because of his father, not a good Dano, Alex O'Loughin is a extremely weak Steve Mc Garrett, no leadership in the show, it looks like Dano is his boss. The Scripts are very bad, too short intro very cheesy graphics. The stories are all over the place. Grace park and Daniel Dee Kim should play the main roles, don't waist your time watch this very poorly made show. The show is made very poor, where is Jack Lord when we need him. The people who made this show never watched the old Hawaii 5-0, skip this show its really bad. CBS must be shooting this show on a shoe string. Avoid this show at all costs, watch the old Hawaii 5-0 show's if you really want to watch a good Hawaii 5-0 show",2015
4,"Firstly, I'll identify myself, as every reviewer should: I'm a 56 year-old who was a fan of the old show. So I'm n going to inevitably view the new show from that perspective. If I were a 20 year old who didn't know there was an old show, I'm sure my perspective would be quite different.",2010

7,"Love this show! I was a fan of Alex O'Loughlin in Moonlight (guilty pleasure), and he's just delicious in this; cool, calm and collected, fast, good with a gun and awesome looking in uniform. Add to that, brilliant other characters in this Hawaii-50 remake including the iconic Danno (Scott Caan) and also lovely and determined Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) and gorgeous and kick-ass Kono (Grace Park). Each episode is part of a larger story arc but is an exciting and gripping adventure or case, where the bad guys are brought down, they often go undercover and use technology, contacts, and a few good smack downs to get what they need done. The scripts aren't always A1 but the dialogue is sufficient and often funny, but without the over-cheesy CSI lines that make you want to throw things at the TV, and it's not predictable or overly stylised with set pieces. There's also great stunts and car chases, it's exciting television that isn't mindless or pointless. It's also nice because despite the violence, it's not gratuitous in other ways and is good (older) family entertainment set in beautiful Hawaii with gorgeous vistas and scenery, beaches and surfing; pretty good advertising for the island actually!",2013
8,"I have never seen an episode of the original 'Hawaii Five-O' (although I will certainly give it a go if it is ever repeated on television) so I have no preconceptions of what to expect with this rebooted version. However, I do love American cop shows and have been looking forward to this since I first heard it was being produced. For those unfamiliar with the premise, the show is set in Hawaii and centres on a newly formed police unit consisting of ex-Navy SEAL Steve McGarrett, New Jersey detective Danny Williams (who has grudgingly moved to Hawaii to be with his young daughter), wrongly disgraced Hawaiian detective Chin Ho Kelly and his rookie cousin Kono Kalakaua (who, apparently, was a guy in the 1970s version but is played by Grace Park in this version).",2011
3,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this show the first few seasons. All of the characters were well developed and each brought a uniquely funny and quirky personality to the show. Molly was the most sane female in her family, yet she was likable and incredibly funny. This season (beginning Fall, 2013) Molly has turned into a completely different character, and unfortunately, at least as far as my boyfriend and I are concerned, she isn't at all likable and is most definitely not funny. We still watch the show each week, and hope that she'll go back to being the old Molly from seasons past. Luckily, the other characters maintained their original personalities and we still have some good laughs when they get some dialogue. A woman who was stable and teaching children for the first few seasons and all of the sudden turns into a woman who jumps out of her classroom window in front of her students because she wants to be a writer is not at all the type of woman Molly used to be. She was witty and smart; now it seems she's lost her intelligence. The show used to have stories for all of the characters...now it just focuses on Molly and what sort of mess she'll get into and out of within the 30 minute time slot. It seems as though she's aiming to be a modern Lucille Ball. Sadly, she really misses the mark and we miss the old Molly.",2013
8,"I enjoyed watching ""Mike and Molly"" very much. Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy lead a superb cast while delving into a rather touchy subject. Let me say uncandidly my wife and I both deal with weight problems, and for the first time I felt the issues were centered without being insulting. The jokes are ""laugh with me"" style rather then ""laugh at me"". Needless to say, dealing with these issues can make a person self conscious, and we see that portrayed in Mike as he is smitten with Molly (and I can certainly see why) but hesitates to make the move to ask her out.",2010
3,"What started out as a nice RomCom jumped the shark. Not sure who decided to do the ""NEW Mike & Molly"" but the new stinks. It used to be an enjoyable show about a couple who just happen to be overweight and their quirky friends and relatives. Now it's about a angry fat woman who just keeps doing more outrageous things in her desire for attention. Hey, writers did you notice how NONE of Melissa's movies have been anywhere near blockbusters? Might be a clue.",2013
2,"Was there a plan in the works for, 'Mike and Molly,' to fail? If there was – one word – success. The show started out very funny and got un-funny real quick. Mike and Milly seemed like a likable couple bumbling through life - like all of us. At least that was at first, (and actually Billy Gardell still seems like a amiable kind of dude.) What the heck happened to Molly? It's like she has become the devil's spawn. She is horrible. It is sad that such a promising show found the edge of the toilet and decided to dive in head-first. All of this almost seemed like it was by design. I can only assume that the writers were told to tank the program. They have done such a good job, I doubt we will have to suffer through a reunion show - phew. Anyways – I hope the network can come up with something funny – I don't care if it is original or not, I just want something funny, that is all.",2014

With another hit The Big Bang Theory, he joins Paul Henning and Susan Harris as the only producers to have three sitcoms in prime time. ",2010
7,"When the show first started i could not get enough of it. i loved everyone in the show. Loved we was getting this chance to watch a couple meet and fall in love and what not. Filled with tons of great jokes and moments. Well up until the past current season where Molly quits her job to find her self. Once that happened the show became all about Molly, like every episode was about Molly doing something that made no sense at all. Like how can you quit your job when your up to your neck in debt and are trying to have a child. I didn't like how also everything became Mike fault and he was played as the bad guy. The jokes that Melissa McCarthy are saying are just lame and sounds like she trying to hard. This bugged me so much i stopped watching the show and never finished the rest of the season. I hope for one day for it to go back to the way it was.",2014
9,"I stumbled on this show watching reruns on a channel which shows only reruns and I caught the first two episodes and thought they were extremely funny. What especially attracted me to the show is the fact that the cast is more or less half white and half black . I did not grow up in the States and before I came here , that is how I always imagined it to be. All races living happily together and being friends. Not the reality unfortunately. ",2015
5,"I watched episodes 3 & 4. I really tried to like it because I like some of the people in it, but it comes across as a re-wash of the same old sitcoms of days past. The kind of humor that practically says, ""Here's a joke...Laugh."" instead of being clever and surprising. In fact I really think the jokes themselves are basically re-hashed from other sitcoms....Or at least the set up to them is. I guess there's an audience for this same old sitcom format, but it's not for me.",2010
2,OK I have seen 2 episodes(1 from older seasons and a recent episode) they both had cheesy jokes I did laugh once watching these there seems to me that the suggested laughs are just sprinkled in at times when I wouldn't have even known something was meant to be funny! There are quite a few sitcoms out there today and the only one that really has comedy which is the Big Bang Therory. If you compare these two the Big Bang Therory is much funnier and smarter(there jokes aren't all about fat jokes). And you cant compare 90s sitcoms such as Seinfeld that are so much funnier then them both!,2015

3,"I started with the pilot episode, and I really like the promise of that episode. Then came episode 2 and shortly after all the others where the screen writing seems to have gone from lovingly and witty - to fat jokes and the normal relationship hysteria that surrounds the airing shows. I hate it when you first describe two people as mature and wise - just to transform them into stupid people who can't read the others signals at all. The thing that the couple is fat were adoring at first, now it just feels like an excuse to fire up under the puns and squeeze a few laughs out of the viewers.",2011
10,"I love this show!I wasn't sure how it would work out. People have such preconceived notions about fat people that they could/would/might/ shy away from this show. Fat and thin alike. I hope you don't. This show is really very witty and uber-entertaining. Mike and Molly are fat people who know they are fat and yet are still comfortable with who they are. Not even most thin people I know can say that. M&M know that being overweight isn't the best thing for a body to be, so they address in every show the Overeaters' Anonymous angle giving the value of a healthy lifestyle it's due. I think that that's an important part of the entire story. However, just as important is the fact that these two fat people are confident, well-spoken, easy-going, comfortable-in-their-own-skin kind of people. Because of that, they are sexy. Nothing is more compelling that self-confidence. I think the writers and crew are trying to show that. If they're not, that's what they are showing - even if it is by accident. These two actors are confident in who they are and that bleeds into their characters throughout. They easily laugh at themselves in a fondly deprecating manner and are no fools to their shortcomings, but they don't apologize for who they are either. Right On! ",2010

2,"If you ever find yourself wishing for an old-fashioned TV sitcom, the kind they used to make back in the day, remember: Be careful what you wish for--you may get something like ""Mike and Molly,"" a new sitcom that is reminiscent of one of those old summer replacement shows of the '70s, or one of the countless shows that the Fox network presented in its fledgling days, only to be canceled weeks later. The show revolves around (no pun intended) two morbidly obese singles, played by Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy, and their budding romance. The show has been touted as some kind of noble attempt to give equal time to the lives and loves of imperfect people, in this case overweight people. Well, that's great. And how does the show do this? With fat jokes. This reminded me of those Norman Lear sitcoms which supposedly poked fun at stereotypes by reinforcing them with stale, offensive jokes.",2010

How does the network approve of this and find it funny? How do the actors even say some of these things? I understand, it's all art. People can say and do what they want. But this was more offensive than even funny. this stuff isn't appropriate at all, and definitely not for prime time television. I'm off to find another comedy show.",2013

7,"This is an enjoyable series, but the initial blurb made me think overeating would be a major plot point, but besides being the reason why Mike and Molly met and being a topic in a couple of earlier episodes, it doesn't feature much any more.",2014
2,I watched 20 or so episodes before I could stand it no more. The show is not funny. I hoped they would get rid of the mother and sister after the first season-nope! They just spout vulgar one-liners and it would be a better show without them. They should let the two stars write some episodes maybe it would work better.,2012
6,"When this show started I really liked it. It was funny and entertaining. I liked the banter between Mike, Carl, and Samuel. Samuel's dry, witty comments are a real laugh. This has continued through out the series to my delight. Molly's character has changed as the show progressed. When she quit her teaching job to become a writer it seemed like she was taking over the series over several episodes. I did not care for that at all. Things have again balanced out and I am happier. Swoosie Kurtz plays Molly's mother whose house they all live in. She is a very funny booze hound with a bit of a sarcastic wit. Along with Molly's sister who is the hot pot head working as the make up artist at a funeral home and after a few episodes, Vince who becomes Swoosie's husband they all live together is blissful disharmony. I like Vince's character as he lends a certain earthiness to the whole show. Then there is Carl's Grandmother who I find to be extremely funny. She lays it down like it is. Mike's mother is played well but her character is a very bitter, unloving (on the surface) person who loves her scruffy dog more than anyone else. I hope this show stays on the air for a few more years, as long as it stays funny.",2014
10,This is one of the only shows that I cannot wait to watch I absolutely love it. I love Melissa McCarthy because she is absolutely beautiful and talented and Billy Gardel is also very talented in this show. Whoever does not like this show does not have taste and whoever has a bad thing to say shouldn't say anything at all! I would also like to say that the other actors in this show are very talented and the writers should be proud of themselves because this is a top notch show !!! All I have to say now is that make sure there is more than one series of this show because simply it is the best and I absolutely love it and I am sure I am not the only one :),2010
10,"Go Victoria! The show contains some of the most real to life characters. You can relate to or know someone who does relate, reminds you of... characters. Great Comedy, a true gem to CBS. The writing team are true geniuses, Keep it coming!! Every character adds the perfect mix to the cast. The Love Story of Mike & Molly is heartfelt,many can relate when you are in the first stages of meeting your significant others friends and family and their real world and what makes them who they are.",2010
10,"I absolutely cannot get enough of this show. I am so tired of all the reality shows out there. I enjoy sitting back and watching shows that are not politically correct. If I see one more PC show, I will vomit. Mike and Molly are great and I think TV has been waiting for a show like this for a long time. Every character has something to give in this hit. What may be trash to others is a treasure for me. The jokes are great and the cast is likable. What else can you ask for? It is not a show for the overly sensitive, since some of the jokes are more personal, but who cares? It's funny and more real than most other shows out there now.",2010
7,"""She's out of My League"" is a solid 7, a romantic comedy that scores a few good laughs and does a nice job of being convincing. Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) stars as Kirk, a pathetic dork with the build of Woody Allen who works a menial job in airport security. Through a cell-phone mishap, he winds up at a party being thrown by Molly (Alice Eve), a 10 on the very attractive scale. He knows she's way more attractive than him and she knows he's normally not the guy she would usually date but Molly looks deep down and sees Kirk for the nice, unthreatening guy he is and they hit it off. There are some funny moments here. Kirk's family is especially demeaning to him (they even embrace his bitchy ex-girlfriend as one of their own) and his friends are clueless match-makers, which leads to a very funny man-scaping scene between Kirk and one of them. What works best in ""League"" is just listening to people talk though. Kirk's friends (played by Mike Vogel, Nate Torrance, and T.J Miller) are identifiable idiots, too wrapped up in over-thinking things like the rating scale (both their number and womens) and Disney fairy-tales to really understand women. Their scenes with Kirk are enjoyably like a crude, vulgar, sexual ""Breakfast Club"". The way the scrawny, nervous, and unconfident Baruchel interacts with the beautiful and engaging Eve is also very likable and they do a nice job of handling the ups and downs of forming an honest, meaningful relationship (an almost foreign concept in today's star-packaged romantic comedies). The way they finally handle the elephant in the room is also very effective. This is feel-good stuff, but it works.",2010
7,"Expectations weren't exactly through the roof for SOOML. No big name actors, a director with no feature film experience and a screenplay by the same guys who brought us Sex Drive. It is with great delight then, that what we get is 100 minutes of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. Is it clichéd? Sure is. We've seen the 'underdog gets the girl' story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality.",2010
7,"(Synopsis) Molly (Alice Eve) is a sexy event planner who is delayed by a sleazy airport security guard. Another security guard, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) comes to her rescue, and passes her through to catch her plane. Luckily, Kirk finds Molly's phone that she left behind, and from the plane, Molly calls her phone and invites Kirk to a party to return her phone when she returns. Kirk is smitten by Molly, but his friends point out to him that he doesn't have a chance, because he is only rated as a ""5"" and Molly is definitely a ""10"". And as everybody knows, you can only date a girl who is only ""2"" above your score, so that means Kirk can only successfully date a ""7"". However, Molly has something else in mind, because she has found that Kirk is sweet, amusing, honest, and different from the men she has been dating. Kirk, on the other hand, has one big insecurity problem; Kirk believes Molly will dump him as soon as she realizes her mistake. Under these circumstances, and everything working against Kirk and Molly, is it possible for them to build a relationship that will bloom and flourish? ",2010

To me, the commercials did not look very promising, and when it was compared to the hangover in one ad, I really wasn't expecting much. First of all, when I went to see the hangover, I was ready to laugh like crazy due to how funny everyone said it was. Personally, I didn't find it very funny at all and I always felt the writers/actors were trying too hard make a joke out of everything. The only thing that kept my attention was the semi-interesting plot.",2010
8,"I went into the early screening of this movie tonight with low expectations, having not heard much about the movie, nor seen any trailers. I was floored! The cast is great in their parts and the script is hilarious. If you like any of the Judd Apatow films (I don't think he was a part of this movie, but it is the same kind of humor) then you will like this one. Fans of Knocked Up will recognize Jay BarucheI who plays the awkward lead with weak self esteem, and he is as cute as ever. I also had a chance to meet the lovely Alice Eve, who attended the screening and she was very nice and very beautiful. I hope to see more of her in the future. While this wasn't Shakespeare, it was a great laugh and very fun to see with friends.",2010

2,"This movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called ""hard 10"" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. Goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Done with tirade.",2010

One of those ""you saw the funny parts in the trailer"" movies. But still, I saw the movie just keeping my expectations low as most romantic comedies are just awful. Much to my pleasant surprise, She's Out of My League was a really funny movie that I enjoyed very much. In a society obsessed with looks and being perfect, most romantic comedies have these gorgeous people in the leads who don't look like they need any help in their love lives, we finally get a lead who isn't drop dead gorgeous as for Hollywood standards getting a beautiful person. Though I do wish we could have a romantic comedy with the opposite, not so hot girl gets the hot guy, I guess we'll have to wait a while for that. But She's Out of My League does deliver in the laughs and entertainment with great chemistry with our two leads and supporting cast.",2010

There are so many films out there that are just like this and they are so very untrue to real life, sure thats what movies are for (getting away from real life) but this film tries to make it true to life and fails, it has mediocre acting, poor character development and it the only reason i gave it 1 out of 10 (not the fact i cant give it 0 out of 10) but the fact that it has some mildly funny moments, which were the only things that kept me from getting out of my seat and walking out of the cinema.",2010

The difference between this and many like it is this movie is actually pretty funny. It's not afraid to be a little bit and some very raunchy.

6,"Being a reader of the book this show was a great excitement for me. I was extremely surprised to see it being made but it was a happy surprise for they where making it the right way, in a mini series not a movie, a movie would have been horrendous and ruined the whole thing. That being said I went ahead and viewed the entire series from start to finish. To begin, the actors that played all the parts were absolutely fantastic, they were exactly what i was led to believe when i read the book to perfection. The story was not to far stretched from the truth and I was not entirely disappointed. However with this being a miniseries i was to believe that they would have kept the story as the author had wrote it, a master piece, while this show is good it is by no means a masterpiece. The story that they tell in this show does not stray to far out of line until the last 3-4 episodes. Then it becomes a great a reckless attempt at making a show more on a budget then on what the author created. There was no Richard going to the crusades for the king in the book he went because he killed Alfred for raping Aliena. There was not incest subplot between William and his mother. Williams wife did have a child but because she was so young when she did was unable to bear another. William became sheriff much sooner. William killed a bishop and thats why he was hanged not for some accident. The list goes on and on. If the creators of this miniseries had simply followed the book and extended the series a little bit then maybe they could have made a better show. All this being said, as i stated before, I was not entirely dissatisfied with the show. It was good in its own way. It was simply a disappointment to not see so many stories told by Follet that were either misrepresented or not represented at all. All in all its a good statement of what the book was sort of about but because of the so many eliminated plot lines and characters I ended the series thinking.. That kinda sucked. If your into swords medieval times and ways of thinking this series is for you. If your a strong supporter of the book not so much. As always this is simply my opinion and i am perhaps too in favor of keeping written things in there true form. Please make your own opinions, perhaps watching the series will prompt you to read the book, if so then the series has accomplished something better then itself..",2010
8,"Set in England during medieval times, this is a fictional account of what happens after a dying king's proper heir dies in a shipwreck. There are many characters(including a family that seek to construct a grand cathedral, two siblings who lose their nobility and try to regain it, and several men of God with more or less pure intentions and granted, not everyone is actually necessary) and a lot of plot, and it can be dizzying at first, but it is worth your attention(if you like what you see early on it ain't gonna change). While I have not read the novel and can make no comparisons, I watched this with two people who love it and they both said that it wasn't the exact same and that they still enjoyed it a lot. This is gripping right off the bat, and it keeps to an intense pace throughout. There are many developments, and while it can at times come off as just going back and forth between the same couple of options, you tend to follow them with interest surpassing that of the best banks. The tension and suspense are great. This has good and well-delivered dialog, with many memorable lines(and razor-sharp points about what it was like back then). The exploration of the awful situations that people could be and were stuck in back then, on account of the system, religion and their lack of rights is excellent and chilling. This is realistic(a lot of the way), authentic and has an incredible richness of detail. The strong feminist behavior of the women in this would not have been tolerated as we see here. This has mostly credible psychology, including for the villains(if one or two are black and white in depiction). The acting, writing and direction are marvelous, and the music is as well. This has amazing production values. No one is sacred, anyone could die at any time in this. The twists and unexpected turns of events keep you guessing how it will end, and it is fairly satisfying. There are power struggles, deception, politics and manipulation aplenty. This does seem to think itself Shakespeare at times, using effects right out of Macbeth and Hamlet. There is dramatic license leading to things that couldn't happen happening. This has some humor. There is some action, and it works well. You can tell this was executive produced by the Scott brothers. The atmosphere is fitting, this always builds the right mood. This can be called a soap opera to some extent, though I would classify it as one of the better ones. Redmayne is a Christian Bale wannabe once he starts talking(he does thankfully refrain from the pitiful Eastwood impersonation). There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of blood and violence, sexuality, nudity and a little strong language(largely it isn't gratuitous). I recommend this to any fan of epics. 8/10",2011
5,"To explain why this television series is a disappointment, it suffices to compare with historical reality the outline of events depicted in just the first few minutes. We begin with a brief depiction of the White Ship, with English King Henry I's only son and heir and his wife on board, going down in fictitious flames ""off the coast of England"". Actually, it struck a rock just off the coast of Normandy and the prince's wife was far away. The King is dismissive of the promise of his little daughter Maud (actually then a married adult living faraway in Germany) to provide him with heirs, while his unhistorically wicked nephew Stephen (whose real decency is well-known as his undoing) plots his own succession. We then flash forward to 1138 when Henry I (actually already dead for three years) celebrates the birth in Winchester of Maud's son Henry (actually born five years earlier in France) as his prospective heir. The old king then promptly drops dead of a poisoning that has no basis of suspicion in reality and his grieving daughter (actually then in France and at war with her father) narrowly escapes abroad.",2015

5,"I have not read the book and mainly watched this as a fan of many of the actors and as a historian. I am perfectly willing to allow that an author can take liberties with history in order to make an engaging story that works in a mini-series. However, that is no excuse for getting basic facts just wrong. Many of the royals were grossly mischaracterized, either as idiots, monsters, or both. Prince Eustace, for example, was not some craven boy but notorious for quite the opposite, and Prince Henry did not kill Eustace in battle. Stephen was not involved in any plots to murder Prince William or Henry I. Maud was empress because she married the Holy Roman Emperor, not because she took the title on a whim. Mistakes in basic monastic and village life were endless. It all got quite ridiculous. I hope no one watching this series believes that any of this supposed history was accurate. I enjoyed the story as a story, though I thought the bad guys were rather cartoonish in their evil. The cast was terrific, and made what was rather a soap opera into something much better. Kudos go especially to Tony Curran as Stephen, Natalia Wörner as Ellen, and Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder. So, if you like a good drama, this is fun and over the top. If you like history, this isn't it.",2011
4,"The good news is it's over. A formula miniseries that manages to be confusing, boring and historically inaccurate. Spoilers Follow. I don't have a problem with the time compression - that there was 15 years between the drowning of the prince and the death of the original king. I do have a problem that half the series was spent building King Stephen into a type of ogre only to have him essentially removed from the script in the final two episodes. I know King Stephen was a lousy king and that he adopted Henry II to make a successful and peaceful transition after his death, but why was none of this mentioned? And although Rufus Sewell is supposedly the creative star of the series the final church construction ignores anything he contributed. But the fatal dramatic flaw is everything is resolved in the last 40 minutes of this massive and turgid melodrama. The bad guys all die, the good guys almost all win, and events that were unexplained remained unexplained. This was a mediocre series and the reason for the high rating was over TV this summer was even more boring.",2010

Ian McShane plays the ""baddie"" with relish but no great depth. Donald Sutherland plays Donald Sutherland and sticks out like a sore thumb. The female leads are all unconvincing as medieval women - behaving with 21st century manners and mores. Strange that the Scotts were involved with this since I liked Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood.

Ian McShane is wasted in this and he is the best actor in it. All the female characters are strong forceful women, this led me to notice there were no female menials, no scullery maids, ladies in waiting or the like. the towns also are about as intelligent as those in Monty Python's Holy Grail. all in all skip it.",2010
5,"First I must say that until the last episode this was enjoyable viewing and probably an 8. It has a good mix of action, intrigue, love, lust and evil doings to make for an engaging story. There are some very good performances especially David Oakes. BUT, the final episode was as flat as a pancake. It was if the producers had been left too much to cover in the final installment and had to keep to budget, resulting in a very clumsy conclusion. This is in addition to what seems to be the imperative for US productions that at the denouement, the whole plot has to be spelled out in words of less than two syllables. Every villain declares their hand and has to explain the what and why fores of their evil machinations. So much so it is more like a stage farce unraveling than a medieval epic turning full circle. If the director had left the viewer something to think about it would have provided a far more memorable impression. Finally, why oh why does the villain always begin his attempted escape on terra firma and yet feels compelled to find a tall building to be chased up only in order to fall off?",2010

Production and acting is OK, but the story and the way the viewer is manipulated is unworthy of a 12 year old.

One of the episodes I viewed was an entire evening spent yelling at each other. I really feel sorry for them. Occasionally you see the actions of a real person shine through, but it's rare. I don't understand why anyone would want to watch a bunch of sad people with low self-esteems be cruel to each other all day. I think all of those women need to go on a spiritual retreat, leaving their designer bags and make-up behind before they spend their last day on Earth thinking, ""What did I do with my life?""",2011

It must be excruciating to try to look and dress like an 18 year old when 50! It is all down hill from here for these girls. This show reminds me of professional wrestling. (Although this might be an insult to professional wrestling). With all the over the top outfits and fake fighting. I mean come on! These petty snipes and self centered bickering cannot be real. Right? I would love to see a spoof on one the networks just go for it. Over the top drag queens yearning for their youth. Queens who never matured emotionally, striking a chord in the archetypal collective heart, longing for youth and empathy; yet just cannot give any empathy to anyone and I mean ever! Wishing, if only I could just be 18 again. I could really get into that show. This one, I do not think I can stomach anymore. This show is achingly bad!",2013
1,This show and especially Carlton need to be put in the trash! Enough already! The women are offensive and do nothing but bicker and spend money shamelessly . Their husbands are worse as they stand by and watch the insanity. Brandi should be locked up and her mouth sewed shut! David Foster - SHAME ON YOU ! You should be smarter than this . Bravo has THE BEST SHOW in TOP CHEF . Why pollute the channel with RHBH and Van Der Plump Rules ( an even WORSE travesty) when you can have quality shows such as Top Chef? I don't get it? The show is bordering on disgusting this year . Will not be watching as it is too offensive and boring.,2014
4,INTRODUCTION ,2014
9,I have followed every city's version of the Real Housewives franchise and believe this is the most intriguing and addicting of the franchise thus far. ,2011
8,"I have to say that I like the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Of course, they are plastic but they appear likable. Let's start off with Adrienne Maloof who is married to a plastic surgeon and her family owns the Sacramento Kings basketball team and the Palms Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas. Then there is her neighbor and friend, British Lisa Vanderpump, who is married and they are business owners and entrepreneurs as well. Lisa has a gay trainer who moved from London to be with the family. They have two grown children. Then there is the sisters, Kim Richards and Kyle Richards, who were both actresses in the seventies and eighties. They became mothers and housewives. Each one has four children. Kyle is married and younger than Kim but acts more like the big sister than Kim does. Kim and Kyle are also maternal aunts to Paris Hilton as well. Then there is Taylor and of course, Camille Grammar, who is Kelsey Grammar's soon to be ex-wife. They are in the process of divorce. We only see Kelsey in the first episode before he jets to New York City to star on Broadway in La Cages Aux Folles. I prefer this show to NJ of course even though I live in NJ. At least, these housewives have some class, more money, and look fabulous than the other shows. They have just as much drama and are appealing too.",2010
7,I like this show its fun but I am also not a fan of all these women. Season 7 to me has been the most interesting season since season 1.,2017
6,"Initially I liked this show when I first turned it on. The mix of characters is interesting, and finding out about their lives was fun. Once they got together, the usual snide comments surfaced, and they all seem to like and dislike each other in equal proportions. The big mansions pall after awhile, and there is nothing in these women's lives that anyone would be jealous of. Only two seemed to have a stable marriage. The others were either divorced, teetering, or in the process, and one candidly admitted that hers was in trouble. I'll take my little house and my family over theirs anytime. I liked most of them, and I am reserving judgment on the others for now. If this turns into another debacle like New York or Atlanta, count me out, and don't mention New Jersey. Just the commercials for that make me cringe. All in all, it's not a great show, but it's entertaining, and certainly the best of the Housewife franchises. If you want to see bad manners, lavish homes, jewelry, and appalling plastic surgery this is your show. The woman with the weird mouth and too many teeth,looks like a clown, and not in a good way. If you like junk TV, this is your show. Masterpiece Theater it isn't, but it never aspired to be that. Take it for what it is, and take it or leave it. This one will probably be my guilty pleasure. For all that's wrong with it, there is a lot right with it. Most of them are likable and/or entertaining. Will I watch it every week? No, but then I don't eat chocolate every week either!",2010
1,"There are many smart, talented, and wonderful women, who are beautiful inside and out-- those women ARE NOT featured on these programs. My wife insists on playing these shows early in the morning on reruns and listening to bitches scream insults at each other for some reason. ",2017
10,"This is the best reality, docu-drama show on TV. The reason I say this is, it seems to actually be real. The women on this show have their petty fights and spend big money, but they also have real issues that make their characters more rounded out, and makes this reality show actually seem real. They don't just fight over a sour comment (although they do that too), they have issues such as divorce, suicide, bankruptcy, and so on that are included on the show. ",2012
1,"This ""scripted melodrama"" encourages women to stay in a perpetual state of self-absorbed, immature, petty unsympathetic, materialistic, and adolescent state of being. I remember the late Arthur Ash suggesting that people need to ""chose their role models well."" A face-lift on a fifty year old ""teenager-hag"" does not a role model make. ",2017
10,"I completely understand why this series scores so low on the IMDb rating: it's trashy, cheap and fake.",2012
10,"Talk about having some real scandalous fun. Tramped emotions everywhere and all those little broken hearts. Now this is interesting stuff. I can't help it, some of these reality TV shows are so silly, you just have to watch them. Kind of like, 'Gilligan's Island' or 'Lost in Space' - you can classify them as irritating fun. Are the shows phony? well, you make your mind up on that one...if you really care. For me - I do not care one bit. Watch anything Hollywood puts out and they label it as a ""True Story"" - do you believe that? Nah. Anyways, if you want to see the fur fly and claws come out - check this show out. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.",2017

10,"I watch almost all of the real housewives shows but this one is my favorite. I have to say though through all of the different cast members never did I dislike someone as much as I dislike Joyce. She has done nothing but start trouble since she started and she repeats and twists everything anyone says to her. Just because someone says a joke about a black person swimming does not make her racist nor does calling someone by the wrong name make them a bully. I think the only bully would be Joyce for calling and branding Brandi with names because she couldn't take a joke knowing how that could affect her children and her life. When my friends joke with me all the time about how white girls can't jump I do not call them racists nor would that even cross my mind. Grow up Joyce, life does not revolve around you as much as you want it to! I'm 100% for a guy standing up for a women but come on do you really need to fight your wife's battles with another women? Love Lisa! And especially love her new show vanderpump rules, makes for a fun Monday night and gives us something to talk about and look forward to until the following week. The real housewives of Beverly Hills is a great watch for all ages and types, highly recommend it. Looking forward to visiting Beverly Hills with my family to go to Sur!",2014
10,"I saw Leap Year today. Matthew Goode has been a favorite of mine since his performance in Chasing Liberty with Mandy Moore. Amy Adams was new to me. Both leads were outstanding in this film. I am 58 and single, an old softy who always looks for a good ""chick flick"" and this one is a beaut. I don't want to give away anything. Just see it. You will love the interplay between Amy and Matthew. Theirs is a very sweet romance that builds ever so slowly. For laughs, there are pratfalls and other silliness (that's a good thing). The supporting characters are also funny and charming. The Irish countryside is gorgeous. On the way out, I heard a man behind me tell his wife ""That was a good movie. I'd see it again."" So would I. Definitely!",2010
9,"I just got back from the theater under an hour ago, and am still in a good mood after having watched this. Some romantic comedies are more comedy than romance, or more romance than comedy, but this one blends the two into something especially delightful. I left the theater with more of a bounce in my step and a wide smile on my face, despite having had a not so great day.",2010
7,"Anna (Amy Adams) - busy, dedicated, talented, goal oriented with one track mind on life matters. Has ""what she wants and not what she needs"".",2010
10,"I absolutely adored this movie. So much so that I watched it 6 times within one week. Not because it's anything amazing or Oscar-worthy. Don't expect anything completely awe- inspiring, complex, or brilliant. It's just a simple love story. And what I really appreciate about this movie is how innocent and lighthearted it is. Kind of a breath of fresh, romantic air. Adams and Goode have amazing chemistry and perform their personalities to a T. It was really fun to watch the steady but stubborn transformation of their relationship throughout the movie. If you're a little bored by the acting in the very beginning, don't give up on it... It gets better! And it's even better the second time around.",2010
8,"The uptight stager Anna Brady (Amy Adams) from Boston is a planner that stages apartments for Realtors. Anna has been dating the cardiologist Jeremy (Adam Scott) for four years and they are buying a high standard apartment in Davenport together. Anna expects Jeremy to propose her in a dinner but he gives a pair of rings to her instead and travels to Dublin for a congress. Anna decides to meet him in Dublin on the February 29th and propose him in accordance with an old Irish folklore tradition from the Fifth Century of leap-year proposals by women. However, her airplane is forced to land in Wales due to bad weather and she is not able to find a connection since the Dublin airport is closed. She decides to travel in a supply vessel but she is forced to disembark in Dingle due to a storm. Anna walks to the only restaurant and inn of the area and she hires the cynical and sarcastic owner Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. Declan accepts to drive her since he needs money to quit his debts and along their journey they have many incidents. But they fall in love for each other but when they finally arrive in Dublin, Jeremy proposes Anna. ",2010
8,"I had a chance to see an advance showing, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. But for me, Amy Adams can do no wrong. She lights up the screen in every scene, whether in a drama such as ""Doubt,"" or a lighter story, as in ""Julie & Julia."" Her character, Anna, is sweet and vulnerable, but self-reliant when she has to be. The male actors support Ms Adams admirably and the pace never lags, thanks to competent direction of Anand Tucker. The Irish countryside is spectacular. The story is a variation on an old theme, but it is retold in movies because it is a good one. This is a fine date movie, but enjoyable as well for those of us who fondly remember the sometimes funny, sometimes painful quest for a mate.",2010
8,"It has been years since my wife and I have seen a new romantic comedy that did not offend or annoy us with some element or another. Even our favorite current director in the genre, Richard Curtis, slips in a bit of unnecessary Chaucerian vulgarity. At his best, it redeems itself, but it seems a fixation (artistic or commercial, I wonder?).",2010
1,"Where do I start?? Oh yes, why do Americans always portray ALL Irish people as backward, smelly, Guinness guzzling, tractor driving, mumbling smelly farmers that wear tweed hats and knitted jumpers. Oh yes... and the mobile phone invention hasn't reached Ireland yet either by all accounts. Public transport is a bit of a disaster too you know! And why would the 'cool Irish guy' EVER go for an annoying, materialistic, American girl? Why does that always happen in these stupid films too? This film is so disgustingly predictable. I do like the occasional 'Rom Com' (I hate that word!) but this is dire, diabolical drivel at it's best! The groaning continued long after the film ended. And the thing that gets me....most people on this website loved it. Dear God...",2010
1,"This is one of the most shockingly bad movies I've ever seen. I love Amy Adams more than the women in my own family and really thought that I could watch her in just about anything-Junebug, Enchanted, Charlie Wilson's War-she really does bring some sparkle into whatever she gets her teeth into. Here however, she can, at best, be described as a flower growing on a dung-heap.",2011
1,"Actually that's my first review because it's the first time I feel so angry after seeing a movie. I thought that I'm going to watch a romantic comedy movie, classic may be but I was shocked by the most disgusting movie ever. The beginning was promising, and that's the all you will get from the movie. The story wasn't well built, shallow, not convincing how the personages changed by the events, how they become in love and the reason why the girl dumbed her fiancé.I didn't feel that experience could change her and that Matthew Goode's words could have that big effect on her. I'm not going to talk about comedy that didn't exist. It's the worst painful experience for me.",2013
5,"OK ...first of all the Cliffs of Moher are not in Dingle so don't plan a trip there expecting to see those amazing cliffs ...they are in Connemara, on Ireland's West coast. Also a ferry from Wales can bring you to Dublin in 2 hours .... to get to Dingle will take you 24 hrs!!! I know it's just a movie but please!! Also could they not find an equally handsome Irish actor to play the Irish fella - British born Mr. Goode's accent was awful and all over the place. He couldn't decide himself what part of Ireland he was supposed to be from. Last but not least nobody in Ireland would ever get married on a Sunday (or plan it outside at the end of Feb) .... total blasphemy. I enjoyed the comedy and the chemistry between the 2 main characters and apart from the very predictable script it was a cute little movie. I suppose I'm just a wee bit offended that the writers couldn't have made the back drop a bit more believable.",2010
10,"Well, I see that many people do not like this movie. It reminds me of my whirlwind and surprise wedding. I love it!",2010
1,"If you see one film which makes you want to take a holiday in Ireland this year, make sure it's not this one.",2010
1,"This film was really, really painfully bad. To give you an idea, I watched it a few months ago and the badness really stuck with me, enough so to specifically join up to IMDb to write my first review on how rubbish it was now. At the time it was scoring a 6 on IMDb so it seemed like there might be some element of enjoyment to be had from it - after all I was really not expecting that much from a rom-com anyway. Little did I know. The plot was ridiculous (and i'm allowing for the fact that rom-com plots are often silly). The characters are detestable and you don't give a hoot what happens to them, though the outcome is obvious the whole way through. Some people have said on here it is not your average rom-com. I would agree - it is far worse.",2011
10,"The latest film directed by Enanda Tucker certainly gives not so much false hope that romance and romantic moments still exist. In this really interesting film, the young actors Amy Adams and Matthew Goode certainly separates us from stress and harsh reality, and even in the hour and a half, give some hope in love. That is, I guess, and the essence of the film - and beautiful illusion, which is all we surrender! Ana is a haughty and self-confident woman (Amy Adams in the interpretation, which we know from the great movie Catch Me If You Can) lives a seemingly perfect life. Doing his job arranger, in connection with the young and successful cardiologist, and after a long connection, expect from your chosen that proposes ... But is it really happy? ",2010
10,"I loved this movie. It was the best romantic comedy I've seen all year, super sweet, with the right amount of sexual tension to keep the audience pegged to the screen without relying on sex to carry the thing through. First comedy I've seen in a long while that didn't somehow contrive to get the characters into bed with one another in order to further the plot along or convince the audience that they did in fact ""love"" each other. Great tale of two people who fall madly in love as one rediscovers her heritage, and one rediscovers his heart. This is the way movies should be made. Watch this movie. Well worth the watching.",2010
1,"This movie was SO lame, it was almost unwatchable. In fact, it was totally unwatchable, but my daughter wanted me to watch the whole thing with her. The things we do for love. The story line was the typical boy/girl meet, hate at first glance, which was preposterous, totally unbelievable. ",2011
2,"Amy Adams is great, but she isn't enough to keep ""Leap Year"" from yielding to an overabundance of clichés and an unfunny script.",2015
1,"This movie has resulted in me missing two hours of my life. The director portrays Ireland( The Republic of Ireland) as a stagnant backwater from a bygone era, and its people unrivaled in unsophistication! The Cliffs of Moher are in the Burren, not Connemara, nor Kerry! You would be more likely to meet a herd of S500's on the Dublin road from Dingle than a herd of cattle(I mean the main road, that was no where near a main road.",2010
10,"I am a guy, so this is hard for me to admit, but I really, really enjoyed this movie. A beautiful travelogue through Ireland with the infectious Amy Adams and the amazing (and underrated) Matthew Goode. Honestly, this is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. It doesn't try to be more than it is, it's just simply a funny and uplifting story, very well told.",2010
2,"This is the reason why so many googley-eyed American girls are in relationships with dead-beats. OF COURSE its a good idea to leave the financially independent, responsible, kind, reliable, CARDIOLOGIST! who promises a future of wealth and security for the rest of your life (and your children) in the apartment/city of your dreams, for a rude, bitter, emotionally unstable chip-on-the-shoulder, glorified bartender who has trouble paying his bills, and saying no less than 5 inappropriate, rude things per hour in a country/life-style you know nothing about! She says that she needs to be in control because her house was repo'd when she was young. But in the end she realizes that plans are for chumps! I hope she enjoys her divorce in 8 months. Way to set another great example of ""real life"" love and marriage, Hollywood. This film was so unrealistic and disappointing that I was unhappy they ended up together in the end. Notice how he didn't change a thing about himself in the end or COME to get HER, but she left HER entire life--everything she had built for herself--to be with this low-life emotional baggage-case! Nuf- said.",2014

1,"This was the worst piece of television I have ever seen. Shane Van Dyke was having a laugh when he made this. The effects were a total joke, looked like a PC game from about 10 years ago. The story was madness (an 800mph tsunami forces an iceberg into the path of the titanic). James Cameron must have been laughing his head off. Acting was awful, can't believe any actors would star in this film even for money. If you have 2 hours of your life you don't want to get back, you should watch this film. Almost so bad it's actually good. I hope they don't consider a titanic 3 because that would really be a disgrace to the film industry.",2010
1,"It's laugh-out-loud BAD. The script, acting, plot are all woeful and my 12yr old could have done a more convincing job with the CGI. Most of it is filmed on the real Queen Mary which is now a hotel in Long Beach, Ca or in a concrete bunker, sorry, ""engine room"". They hired about 20 extras from the local homeless shelter by the look of them who wander around aimlessly or fall over their own feet during ""action"" sequences. There is some preachy stuff about global warming backed up by bogus ""science"" and a 800mph tsunami (that's faster than the speed of sound folks!). I hope this movie was released as a joke but fear it wasn't. But seriously, if you haven't seen it yet then please do so because it's hilarious and you'll have lots of fun spotting the glaring errors, continuity bloopers, wooden acting and super-low budget production. It's so bad it's good.",2010

I can't imagine paying to buy this DVD, this is the most awful movie I have ever seen. The acting was high school thespian at best, they all appeared to be students of some second rate acting school. I would not recommend this video to anyone. Out of respect to the original Titanic and the poor souls who went down with her, it is a shame that such a poorly done movie about a new Titanic was done so cheaply and with such low budget actors. This is a waste of film and money.",2010

It was so painful I do not believe I could begin to adequately describe the trauma I now feel - I genuinely write this as a warning to my fellow human beings who value their sanity. Never in my life have I seen work (of any form) of such poor quality. Having only just finished viewing this film I feel the need for a shower and referral to a good psychiatrist. I've been more entertained watching paint dry - and a tin of paint could produce/direct a better cinematic experience. Simple put, if 0 out of 10 was I option I'd have awarded that instead - I want my 1.5 hours back!! THE HORROR, THE HORROR!!",2010

1,"Be warned that this is probably the worst movie ever made. At least it gave a good actor, Bruce Davison, employment. Nice concept, but so poorly made that you understand immediately that the makers knew zero about the 1912 Titanic and cared even less. With an obvious low budget, the movie made use of the 1930's Queen Mary permanently moored at Long Beach, CA. But, 1912 maritime design is very different from 1930s maritime design as was White Star Line, (Titanic), to Cunard Line, (Queen Mary). Shots included the sea wall enclosing the Queen Mary, rust on the railings of this ""brand new Titanic II"", and red funnels when the original Titanic had yellow funnels, (which they corrected within the movie and then went back to red funnels). Some scenes showed the ship with three funnels, some scenes she had four funnels. One of the best, laughable scenes was the cast running down into the ""engine room"" with concrete walls!!!? The Titanic II sailed with the name emblazoned on it's bow, then the name was gone, then it was back again? Where were the continuity people? Or could they not afford to employ them. The score even had slight reminisces of the movie Titanic's score in a shameful attempt to piggy-back on the success of the James Cameron movie. Gives new meaning to unoriginal and predictable. Do yourself a favor. Skip this movie. It's not even good trash.",2010
1,"Really I can't Vote 0? Titanic 2 was an absolutely horrible waste of time. Awful acting and outdated FX, I've seen better from high school students. The story was highly unbelievable, however may have been more entertaining if better presented. The only thing that drew me to the movie and kept me watching was how bad it is. Its like when some1 says ""careful its hot"" you gotta touch it just to see how hot it is, I just had to watch to believe. I fully agree that Titanic 3 should never happen. Although, nor should have Titanic 2 which has left me in shock that this movie was ever made, and empathic of all involved with Cameron's Titanic for having their amazing work now associated with this.",2010

But inside, it is completely different, including turbo powered engines that can run at speeds up to 50 knots. Meanwhile, scientist Dr Kim Patterson (Brooke Burns) studying the effects of global warming on the Greenland ice sheet discovers a crack in the ice. Just as she is explaining this to top scientist James Maine (a sleepwalking Bruce Davison), the ice breaks. The tidal wave is enormous and moving at 850 miles per hour. It sweeps icebergs in its path. A Navy submarine is destroyed. The Titanic II tries to outrun it, but the engines overheat and it is stranded. An iceberg smashes into the side and it starts to sink.

10,"This film brought tears of uncompromising elation to my eyes. It was undoubtedly one of the most illuminating movie viewing experiences of my life. James Cameron's adaptation of the tragic story ended too soon, and was far too hindered by factual ethics. An 800mph tsunami in the north Atlantic and explosions are far more visually gratifying than a cliché collision with an ice burg. Coupled with a wholehearted call for awareness for environmental issues for the icecaps of Greenland and a graphic and scientifically based depiction of the very likely outcome of our continued environmental apathy and negligence. This film touched me on a spiritual level. Titanic II is similar to the story of Christ, expressing the true selfless nature of man. This film has changed all of my expectations for future films, this movie may have bested the birthing of Jesus and will give the second coming of Christ a run for its money. Jesus had better hire Michel Bay for special effects if he wishes to best this masterpiece.",2012

It's just a smart move from the studios to name their picture ""Titanic II"" and I'm sure that the title alone has already earned them lots of money. The title refers to the name of a new modern luxury liner, that got build in the honor of the 100th anniversary of the original voyage, of the original Titanic, who's faith we all know.

The story line is rubbish the actors are rubbish nothing even looks or feels remotely real. The film could have been shot by a 5 year old! Don't waste your time with this it will ruin titanic the original for you. Graphics of the film look like something from ship simulator (most probably). All i can see from the story is they make a new titanic II in memory of the first and oh what a surprise it sinks AGAIN. The story is purely all about how the coast guards daughter is aboard the ship and he goes to save her. The story is predictable within the first 20 minutes oh and the ships control room looks like someone's conservatory with the blinds shut! The controls for the ship looks like well so fake everything is fake and at one point in the film you see the chief engineer run past a long window which is just a lit up city outside!!!",2011

1,"What can I say, other then felt compelled to add my tuppence worth. Some films are so bad they are funny. This is not one or those films. This is worse. In fact its so bad it will never make it on to a worse 100 list because that would mean it would have to get a rating of some sort.",2011

4,"I wanted to like this film, the only problem is it has very large shoes to fill. The two films that come to mind, obviously, are ""Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight"" with Billy Zane (rated a 6.6/10 here) which tackled the whole ""end of the world/standoff in diner/lone hero fighting alongside the little guys against a legion of bad guys"" thing 10 times better and ""The Prophecy"" with Christopher Walken (also rated a 6.6/10 here) which tackled the whole ""good angel versus bad angel/showdown on earth"" thing 10 times better. Both came out in 1995 and while they didn't have the special effects that this one had, they had a cohesive story, GREAT acting and believable characters.",2010
9,"Legion is actually a pretty good movie. I had low expectations when I got this film on DVD. The trailers also looked somewhat lame. I only saw this because two of my best friends recommended it to me. Well, I'm glad they did. I actually thought this was going to be a straight up horror movie but it isn't. I'm not a big fan of horror movies. This is more like a action/fantasy movie.",2010
3,"The overall premise of the film is a little silly yes, but it's incredibly original and it had so much potential.",2010

7,I'm not sure what most of these people writing bad reviews wanted out of this film......,2010
3,"Judging from the trailer this movie was supposed to be a whole lot of action while the talking takes a backseat, unfortunately the 30 second trailer contained all the action you are going to see over 100 minutes of the full movie.",2010
7,"This is going to be a tough review to write. The reason I say that is because Legion for all intents and purposes is not a good film. Its ridiculous, preposterous, with plot holes the size of cannon balls. You could pick this film apart until there was nothing left of it but angel wings and dirt. So here is the thing. Legion was incredibly entertaining! The action was wicked and intense, the characters were fun and intriguing, it was gory and action packed so despite everything else I had fun. You basically have to let go of everything to go into this film. And some people can do that because a movie is not always art, or full of message and morality, a film can also just be absolutely nothing but entertain and for me Legion did exactly that. Upon retrospect of the film you'll start to realize the startling amount of errors and plot holes but I think a movie should be reviewed mostly on its first impression like when you're sitting in the theater. The unfortunate side to the film is that it misses the incredible potential of this epic good vs evil battle by making the story rather convoluted and underusing the characters of Michael and Gabriel.",2010
3,"Sadly, Legion is a movie that one WANTS to enjoy... Unfortunately, there really is just nothing really ""good"" about this movie. The film doesn't particularly appeal to ANY group of movie-goers. The plot and character development wear very thin, so anyone watching the movie for a good story will be disappointed. Low-attention-spanned action-buffs will find dull, repetitive fights and action sequences. People looking for good, well-portrayed actors will find shoddy performances from almost every player in the movie.",2010

6,"The trailer had me thinking that this would be one heck of a slice and dice fest in the same vein as Feast or even The Mist, with a group of rag tag survivors being huddled together in a diner / supermarket, and the fight for survival against invading monsters of all shapes, sizes and surprises. The latter film also had a bible-thumper, and religion forms the basis of the premise here, when you see how it all becomes a modern day re-imagining of the tale of Mary, Joseph, and the prophetic messiah baby.",2010
6,"I saw the film last night. It started out like a typical ""Survival Horror"" film. A group of different people. A mysterious stranger rolls into town. All Hell (excuse me...HEAVEN) breaks loose. Then just as soon as the film got going, someone stabbed a pitchfork in it and turned it over. It totally changed gears.",2010
6,"JESTERS REVIEW: -will contain spoilers- From the start of the film i knew i was in for a ride, whether i enjoyed it was really up to my state of mind at the time... the film opens very much like ""the terminator"" will the angel Michael feeling a lot like kyle Reese, but it doesn't stop there. Paul Bettany was very enjoyable as the fallen angel who goes against god. For me this was a film with a lot of missed opportunities... the ice cream man who turned into the human spider.. here was a moment that was drawn out and you were expecting a big attack and it ends so abruptly with NOTHING happening. When all the cars start driving towards the diner why they stop and get out is beyond me... why they don't just run all 300 cars into the diner killing everyone is something i wont understand... there is no real explanation for a lot like why Gabriel didn't just show up right away, or why the director cast Lucas black(God truly punished me by showing black try to act). Overall it was a fun movie but flawed. I did enjoy it but felt that i kept asking why is this happening A lot. And as the main characters drive away to end the film we see ""our Sarah Connor"" (even wearing a bandanna) and she says god is tired of the bulls**t and i have to agree i was tired of asking why and trying to figure out the bulls**t. in the end it needed to be simpler with more action... to much was left to the imagination. have faith... have faith they will corrected the wrongs with the straight to DVD sequel.",2010
7,"It often pains me, after seeing a film I consider perfectly watchable, to come to IMDb and find the majority of reviews ripping it apart. Though this is by no means a masterpiece it is an enjoyable, well structured film with good acting, good scripting and a solid plot. I've seen lots of people complaining that the last quarter is a weak point and though I can see the argument it still does run everything back together nicely. There are some weird points not fully explained (SPOILER: the prophetic tattoos on Jeeps arm?) and I do find the level of character death-rate slightly too high. Yet I finished the film feeling it had made its point: humanity is basically scum but with redeeming features, nothing too high brow or original but valid none the less. I didn't find the acting or lines overly cheesy or strained as others have said; in fact I thought Paul Bettany did a damn fine job being the soldier built on compassion his character required. Perhaps he could have been slightly less mystical about his intentions but then again I wouldn't have thought many people would accept ""I'm an angel disobeying God by protecting this potential prophet"". Overall, what I really wish to stress with this review is that the current 5/10 rating is fine until held in comparison. IMDb currently rates films which ARE poorly scripted, cheesily acted and generally confusing with plot lines such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Lost Boys at much higher status (6-7/10) and I don't feel that, in comparison, Legion deserves its current status. It is very similar to many big Hollywood films such as Wolverine: it's an enjoyable, well acted romp with some decent if not too subtle character development and a script which does the job.",2011
8,"Despite the trailers and how ""Legion"" was marketed, this is a very intelligent, well-crafted, and subtle story. To be quite blunt, this is a ""message"" movie that unfolds in a way that is a bit more discrete than what most viewers will be expecting.",2010
5,"Legion is about the apocalypse and one fallen angel who tries to save the last hope for humanity. With such a high concept, it's weird how it's actually taking place in a rather constrained space : a truck diner lost in an American desert. My first impression was that the special effects looked cheap (witness the first human transformation and the way ""it"" talks while barely moving its mouth). It's an impression that stayed with me throughout until perhaps the final antagonist. My second impression was that the acting wasn't that bad. I didn't recognize the actor playing the main angel character (Paul Bettany) until the day after while reading the credits. He's not one we usually see as an action hero in this kind of flick but he gave a decent performance as the strong stoic type. I also remembered Lucas Black (playing Jeep : what a lousy character's name) from the time he was a talented child actor. He still is. We also have the ever reliable Dennis Quaid in a supernatural thriller yet again. ",2010
2,"If Feast, and Splinter have shown us anything, is that sometimes the claustrophobic feeling of a close quarters set can almost be an extra character in the film. Legion went for this, but failed. After seeing the trailers, I was hoping Legion would kickstart 2010's horror'ish lineup into full gear. I couldn't have been more wrong.",2010
1,"It was awful. It was a complete waste of money. The best part of the whole movie was when Dennis Quaid died. Almost everyone in the theater clapped when he did. The effects were equivalent to Pacman arcade games that I used to play back in the 90's. I felt like the whole movie was just a cheap imitation of Constantine with Keanu Reeves. I couldn't figure out if certain parts of the movie were supposed to be funny or if the acting was just so cheesy that they were. I like how the previews made the movie look way more awesome than it really was. I highly recommend everyone to not see it, or Day Breakers either for that matter.",2010
6,"The plot doesn't make much sense and the ending certainly isn't stitched together very well, but I don't know of one of the ""Warring Angels"" films that's ever accomplished either of those objectives.",2013

In the meantime in an god-forsaken diner in the middle of New Mexico several lost travellers and the diner's employees surprisingly become a central point to the apocalypse. All because of the unborn baby of the diner's hapless waitress. Soon people possessed by angels appear and only Michael's arrival helps stave off the impending doom...",2010
8,"First off, Jude Law and Paul Bettany must share a personal trainer because Mr Bettany is as ripped in this as Jude is in Repomen. Omigod! Those abs, those arms! ",2010
8,"This movie didn't arrive in my country with much fanfare, so before I bought a ticket I did some research. Most reviews were negative, but I went to see it out of pure boredom. I didn't expect much and having read all the negative reviews I watched it with my critics glasses on.",2010
1,"Ugh. Why do almost all the movies about angels that I see have to be so boring, pretentious and poorly made? First, there was ""Constantine"" and now, there is ""Legion"", another pathetic and unoriginal attempt to create a ""cool"" supernatural themed movie using religious motifs. ",2012
1,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, as is what many people do when they spontaneously go to the movies, and honestly i had an open mind about the movie from beginning to end. From an acting standpoint, Paul Bettany and Dennis Quaid did quite a fine job covering up Lucas Black's terrible acting and dreadful fake dialect, and were quite fine on their own, as they often are in their other movies, but the rest of the cast, with the exception of Charles S Dutton couldn't act their way out of a paper sack. Second, the only consistent thing thing throughout the movie was (*spoiler*) the baby- the fact that it was going to be... important. The baby's importance is never defined. Why Matthew dies and then somehow returns (And then disappears immediately following) is never explained. The characters are introduced, elaborated on slightly, and then killed, leaving the viewer puzzled as to their importance in the plot. Not EVEN to mention the fact that a newborn baby was not buckled in a seatbelt, then gets in a major car crash, and survives the crash with no injuries whatsoever. Overall, the plot was inconsistent, the acting was mediocre, i was not absorbed into the movie, and the whole experience was a waste of my time and money. i plan on calling and asking for my money back. I recommend that nobody sees this movie at all.",2010
1,"Words can not express just how DIRE, this film really is. It is a confused screenplay, messy plot, and very average special effects.",2010
7,"Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.",2010
10,"I enjoyed this flick - it's a satisfying thriller with nonstop action, and Jolie does it proud. I would like to say that I'm surprised by all the negative reviews, all of which seem to take offense at the various ""illogical"" and ""unrealistic"" aspects of the film. These same folks no doubt LOVE films like Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean, films of the fairy tale genre with license to dismiss realism altogether. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But it is too bad they can't appreciate a fine little thriller like this that just fudges with reality a bit. Almost every James Bond film was at least as silly as this film, but I loved all them too, as did most of the world. Maybe these picky folks are just a bunch of chauvinistic men and jealous women. I say let them eat cake.",2011
6,While I was expecting a little more sophistication in the plot department I realized that such a thing couldn't happen when US versus Russia is at play. (To my knowledge the Cold War is over and the spy business has become more complicated than ever. This oversimplification of old enemies and their wars is too much.) The plot is all over the place and realism is thrown out of the door. There are too many things happening in the movie that are too convenient and even impossible. Still it didn't keep me from enjoying this movie. It even managed to thrill me at occasions even if I was aware that most of the plot was nonsense. Jolie does an excellent job as the action heroine. The action is that makes this movie tick and that is almost the only thing that should count in a movie like this.Ignore the bashing and trashing of Jolie. This is pure entertainment!,2010
5,"It almost seems as if it were scheduled to make up for the headiness of Chris Nolan's Inception (yeah, I know, it wasn't THAT smart, but compared to the vast majority of American blockbusters...). It's pretty much a Bourne rip-off. It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who is exposed as a Russian sleeper agent by a Russian defector. Whether she is one or not, her bosses (Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber) decide to keep her under wraps. She'll have none of that, though, as she fears for the safety of her spider expert husband. So basically, like Bourne, it's about a defecting agent running from her employers while simultaneously trying to foil the bad guys. The film does have a couple of semi-clever twists, but it also contains a metric ton of stupidity. There's no real set-up for Jolie being some kind of Bourne-like superwoman, yet as soon as the action sequences start she's either MacGuiver or Jackie Chan. Weighing in at about 95 pounds (seriously, Angie, eat a burger) she's able to beat the everloving crap out of every trained CIA, FBI or Secret Service agent who gets in her way. The filmmaking is reminiscent of Bourne, but, unlike Bourne, the choreography is confusing and implausible. Very little of the plot makes any sense, from the reason for the initial exposure to Jolie's motivations to the final sequence. Any moderate examination reveals the film to make no sense whatsoever.",2010
6,"When Bruce Willis makes crash landings in the original ""Die Hard"" movie, at least he winces in pain and it takes him a few moments to regain composure. In ""Salt"", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.",2010
7,"Was it realistic? No. Did all the dots get connected? Not all. Was it fun to watch? Yes. Was it predictable? Not entirely. Lots of twists & turns. If you don't mind people sliding down a banister with six-shooters out shooting 5 hit men with Uzi's, then you'll probably like it. (This didn't really happen, and I don't really know guns but you get the message.) I thought I had it all figured out but I was oh so wrong. I would like to see it again, knowing what I know now. There wasn't a lot of cursing and relatively little blood & guts considering this type of movie. I must say, sitting next to some women who liked shouting at the screen and throwing their own punches heightened the excitement for the audience.",2010
4,I wonder is there any more stupid image of Russia in the history of American movies? Where did you get these surnames? Ask any Russian on the net for a huge bunch of real Russian surnames. Where did you get this ring kissing ritual? Stupid.,2010
2,"Seriously you guys? At one point of the film the Russians kill a guy and celebrate that in the following way: everybody just pulls out a shot of vodka. They are all carrying guns, machine guns etc. and in the next moment they just pull out glasses FILLED with vodka! WTF?! Seriously? The whole movie is kinda ridiculous - special agent ""Salt"" does not kill a single American (just injures a few, but never fatally), however when she's got the chance she murders at least a dozen Russians without a blink of her eye. And we are supposed to be wondering if she's a Russian or American spy. REEEAAAALLY? This movie is just awful. ",2010
3,"I went into this thinking Angelina Jolie looks hot and it will be exciting. Instead it's an overblown mess with jerky camera angles and a plot so convoluted that you could drive a car through the plot holes. Ms Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian sleeper cell spy as well. So she runs and runs and runs and sports a black wig and expensive sunglasses like a character from the Matrix. And they do what I always hate in movies , they zoom in during the fight scenes which makes it all blurry and jerky ,what's the point.By the end of the movie I was so put out especially with the shameless setup for a sequel, Jolie running off into the woods,fade to black.I left the movie theater thinking I'll bet critics like that windbag Ebert will like this movie yet trash another movie that is way better. ",2010
1,"I thought that this film would be an exciting mix of action, thriller, espionage and drama. Instead it's an overblown farce and a plot resembling blancmange. Angelina Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian spy as well. So she gets exposed and runs away (but somehow doesn't look anything the action figure of Lara Croft but quite ungainly and pathetic) and uses a black wig and sunglasses like a Matrix character which doesn't hide her at all. In fact, at one point when trying to allude the CIA she disguises herself in a Russian fur hat and fur coat. Hilarious! In another scene she randomly picks some dry cleaning off a rail in a hotel and surprise surprise the suit fits like it's tailored. Her disguise to go into the White House is just so ridiculous that you actually feel shame for the director and make up artist. Interestingly throughout the film special agent ""Salt"" does not kill a single American, however she kills every Russian she can. And we are supposed to be wondering if she's a Russian spy? This film is so bad and panders so shamefully to the uneducated ill informed American conception of an evil enemy that really the only thing missing is the idea of an Arab funding it all from a cave in Afghanistan.",2010
1,"The movie is utterly outrageous. Nothing in it is barely logical. From start to finish what you see is Angelina Jolie as an indestructible war machine with no plausible or understandable aim. A really bad movie... unless you care only about fighting scenes and impossible action. Like don't getting a bruise jumping from car to car, climbing barehanded the wall of a fifteen storeys building, jumping in a winter lake from a helicopter, or swooping down an elevator shaft. One of the worst movies ever. The people dubbing in Russian are even not that bad, but the overall impression is quite sad. BTW, have you seen the handcuffs? With a half-meter chain between them, you can really hurt somebody... Did you notice that she has a blood stain on her back when she got shot, even if she is wearing a bullet-proof jacket?",2010
1,"Awful movie. The plot is ridiculous! US CIA, FBI, White House etc, filled with Russian spies, A. Jolie is indestructible! She escapes from every place and break into the White House bunker for god sake! As a comedy i would have rated it above 3 but as an action/thriller movie...it's a 1!!! Some might like unrealistic movie looking for a little bit of fun...but i don't even think it even did that for me. There is nothing new in this movie, nothing that you don't have in Jason Bourne (a million times better) so why would you watch this horrible one. A superwoman who can make bazooka from a chair, bleach and extinguisher better than Mcguiver and kicking everybody's behind better than Jacky Chan although she's probably 50kg with not a single muscle...please! And at the end, while she is supposed to be the biggest terrorist on earth the guy let her go because she told him she's innocent!! To be honest i don't know how i got to the end of that movie if we can call it a movie!",2010

1,"Typical Hollywood action trash with no story, no logic, little acting. It's so bad it's hard where to start. The plot is laughably outrageous. It seems that movie makers believe if they don't outdo competition and themselves in the ridiculousness department, it won't sell. Maybe they do have a point, as the American audience seems to have addiction problems, and they seek ever increasing doses of unbelievability when it comes to plot and action sequences. This year's movies gotta have louder explosions, more car chases, even more impossible stunts, and bigger conspiracy theories than last year's.",2010

There is a little bit for everybody. The build up in the movie was great as well, from begging to end this movie never lets go of that tension it has built up. What also really helped this movie was the lack of plot holes. With a blockbuster hit like SALT, the director normally has no problems leaving big plot holes in the script, but this film doesn't do that. This movie was thought out immaculately. Last but not least, lets also give a shout out to Angelina Jolie (SALT) for giving her best performance in years. Any movie critic can give her credit for her Oscar winning performance.",2017

6,"I remember watching the original 1978 ""I Spit on Your Grave"" earlier this year and thinking that it packed one hell of a visceral punch while also carrying quite an angry proto-feminist slant. Yeah, it was obviously a low-budget exploitation horror picture with a strong feminist subtext, but it was both shocking and challenging on a deep emotional level - challenging everything you thought you knew about humanity, justice, violence, and revenge & retribution.",2012

It's not giving anything away to reveal that there's a rape scene in this film but be warned it puts anything you saw in ""Last House on the Left"" the remake to shame.

8,"Back in 1978, the film I Spit on Your Grave (also known as Day of the Woman) provoked controversy due to its violence, gore and for daring to show a woman taking revenge on her own hands against the louts who raped her. As the time went by, the film became into a cult classic, not so much due to its intrinsic merits, but for having been censored (or forbidden) in many countries, something which helped to make it more popular. Personally, I respect its influence on horror cinema, but into the sub-genus of ""female revenge"", I prefer movies like Thriller: A Cruel Picture and Ms. 45, because I found them to be better written, acted and directed.",2011

1,"The ONLY positive thing that can be said about the remake of I Spit on Your Grave is that it has made me realize how good the original is. I never liked Meir Zarchi's rape-revenge shocker, but I now can appreciate it for the gritty, basic thriller that it is. Remakes are almost always pointless, but in horror cinema, remakes are an opportunity new filmmakers to polish, upgrade and outdo the original. In attempting this, director Steven Monroe has more or less made a movie which lives up to the unfair negative press the original received. In other words, it is a movie which is misogynistic, exploitative and far sleazier than the the original.",2011
7,"Remakes are a dime a dozen these days but when you go through your old DVD or video collection and you come across the 1978 original I Spit On Your Grave you cant help but think ""not a chance they will remake this"". But remake it they have and the storyline is a mirror image of the original but for some reason this new version doesn't seem to be as nasty as the original. The reasons for this might have to do with the fact that the actors can actually act, its shot in a cleaner, more professional manner and maybe most importantly of all : we are just not that shocked by anything anymore. With more and more films pushing the boundaries of violence and gore, this just doesn't offend as much as the original did in its day. Having said that its still a tough watch and anybody not familiar with the original and not a fan of this genre will find its extended torture and intimidation scenes very difficult to stomach, but with a title like I Spit On Your Grave this movie will only attract a certain type of viewer.",2011

1,"This was a total waste of two hours. The story was terrible, it falls into the torture porn category. There were too many plot holes in this movie, she's a 100 pound weak girl but somehow she moved all the men by herself in several scenes, set up a bear trap and the timing in this movie was just beyond ridiculous. The torture scenes were also so unbelievable, the contraptions she comes up with are pretty elaborate for a city girl who couldn't get the water running at the beginning of the movie. And somehow throughout it all she manages to have several outfit changes and not get a spot of blood on herself. This movie was trash I can't believe millions of dollars were spent on this terrible story. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS.",2011
4,"This movie is different from the original in a way, mostly because the girl that get victimized doesn't seem as graphic as the original cause it skips the scenes where she gets hunted down and constantly raped. Although the parts where the girl gets humiliated drags on and on. And the revenge scenes are more creative and brutal than the original. The redneck villains are more disgusting in this and yet the original somehow got me to hate the villains even more and root for the girl when she does her revenge thing. Besides the revenge being a bit more creative, nothing is all that different from the original. The culprits in both is evil and deserve what they have coming for the most part, but it still wasn't a satisfying movie and overall a pointless remake. Besides the upgraded brutality, there isn't anything that is worth watching in this.",2011
1,"That's pretty much what you learn after seen this movie. How the writer wants us to believe that a girl, raped, beaten almost to dead and fed with rats for weeks suddenly can drag, lift and stages adult men. Also she can breathes under water and be as stealth as a ninja.",2011
9,"I must admit, I haven't seen the original version of this film. I went into the Fantasia festival screening of this Meir Zarchi produced remake fresh, with no personal comparisons to make to his landmark picture (both he and new director Steven R. Monroe were in attendance, along with lead actress Sarah Butler and producer Lisa Hansen). And not knowing many more specifics than the 30 year+ legends of this story. I can say I was impressed with what new writer Stuart Morse and the fine cast have presented and how the talented director interpreted it! Be warned, those who don't like gore or explicit depictions of heinous events. This is probably not the flick you should check out! But if you're strong stomached enough to handle recent ""torture porn"" that has little or no conscience in it's artistry (which this will be dismissed as by many, but I think it's really NOT), then you might dare to watch.",2010
2,"I watched this expecting a horror movie, and I had not heard of the original. I kept hoping the gratuitous rape scene would end but it just kept dragging on and on and it really seems like the only reason this film was made. There is only minimal satisfaction in the revenge scenes but they take a back seat compared to the rape worship. Also some ridiculous plot holes. Why would she go back to the cabin instead of heading to the police station to file a report? Why does this sheriff who is a father not seem to care that he is committing such an act (he has a daughter)?",2014

1,"I love scary movies and a friend of mine told me to watch this movie. I wanted to turn it off after the first 30 minutes. This movie is pretty much a porno. What person wants to watch a poor girl get raped? I certainly do not. I suggest you don't watch this movie it is not worth your time! The only enjoyable part of this movie was when the credits started rolling. I spit on your grave, in my opinion, is probably the worst ""scary"" movie i have ever seen in my life. There is good reason why this movie got such bad reviews. How this movie got a 6 star rating is beyond me. But if you like rape and like seeing men take advantage of women then this movie would be perfect for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2012
9,"All I can say is... Big Wow. Boy did I enjoy this film. The story-line is a cross between The Fugitive and a human heist plot movie. There were moments where I genuinely really didn't know which way the story would end. Has to be one of the best, if not the best film I've seen this year.",2010
9,"Russell Crowe is a pretty reliable star, one who commands the screen with intelligence and enough bravado to get away with a film like this. Somehow, audiences and critics are getting more demanding and expect brainier and tighter story lines, but it's still plenty of fun to see a light, crazy ride like this... One where the hero is besieged by unfortunate circumstances and must one way or another succeed or die. With the help of Haggis' strong direction and a very good performance by Crow, we're treated to two hours of action, where one doesn't have to do a lot of thinking, just watching Crowe dodge bullet after bullet and cheer him along to the nail-biting end.",2010

8,"This is a surprisingly good movie, not the usual Hollywood formula potboiler. The movie has an interesting story, strong acting and excellent cinematography. Perhaps the plot is somewhat far-fetched but so what? It's a movie. The best part of this movie are not the stars but the supporting cast. Most impressive was the performance by Lennie James who definitely deserves formal recognition for his work in this movie. So strong is his performance that I this movie could easily be retitled ""The Pursuit"" without misleading the audience. Both Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks give strong performances and Brian Dennehy once again proves how great he is as an actor. At times the story does stretch the boundaries of plausibility but never to the point that the story is rendered ridiculous. In this movie there are no bad guys. Rather it dramatizes a justice system that at times may not get it right and how frustration and indignation can lead one to commit acts of desperation.",2010

A movie is, well, a movie. So now that all that is out of the way, where do I even start? This film brought me to tears, it had my attention the whole way through. I don't understand those that say parts are slow, what were they watching? It wasn't this one, that's for sure. Everybody that worked to put this one together did a fantastic job, and it most definitely shows. I do believe the movie touched me so intensely in part because I have a wife and a son, and was able to feel a relation to the characters. Regardless, the movie was just fantastic, and you will not regret the experience. Unless of course you are one of the rising population of ""movie critics"" that score films based on guidelines, or however they get their ridiculous views. Enjoy this one!",2011
10,"This has to be one of the best films I have watched of late. Everything you would wish it to be. Very tense at times and keeps you on edge. Great acting from Russell Crowe and the story is very smart and gripping. Not as predictable as some films seem to be when using a similar storyline to this. Very entertaining all the way through from start to finish with no gaps which is always good for a film that exceeds 2 hours in duration. A very different performance from Crowe which we don't offer see, but be played it very well, and very powerful. Definitely a must watch. Don't wait around for this one, I would strive to watch it straight away for those that haven't done so yet.",2011
8,"In Paul Haggis' new thriller, The Next Three Days, Laura Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is accused of killing her boss and is sent to prison. Her husband, John Brennan (Russell Crowe) battles through the legal system for nearly three years before seemingly running out of options. Choosing not to go the Hilary Swank route a la Conviction and spend the next 30 years trying to learn and eventually beat the system, John elects instead to speak to an expert on prison escapes (a wonderfully placed cameo by Liam Neeson) to get pointers on what to expect in a daring prison break attempt. The Neeson character gives important advice in reference to the time it takes for authorities to seal off a city's exits, but also gives insight into what his plan should include – ""You have to have the entire plan already in place. And you have to ask yourself, can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas stationcause to do this thing, that's what you have to become."" Audiences are then treated to a taut and thrilling attempt by John to free his wife out of prison and reunite the family which includes their young son Luke (Ty Simpkins).",2010

8,"""The Next Three Days"" is a tight, hard-hitting thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. I really didn't know, right up to the final moments, how it would end – and because the film had expertly guided me to care about all the characters, even some random losers in a meth lab, I did care about how it would end. The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so, and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' too-good-to-be-true wholesome, sunny good looks are well used. ""The Next Three Days"" reminded me of Hitchcock, and of 1993's ""The Fugitive,"" but it doesn't rise to that level of classic. Rather, it's a well-oiled machine, designed efficiently to crank out the audience's engagement, tension and release.",2010
5,"First off, this movie is not bad. Not all all. The problem is, however, that I despise this kind of movie making. I can understand the scenario where you see an movie or read a book which has already been made a movie, and think - I can do this better. Or I see a different angle. Or whatever creative idea it might be. This movie though, is not that. This movie is made by accountants. It's a carbon copy of the movie ""Pour Elle"", only in English. Basically it's the most expensive subtitles in the world.",2011
8,"In The Next Three Days, we get to see Russell Crowe in a film that actually takes place in today's world. It's a departure from his better known films that take place in the past such as Gladiator, Master and Commander, and Robin Hood. Even his other films have usually taken place over 50 years ago like Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind. So it's nice to finally see him play a person of modern times that we can relate to – and he excels at it.",2010
7,Another noir French thriller is converted into a 'noir-ish' American thriller. Russell Crowe's slightly thuggish looks make him more convincing as the desperado of the second half than the mild-mannered schoolteacher of the first half. Elizabeth Banks's role as the imprisoned wife is slightly under-written; their cute toddler son steals most of her scenes and even some of Russell's.,2011

But their life radically changes one morning, when the police comes to arrest Lisa on murder charges. She's sentenced to 20 years of prison. Convinced of his wife's innocence, Julien decides to act. How far will he be willing to go for her?"" It is pretty obvious now that The Next Three Days is not the original movie now, both are similar in their plot however being filmed different directing style. Remember the parts of drawings/pinned ups on the wall, the playground and the escape route using the hospital as the key, all these can be found in both movies.",2011
9,"Screenwriters are told that actors choose scripts by reading the first and last ten pages. If the role is any good, the character you meet in the first act evolves into someone else by the end of the film. Russell Crowe's character, John, takes that kind of journey. ",2010

6,"Russel crowe is one of the most recognisable names in Hollywood so I'm interested in anything he is in and I thought this was an alright film. The premise sees a school teacher try and break his wife out of prison and reunite his family. Now this movie only works because of the fantastic performance from russel crowe. He is a truly damaged character who just wants to have his family and his old life back and he will do anything to get it. You root for him but at the same time realise that maybe he is going to far. Elizabeth banks was good as his wife and there was allot of intrigue about the character and their chemistry worked for me. The kid was also pretty good in this movie. There are quite a few characters in this movie that are pointless and unnecessary such as the cops, crowes parents and Olivia Wilde's character that dragged down the film. I like the premise of the story, it is really interesting and I also really like the character development that crowe has. But like I said before there are just too many pointless filler plot threads in this movie and also I think the ending could have been done in a better way. The script wasn't that interesting at all with the dialogue being the main weakness of the film and also some things that characters do comes across as illogical. The style was really cool, I loved the suspense in the film and the action scenes that happened were really cool too. Overall this is a decent movie but I don't really care to see it again.",2015
1,"This is a Hollywood remake of French movie ""Pour elle"" with Diane Kruger. From what I've heard the French thriller is great . This one is an almost carbon copy and it sucks . It's not strange , since it was written and directed by Paul Haggis – famous for the dreadful ""Crash"".",2013

Michael Apted takes the helm of direction and brings this adventure to us in 3D; the first for Narnia.",2010
2,"The first several minutes of the Film, I thought that would be a wonderful addition to the Movie Versions of Narnia. It had a good opening scene and a smooth transition from Prince Caspian to The Dawn Treader. Three scenes later, I was wondering if I had perhaps stepped into the wrong cinema, and if not, when the Chronicles of Narnia turned into a crossover with Deathly Hallows, (Find the seven horcrux - I mean, swords) and what the director and screenwriters were smoking when they filmed this. I spent most of the film staring in horror as the book I loved since childhood was utterly mutilated in the worst book-to-movie adaption since 'Ella Enchanted'. Honestly, the Lone Islands did have a problem with slavery, but there were no human sacrifices, and Lord Bern was a well-off man living happily, if against slave-traders, not some half-mad loon sitting in a dungeon. The Quest was to find the Seven Banished Lords, not to hunt down seven swords, and while I can understand Jadis still lurking among Edmund's fears, the sea serpent was entirely un-necessary. They found Lord Rhoop on the Island of Dreams (BEFORE Ramandu's Island), but he was desperate to get out, not waving his sword around and attacking people. And what orifice did they pull the Evil Mist (TM) out of, anyway? I understood that while Gold/Deathwater Island and Dragon Island were two different places, placing them together was necessary, and carried well, given that both islands brought similar lessons, and the encounter with the Dufflepudds and the Magicitan were pulled off nicely. I found myself praising the Emperor Over The Sea that they got Ramandu's Island and the End of The World/Aslan's Country right. By that point, I was starting to wonder if Miraz was going to come back from the dead and prove to be the 'Great Evil', considering the path the movie was taking. On the positive side, I enjoyed the way that Lucy's insecurity and jealousy of Susan was portrayed, as well as her discovery that she needed to be herself. I also liked the bond between Caspian and the children from our world, and the settings were beautiful.",2010

1,"As a reader who grew up on this series - read through it so many times, in fact, that I have had to buy several sets as I wore them out - and as a very happy supporter of the movie series up until now, I was horrified with the film. The first two movies were happily accurate, and I've watched them over and over. But this... this is not the Dawn Treader. This is some storyline that seems as though someone came up with it after reading a vague outline of the story some 20 years ago and has now tried to recreate it from memory, but failed. The mist? Really? That was a contained island with nothing in it but nightmares and one waterlogged lord, not some evil darkness seeking to take over the world, lurking and tempting and generally being a nuisance. And when they left it, just turned around and left it, it was gone. Poof, over and done. And suddenly it's the most important part of the movie? The plot line as it stands leaves much to be desired, utterly weaker than the previous two. And I don't blame them at all, because they weren't given much to work with, but the acting had definitely deteriorated. The musical score, so beautiful, heroic, and moving in the previous two, was not memorable at all. The movie in general was an insane disappointment. One would think that after the failure in the Golden Compass's plot ""liberties"" that they would know better than to take a much MORE beloved book and twiddle their fingers in it. I would hate to see this series fail before we finally get to see accurate interpretations of the later books, and maybe even someday, dare I say it, the Magician's Nephew?! And can someone explain to me why suddenly nobody is Spanish, including Caspian with his previously sexy accent? I had to go check to make sure he was even the same actor! Fail. Just... Fail. Please, try again, before Lucy and Edmond get too old. Please, please, redo, sticking to the quality, beauty, and accuracy of the previous ones.",2010

Loaded with action and adventure, really funny scenes where Eustace's attitude and twisted face provide many laughs, and spiritual symbolism that is so rich -- this film is a total winner! I loved Reepicheep's courage and dignity, and the virtue in spite of struggle of the Pevensies. Aslan comes through in the lives of those he loves in his perfect timing. Jam-packed with special effects, this movie is visually stunning and will be an excellent film for families with tweens and teens!

1,"The third video installment of the Chronicles of Narnia, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, was a very poor depiction of the story as was written by C. S. Lewis. Many elements were added to the story, altering it so drastically that it no longer deserved to hold the title ""the Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" The acting abilities among the cast were all very good, as well as the graphics and special effects, but the altered story was rather dull. The humor aspects and magical wonders would entertain small children, (though some scenes may frighten them) but older viewers may be able to see the poor story line as it struggles to entertain viewers for a long amount of time.",2010
7,Even when the first two installments of Narnia were no masterpieces somehow Disney was able to produce entertaining films ( maybe not with the visual quality of Lord of the rings)but on their own merits they were interesting enough to watch. When the first trailer of the voyage... came out it seemed that this was going to be very different from the previous two ( and not necessarily in a good way) Today my suspicions were confirmed and I have to say that this is by far the less exciting movie of the Narnia series. The pace is very slow for a fantasy/action movie and at many points the plot seems to go nowhere there's at least half an hour when absolutely nothing happens and when it starts to get interesting guess what the movie is over. On top of that the CGI was very poor for my taste it was nothing close to spectacular. I was going to give it a six but in the end my vote is 7 just because I liked some lines and the ending was emotional and a bit surprising,2010

I will be satisfied and 3D was great congratulations to strive for this movie I love and enjoy and I hope that people who watch this movie are satisfied as I was when I left the cinema.

7,"I thought this movie was going to be just AWFUL. However I was mistaken, it was actually pretty good. The acting, as I would've expected was mediocre, but no one in the cast was destined to shine in this film. I also had a good time watching the film, I was really happy how the Piranhas looked. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece like Citizen Kane or Schindler's List, cause you'll definitely be disappointed, but with a movie title like this, who would? Just go in expecting some laughter and have some fun with it. Also there's a lot of nudity and gore, so I don't advice parents to take your kids in theater to watch this film. Piranha 3-D lived up to its title, featuring Killer Piranhas with 3-D. It isn't in any way perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be.",2010
1,"Absolute dreck, which mysteriously managed to gain a myriad of critical accolades while rising to a far from impressive number 8 at the US box office. It has been a long time since we have gotten a fun Jaws-inspired rip-off, this does not qualify. The film is a wart on the butt of the original Jaws and fails to even come within miles of Jaws 2 or the original Piranha, both of which managed to be fun and suspenseful. An earthquake opens up a fissure to an underground cave housing deadly prehistoric piranha just shy of a Spring Break extravaganza. I love good trash or guilty pleasures and Piranha 3-D would certainly seem to fall within those parameters. It is completely up front about being trash, which I respect, but it also arrives acting like it is too-cool-for-the-room. In other words, it makes the mistake of believing in advance that it is great watchable trash...it is mistaken. Instead of crafting something fun and suspenseful from the set-up, director Aja has instead vomited forth a film so brutally repellent and disgusting as to defy belief. After a while, the gore literally ceases to have any impact. Aja has little interest in the characters populating his landscape of blood and fails to even make them ""types"" that anyone can be concerned about before they meet their gruesome fates. We have no concern for Sheriff Elisabeth Shue, scientist Adam Scott or any vested interest in whether Shue's three offspring will survive the onslaught. The visual effects range from adequate to clumsy, and the underwater 3-D effects are murky - proof positive that the film was converted rather than filmed expressly for 3-D. If character development is non-existent than suspense/excitement follows it down the same hole. The dialog consists of either screaming, a scientist-type pontificating a wild theory, or some variation of ""Let's get out of here"" or ""Look out"". Then again, it only has to function as little more than a bridging device between the next gore scene or the next boob shot. The film is awash in a ocean of boobs. There are bare breasts to right, to the left and storming the camera at every opportunity. Apparently, filmmakers forgot that their target audience would probably be dragging their girlfriends to this epic, so male skin is at a minimum. The film's ""highlight"" or nadir, depending on your view, is a roughly 10-minute orgy of violence with various partiers being devoured, skewered, ground up in propellers, torn apart, beheaded, etc., preferably women who somehow manage to lose their tops prior to being disemboweled. The film's idea of comedy is having Jerry O'Connell as a Girls Gone Wild-type sleaze merchant who gets his privates gnawed off on camera - oh the hilarity! The acting is not terrible. Perhaps Steven R. McQueen will have the luck of his grandfather after The Blob and go on to something better. Pity poor Shue, Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, et al., whose careers have apparently bottomed out to include chum like this as an option. Kelly Brook is lovely and seems classier than the film surrounding her, so no wonder Aja decides to destroy her physically near the climax, but not before graphically denuding her for the gratification of the sweaty adolescents in the audience. Then again, this is no surprise for a film that seems to view the entire human race as little more than bare boobs and geysers of gore. A truly disheartening experience and indefensible on any level.",2010
7,"Films rarely deliver on the promises of their trailers. Even their synopses can indicate a promise of something the final film has a problem making truly happen. Some movies come close, others fail miserably, and others deliver a different experience entirely. Piranha 3D is the rare film the delivers exactly what the trailers, synopses and every ounce of marketing promises – buckets of blood, campy humour and boobs – lots and lots of boobs.",2010
9,"For those of you who saw the trailer, you can already expect loads of nudity and gore. And if you walk in Piranha 3D (do yourself a favour and watch it in 3D, it's definitely worth it) expecting these things, then you'll have a good time. Maybe it will go down in history as being a cult favourite within 10 or 15 years from now, but it probably won't be nominated at the Golden Globes or the Academy Awards, and that's fine because the crew know that and only want to offer a really great time. Piranha is a film that won't please to everyone: After all, it's sort of meant to laugh of other horror movies that use huge chunks of blood and gore to ''scare'' you, without exactly being a parody.",2010

1,Not the worst movie ever made but one of the many that fall into the 1* is too much category. Sort of a Darwin Awards lake where the stupid offspring of rich people are sent to pass a rite of passage that involves surviving being slaughtered by fish that seem to be able to growl underwater. Those that survive run the country. Hardly a comedy as there are not a lot of laughs as only very immature 12 year olds would snigger as morons are shredded by the growling fish. Not really a horror as it was just a series of rather stupid death scenes that whilst gory were very boring. The CGI was adequate ....just....the acting....there was none. The characters were all idiots so it was impossible to care who lived or died. Not one scene that was tense or funny. Lots of nudity to keep 12 year olds with no Internet access happy and lots of bloody death in stupid ways to keep morons happy. But a story that a monkey would disown directed so badly Alan Smithee would be embarrassed to have his name on it and filled with acting a tree would be ashamed of. One interesting thing I did learn from this tripe was Piranha don't eat c#ck which was something Discovery omitted to mention.,2010
1,"I have seen some bad ""horror"" movies recently. This is #1 on that list! Whoever thought of this idea really is a genius - Girls gone wild with a few CGI fish thrown in. A majority of guys going for this movie will recommend it to other guys for that one reason...oh and Kelly Brooke! But that is not even a consolation prize. The fish were added as an after thought. The main emphasis of the movie was spring break and the underwater scene of Kelly B and that other woman. I can't believe I got sucked in by the trailer and the title!!!!! I went and saw this movie in the hall, to my eternal regret. I hope anyone who hasn't seen it yet and reads my words will heed them. Don't waste your money on this ""movie""!!",2010

Also Julie's son Jake (Steven R McQueen) is in a sinking boat in the very same lake WITH his younger brother and sister.",2010
5,"First...let me preface this by saying that the original Piranha and even the lower than low budget sequel Piranha 2: The Spawning were always fascinating films to me growing up. I also want to add that High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes remake were good films and Aja in my opinion had started to define himself as a contemporary Wes Craven. Mirrors was a step down but I looked forward to Piranha from the moment I heard it was being made. I didn't expect Citizen Kane. Gratuitous violence, nudity, obvious set ups I did expect. I expected and hour and a half of mindless entertainment. Piranha 3D offers you all of those things. What I expected to make the movie special was Aja's ability to create tension and set up sequences to involve the viewer. In this aspect the movie failed. Its starts off wasting a perfect opportunity to be clever with Richard Dreyfuss (in my opinion was wasted....yeah I got it I'm tired and I wanna go to bed) and it goes wasted. His demise and lack of dialogue are a perfect send off for how the rest of the movie is. It fails to shock or involve you. The next 45 minutes are cuts between Elisabeth Shue as the Sheriff investigating Dreyfuss disappearance and a big budget Girls Gone Laka Havasu. While the scenery is appealing it gets old and your waiting for the movie to get going. I was OK with this as long as the payoff was worth the wait. It wasn't. Jerry O' Connell was annoying, Adam Scott shooting individual Piranhas with a 12 guage was just foolish, Ving Rhames using the propeller to slice and dice the fish was stupid knowing he was killing himself. There are thousands and thousands of Piranhas yet somehow the two young heroines are able to kill them all by exploding a small boat, the mega Piranha was I saw that coming times two. All in all if you want to see a 3D private part eaten by a Piranha then spend the money. Other than that skip this one. Boring.",2010
1,Yes There is loads of Gore yes there is loads of nudity...however thats about all there is to this steaming pile of crap.. No Story no good script no Character Development whatsoever also has one of the lame-est ending i have ever seen...This movie plays off as a big budget girls gone wild episode with some killer pirhanas thrown in almost as an afterthought...while some of the gore affects were nice and nasty looking..a lot of the Cgi stuff was utter crap..Even the so called 3d wasn't in 3d and it shows just like Clash of the Titans..There is a few good points to the film Elizabeth Shue who did a good job and the Richard Dryfuss Cameo was Clever..however other then that this movie sucks..If they had spent more time working on a good script and giving us Characters that were worth a damn and less time or even no time on nudity and gore the movie would have probably been better...Thank god for the Original being on DVD because i can go and watch that and see what a good film is all about...Again Gore and nudity do not make a movie,2010
1,"It starts as somewhat of a what could be a good story line but soon becomes all that the movie is, girls in skimpy bikinis showing themselves and lots of gore. No solid story line, your not emotionally drawn to the movie unless you like naked girls getting hacked to death by fish. Just terrible. Sure the 3D effect was good, the fish were very real looking and make it stand out and I jumped and screamed each and every time they tore someone to death or swam by. It seems to me that the movie could have been more believable if it just didn't have an earthquake over the lake and let them out then just start killing everyone especially at spring break.",2010
1,"To paraphrase Freud, ""there are times when a piece of detritus is just a piece of detritus."" Similarly, there are times when a CGI weiner is just a CGI weiner. And on that same note, there are times when a heavily hyped 3D horror film manages to be so much less than the low standard it sets for itself. By the end of its 88 (mercifully fleeting) minutes, ""Piranha 3D"" had me wondering if a camera crew was going to enter the theater, revealing that what I had just watched was a practical joke before running the ACTUAL film.",2010

1,"Seriously? I really do not know why this movie actually is rated over six, because this is the biggest piece of s*** I've seen in my entire life. There are a number of reasons for that, but the main reason is that the movie has no soul, there is nothing that binds me as a viewer to it and it doesn't give me anything. It is supposed to be scary and funny. The movie is none of them. Just really sad.",2011
1,"Forget watching this and don't be drawn to it by the cast, especially with Richard Dreyfuss as he is written out in the first 3 minutes before the credits have even arrived. Ving Rhames is rarely seen, as is Christopher Lloyd. The film wastes the talent of Elisabeth Shue and Jerry O'Connell is a complete embarrassment to men and to himself. The film is complete rubbish and nonsense and the peak of it is when Ving Rhames pointlessly sacrifices his own life whilst standing in the shallows using an outboard motor on the piranhas. It will probably appeal to those who are 6-8 years but then it is rated MA for adults, so there's the dilemma. There's a lot of gaps, and lacks continuity. It seems that the producers were confused whether to make use of special 3D effects, or not then again maybe they exhausted their very small budget for it, in the end the effects looked quite amateurish. Also the producers seem to not know what direction that they wanted to go, as virtually all the attempted gore scenes were easily predicted. No shock value and hardly a comedy as there's very few laughs, it is just poorly produced, directed and the childish unintelligent script focuses far too much on (again) pointless female body flashes.",2011
10,"I really liked the original Piranha (1978) and the 1995 TV remake so I was really excited about the 2010 remake, particularly when I heard that it is in 3D and when I saw the trailer that makes you want to go see the movie. I have always loved underwater horror movies ever since I've seen the all time classic Jaws (1975).",2010
10,"I like French director Alexandre Aja ,the guy clearly loves the horror genre. His ""High Tension"" was a tribute to 70's horror flick and in many ways his latest films is a tribute of 80's horror film or as Aja himself calls it ""Guilty Pleasure"" films and in many ways I prefer this film because this is the type of film I just adored watching growing up. The film is gory as hell and I mean hardcore gory , limbs floating in the water , Girl cut in half , Fish fighting over a penis...Yeh they have that too. In fact it is without a doubt the goriest film since Peter Jackson's ""Brain dead"" (or ""Dead Alive"" for the US). If you love your film gory , don't waste any more time on here and go watch this film now. Of course this is not all this film has to offer , it has a great cast...a bit of a who's who of 80's stars.An Hilarious Jerry O'Connel (Stand by me) a beautiful Elisabeth Shue (The Karate Kid) and Christopher ""Frickin"" Loyd , seeing that guy on the big screen again his worth the price of admission alone (Even if it's a small part) sure he sound like his ""Back to the future"" persona in this film...but come on?...would we want it any other way? And let's not forget Richard Dreyfuss reprising his ""Jaws"" role for the opening of the film .. That on the other hand I was slightly disappointed with, they could have made the cameo a little bit more clever (see Zombieland to see what a perfect cameo is like). Ho and the 3d ? it's hilariously Awesome , I caught myself making ""push away"" movement at the sight of a floating penis , it's one of the best use of live action 3d I have ever seen on film, seriously this film has superb 3d and if you are a guy like me,there is a wonderful underwater dance with two girls...I was giggling like a schoolboy! To wrap it up Alexandre Aja did what films like ""Snakes on the plains"" failed miserably at , it gave us a pure 80's guilty pleasure film for the present day ..It is not the sort of gift that we will see often after this, so let's enjoy it while it's on the big Screen! If you know in advance that this is no ""Inception"" and that it's just a gory film that keeps winking at its audience and who does not take itself seriously at all,I don't see how you cant enjoy it. Serious Critic like Roger Ebert are probably going to hate it...And that means it's a really fun horror film you cant miss!",2010

I suppose it's perfect for a crowd that loves gratuitous violence and obnoxious humour, but this is probably the only movie that I would say doesn't have a single redeeming quality. The characters were garbage, the plot bland and predictable, the humour vulgar and vacuous and the violence nauseating and unnecessary. From reading other reviews, it seems the only people who liked this film are the mindless numnuts who want to see boobs and people eaten alive (often both at the same time in this...dare I call it a film?). If that's your style, stay home, watch a masochistic porno with a comedic sideplot and save yourself $12.",2010

Instead of wondering, who got what as a housewarming present, I was wondering if the theater would give out a refund 10 minutes into a movie. Guess I'm OK with skipping character development. Skyline picks up quick enough after the reset, I did like the movie. In other films, such as the recent District 9, character isn't really developed - the hero's character is revealed as he's exposed to greater and greater stress.",2010

And also way better than Johnny Mnemonic which is the gold standard by which I judge all bad movies. I actually liked Skyline. It was by no means a great movie but props to the film makers for skipping all of the alien invasion clichés and going with something original. One poster compared it to a zombie movie and I did notice the similarity when I was watching it. The plot does have far more in common with a typical zombie movie than you usual alien invasion movie. Also, way more realistic than any alien invasion movie I've ever seen. Independence Day was fun to watch but it was just cotton candy not serious science fiction.",2010

9,"Skyline was not the most fantastic movie I've ever seen. . While a bit slow to develop the movie does manage to convey a decent feeling of growing panic. However, the fact of a modest budget to realize a brand new type of alien invasion should earn it a little respect. That is the main attraction of this movie - New Aliens. It's not more predators or ""aliens"" aliens or new twist on greys(AKA - Independence day) but actual New Aliens. The movie doesn't spell out everything you would like to know about the invaders, but you should be able to get the gist of it. In My humble opinion a larger cast(forbidden by this budget) would have served the movie well. If a sequel is under consideration it should expand the setting, double the cast and delve a little bit more into the aliens(maybe a brief recent history or something). It's impossible to make an honest review without mentioning my dislike for the one-sided reviews that just want to label it an awful movie and possibly stick us with nothing but a neverending supply of sequels and remakes of already successful franchises. It really didn't deserve the 9 stars I gave it, but all the supercritics out there were just bagging it so unmercifully that I felt the need for a little counterbalance",2010

But I do prefer that there be enough scientific basis to a movie that it is at least plausible. Skyline goes so far beyond believable, its not even preposterous. An alien race arrives on Earth to harvest humans. OK, I can buy that. But not for food. Or any other believable purpose. They do it to harvest their brains so that they can....uh....put them in new alien bodies to make more aliens? Huh? Let's see, an alien can grab a person, violently rip their head off, and then pluck out their brain and spinal cord, completely intact and unharmed, with about as much effort as pealing a banana. Of course, that's believable. Nothing wrong with that picture. And then this brain is handed to a new (baby?) alien who sucks it in and shazam, a new, fully functional alien. Got it. So are we saying that this alien race can't procreate without human bodies to pluck brains out of? So how did they get started to begin with? ",2011

Having just been to see Skyline however, I felt numbed and cheated - I hadn't paid, but I still felt I was owed some money back... With no likable characters, a 'plot' that goes from bad to worse to literally nothing, it's difficult to recommend anything about the movie. I've already had my fingers burnt by the Brothers Strause before - when they took 2 much loved franchises in Alien and Predator and made their fans weep. That film, just like this one, has some cool looking set pieces but absolutely nothing of value to tie them together - totally refusing to give the viewer any reason to care about what they've churned out.",2010
6,"District 9 probably rejuvenated the science fiction subgenre of an alien presence / invasion on Earth all over again, with no less than three films lined up close to one another that tackle just that - Skyline being the first, then Monsters followed by World Invasion: Battle LA, where the latter had caused the Brothers Strause's Hydraulx effects company probable woes since there is what's deemed to be conflicting interest in The Social Network sense. That aside, Skyline demonstrates that an independently funded film is still feasible, with the usual merits and expected demerits that come with an effects laden movie, but certainly not one that deserved the kind of backlash that it got.",2010

Too many reviewers seem to forget that this is just a 50's style B-Movie with updated effects, it doesn't have pretensions other than to be enjoyable. On that level it works fine. It's better than Independence Day precisely because it is spare on script and characters, ID was spoilt by too many silly and annoying characters and ridiculous plot devices. This doesn't aim for any more than focusing on a small group in peril and it's all the better and believable for it. The special effects are stunningly good, shown, refreshingly, in full daylight rather than the usual dark / rainy shots (which seem designed to hide any flaws).

The charm and poignant detail of Planes is sadly lacking.There is no character development,we don't have emapathy for the nerd character,and by the end of it,I had none for R.D.J's character either.An embarrassment to R.D.J's great track record, a bitter blow to your pocket and expectations of an entertaining night out.This film sucks.",2010

Imagine how one would react to the antics of the other, and then on occasion, invert the reaction. (That adds suspense!) Re-write PT&A with more action by disconnecting the vignettes; this gives you the freedom to create disasters and then re-start the plot with the leads not dead or in jail, like Saturday morning cartoons. Here's your inspiration - when you do ""man slips on a banana peel"", don't be afraid to make the audience be the man, make them feel the pain of tailbone falling on concrete.

Its problem is that it's a little too bitter, thus eliminating with surgical precision any empathy we might have for its two protagonists.

A staple of screwball road comedies, these cheerfully disgusting stoners help steer their hard-ass co-passengers towards emotional closure with their man-child antics. The late John Candy specialised in them, and in Due Date Zach Galifianakis once again lollops up to the plate.",2010
10,"There had been in my humble opinion a major lack of entertaining and good comedies in the film market, but then out of the blue I stumbled upon The Hangover. A film I didn't know anything about before I went to see it in the cinema. Just a few seconds into the film I started smiling and laughing, and they kept on pushing it, and I think there wasn't one single dull nor boring sequence throughout the whole movie. The reason why I'm telling you this is because watching Due Date gave me the exact same amazing comedy experience as The Hangover, and that speaks for it self! ",2010
3,"We were quite disappointed by this film. After the first few minutes of finding the 2 characters amusing... I got bored. My friend and I actually sat there discussing other matters. We expected it to be laugh-out-loud funny but in the whole screen there were a few laughs, that was it. Everything was quite unrealistic, such as the car crash in which they both should have died, or stealing a Mexican police truck, causing others to crash without being reprimanded, or even being shot and walking fine 1 minute later.",2010
2,"I walked out of the theater after seeing this feeling agitated and wanting to just beat the crap out of someone...and I one who usually runs away when faced with conflict. I had heard that this was hilarious, so perhaps I walked in with excessively high expectations, but I was truly disappointed. I know that Zach Galifianakis relies on awkwardness and an appearance of being socially inept in his stand-up, which I don't generally enjoy, but I had seen him in The Hangover and had enjoyed it, but I did not walk out of this movie a fan of his. He does his schtick well, perhaps a bit too well, making it difficult to watch him. Robert Downey Jr. is very talented and was really the only reason I stayed through the entire film. He portrayed a man with anger-management issues very well, which also seems to be a bit of his ""thing"" as well.",2010
1,"I want to open this review by saying I am a 27 year old male who loved ""The Hangover."" I am a fan of RDJ and ZG, and think the majority of RDJ's work is way above par (at least the projects he chooses). This is my first IMDb review, and likely my last for a long time, unless more such as this comes out. The movie was so unsettlingly atrocious I felt compelled to warn others in the core demographic. ",2010
5,"I found this an uneven film, which relied on large wacky set pieces set alongside very serious (bordering on mawkish) emotional moments making for an awkward stop-start feel. Some plot points didn't go anywhere and others had nowhere near the possible comic payoff you were expecting.",2010
10,"Zach Galifianakis is so funny in this movie. The complaints about the stale plot, the ridiculousness of the characters' behavior, or the failure of the characters to garner a connection with the other reviewers- or to inspire love or empathy- may all be valid points. I didn't find this to be true, but one could see how others would make the case that the film was nothing special. Nevertheless, I just laughed hard and frequently at Zach Galifianakis throughout. 10 stars. That's all, I am adding lines because they have a minimum of 10 lines. I am not Gene Siskel. Just recommending a comedy; people take insignificant things too seriously",2012

However, he stumbles with the clumsy pothead and aspirant actor Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) that provokes an incident in the cabin and they are expelled from the plane and Peter is included in the ""no-fly"" list. Further, without his wallet with documents, credit card and money and luggage that remained in the plane and are delivered in LA.

2,"I'll sum this up in as few words as possible, first off, the movie sucks. ",2011
2,"Presumably, this was supposed to be a ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" kind of film. I didn't judge this, however, on that or any other specific film, to be ""fair."" Basically, this movie failed on every level possible. Downey, Jr. did reasonably well with what he had, but all other major elements were downright awful. I'll just mention one thing about Downey's character (Highman) though, which is that if he was given something to be, such as a gay guy who wanted to get back to California before gay marriage was made illegal, perhaps that would have helped provide some ""color"" (I'm not gay nor do I care about whether there are more or less gay characters in film; I'm just pointing out an idea that might have helped this dreary excuse for a film). Then there could have been a ""message"" about life's priorities and how our decisions affect others, rather than the forced ending of this movie. It could also have had an ""unhappy"" ending that would have been acceptable to the American masses (they don't get back in time and Highman and his partner must go to another state to get married).",2010
2,"If you think that making fun of an Iraq veteran is ""funny"", this film is for you. If you think that watching said disabled veteran attack the Robert Downey Jr character with a tire iron is ""funny"", this film is for you. If you think that watching Robert Downey Jr spit on a small injured dog, or punch a little boy in the stomach, is ""funny"", buy the ticket. Otherwise, save your money. Robert Downey Jr. is a fine actor. But why he would have descended to star in this appalling movie is absolutely beyond me. He must have really needed the money. My movie pal and I, who usually like ""buddy"" movies, and are not easily offended, found this to be simply stupid and very ""un-funny"". Some of the ""jokes"" are actually rather disturbing. Avoid at all costs!",2010
9,I've been very interested in watching this movie ever since I found out about it. I was a fan of Todd Phillips' The Hangover and through that I loved Zach Galifianakis. Robert Downey Jr. always does solid work. Through all of that I had high expectations and as with all expectations there is always a risk that they will not be met.,2010
7,"Maybe I liked this movie because I had such subterranean expectations for it. From the previews, and, indeed, just the title, I was certain it was going to be stupid rather than funny.",2010
7,"While the world was still recovering from the over-hyped Todd Phillips movie a smaller, quieter, but funnier movie slipped into cinemas and made a little splash. Both feature groups of troubled men looking for a good time, but Hot Tub Time Machine is just madder and more inventive.",2013
7,"Hell, it certainly kept me damn entertained. In this day and age it takes real comedy chops to pull off poo and vomit gags with such expert timing. The film embraces the absurdity of time travel and doesn't focus too much on the whys. All four of the male leads are brilliant, especially Corddry, who pulls off one of the great movie arseholes, without completely detaching himself from the audience. There are some classic lines, mostly coming from insults, and the film doesn't rely too much on date humour (just a few references to e-mail etc.) It cleverly spits in the face of the butterfly effect and relishes its characters manipulation of time, whilst showing that some things can't be avoided. A very entertaining comedy.",2011
7,"First off, let me say that I did rather enjoy this film.",2010
8,"I went to a screening of this film and didn't expect very much out of it. However, this is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. I laughed almost the entire length of the movie, which is something that hasn't happened in a long time. The movie is extremely well-written. John Cusack really carries the movie with a great performance. Chevy Chase really doesn't do much of anything. Comedy was sort of in the vein of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" The film doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is part of the fun. It doesn't really get bogged down too much in the science of time travel, and focuses mostly on these four guys trying to get the hell out of 1986. A great watch. Very entertaining. Highly recommended.",2010
8,"Although as a warning this movie had some pretty intense language, and very crude humor I enjoyed it so much. The actual plot of this movie as depicted on the trailer is in no way realistic at all which adds to it's humor. Isn't that what we go to the movies for? A little escape of reality for a while? This movie from first moment to last is hilarious in every way and the jokes keep rolling. This movie is like all of the greater 80's movies piled into one with a mix of Back to the Future. Every character in this movie had a significant number of hilarious jokes, and the entire audience was laughing hysterically. In my opinion this was better than The Hangover because every 2 minutes I found myself laughing harder and harder at every joke. Great movie.",2010
6,"The 1980's, it would seem, is back with a bang. Modern music is filled with synthesised melodies and dodgy outfits, fashion brought back leg- warmers (albeit briefly), big sunglasses, and tight jeans, and films have recently been taking a sentimental look back at a time when teen comedies, gory horrors and oiled-up muscle men action films ruled the roost. Yet it is a decade looked back at with as much disdain as it is warmth, pointed out by John Cusack's character Adam in Hot Tub Time Machine, as although he recognises it as the best time of his life, he states that ""we had Reagan and AIDS,"" and exclaims ""I f****n' hated this decade!"".",2012
9,"Hot Tub Time Machine is a much funnier movie than what the film title calls for. I didn't really know what to expect of this film but I got way more than my lowered expectations. This is a funny, sweet film that pays homage to the 1980's. This is a film that made me wish I was a teenager back in the 80's.",2012
2,"More so than with any other genre, I confess to being somewhat of a comedy snob. It's not that I have particularly highbrow taste, there's simply a very thin line separating what I find enjoyable and what I find intolerable. I will tell you that ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" falls squarely into the latter category, and to be honest, it's not even close to the line.",2010
1,"This movie is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I left the movie later than I should have because it never got any better. If you want to see guys throwing up, peeing, and discussing disgusting things with the f-bomb every other word...this movie is for you. It really makes me sad that nobody in Hollywood is intelligent enough to make a real comedy. It isn't funny, it isn't a movie you would want a child or teenager to see, it isn't a movie than anyone with any kind of values would want to see...just terrible. I don't even normally write reviews about movies, but if I can keep one person from paying to see this movie...I will feel okay that I paid to see it.",2010
1,"Saw this movie and had to punch myself a few times to stay awake. There is absolutely no funny moment in the entire movie what so ever. The story is lame and the acting performances are not to write home about. The story takes you back to 1986 and my age was 22 at that time, the very reason why I decided to go and see the movie. I hoped for some recognition but that never happened. The movie maybe a little funny for young people to watch but I sincerely thought that the makers of the movie intended to make a movie for people of my age. Furthermore I hope that my kids will not get the idea that the eigthees were really that lame as the movie tries to let us believe. To keep it short: watching this movie is absolutely a total waste of time!",2010
6,"""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is actually quite enjoyable. The ridiculous title and its obvious concept turned me off at first but it turned out to be a lot of fun.",2010
4,"For those of you who are saying that ""Hot-Tub Time Machine"" is the best comedy since ""The Hangover"", knock it off! You people are really delusional for thinking or even saying that... Rob Cordy has to be the most annoying actor in Hollywood at the moment and like Dustin Hoffman's character in Tootsie - Michael Dorsey - should be finding it impossible to get any work whatsoever!! I'm a huge fan of John Cusack (High Fidelity, Grosse Point Blank) but he just seemed so out of place here. ""Kick Ass"" as a comedy was by far better because for one it didn't rely on a big name like John Cusack & Chevh Chase as well as a ridiculous story line to draw people into seeing this.",2010
7,"I was a little skeptical when I heard the name of this movie, but it actually turned out to be very funny. The laughs were all in the right spots, hit the right notes, and kept on coming. What more can you ask for in a comedy? What I particularly enjoyed was how they played off the clichés that are usually associated with time travel movies. Also, the eighties references weren't ridiculous; they were just enough to make it work, and it seems like the writers did a lot of weeding to pick only the jokes that worked. Very refreshing since there are so many idiotic comedies that think they're more funny than they are. John Cusack was good as always, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. In fact, I think I could safely say that this was not a John Cusack movie, but rather an ensemble movie that didn't really have a weak link. There were also a few moments (I won't spoil them) that were excellent references and surprises. This one is a must-see if you just want to have a fun night out and laugh.",2010
10,"My friends and I just watched this movie, at a sneak preview. It was absolutely brilliant, but you had to have been alive in the 80's to TRULY enjoy all the references that are sprinkled throughout this movie. Rob Corddry goes completely against his previous typecasting, as the wimpy guy who gets bossed around by his girlfriend. He's the exact opposite in this movie, and he does a wonderful job. Jon Cusack does justice to his 80's movie pedigree. The feel of this movie is very much like The Hangover. A bunch of friends who come together to raise a little mayhem over the weekend, end up getting much more than what they bargained for. The comedy is superb, even though it's often sophomoric in nature. If you're in the mood to laugh like a hyena, and bask in the gloriousness of the 80's, then look no further. I can't wait to re-watch this movie on DVD. We were all laughing so hard, that I missed TONS of dialogue. There are also LOTS of 80's references, and familiar faces from the era, that make this movie so unbelievably fun to watch. Not to mention, give it excellent replay value. Don't wait for DVD, watch this movie as soon as it comes out! You'll be glad you did.",2010
1,"It's been a long time since I walked out of a movie. This one was so bad I couldn't justify the lost time sitting there like a moron watching the very not funny morons on the screen. I went because John Cusack was in it and figured he can only sink so low. I was wrong. He can't just need the money. I guess he needed something to do, but still. The characters were all just plain stupid, one being totally obnoxious but not in a funny way. Just obnoxious. An insult to anyone with half a brain. The plot, of course, is preposterous, but I knew that before I went in. It is possible to be creative even with a ridiculous plot. There was absolutely NO creativity present in this film (the first half at least, I just couldn't tolerate any more grossness and stupidity that just wasn't funny). Save yourself a few bucks and DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!",2010
3,"Another stupid thrown together comedy that makes no real sense, This is just a bunch of one liners and repeated jokes that get a giggle here and there but ultimately the movie just sits there and dies. The events leading to their time travel are just ridiculous, for some reason they go to a resort they used to frequent and the hotel is now a dump with cats walking around it's lobby and a bell hop who throws around your luggage and yells at you which is all very realistic but they stay anyway. They find themselves back in time because of a very scientific hot tub glitch and then when they realize they are young looking again they don't use it to their advantage at all, they cry when sleeping with hot girls and try to repeat their past without knowing that they have to or not. There are some stupid drug references, one guy does a huge line of coke then just stops, another guy takes a dozen bong hits, mushrooms and drinks a ton but is then sober ten minutes later. John Cusack's character has the hot young love of his life in a bed but refuses to sleep with her. The other one is 24 years in the past but can only think of his current ex wife. They are watching a NFL playoff game they know the outcome of but they still lose? Clark Duke is unfunny and is running around with Chevy Chase in some pointless attempt at cohesion. The black guy is sporting a Kid and Play high top haircut but is playing a Rick Springfield song on stage which in the 80's would be two totally different styles.",2010

1,"I am sorry for all those who have rated this highly. What did you enjoy? The plot was predictable, the humor sporadic and mostly exploiting boorish 21 - 35 year old male immaturity. Boy, I see enough of that in real life and indulged in some myself at that age. I really don't see how crass sexual innuendo with overworked lewdness is so appealing. Now, I enjoyed hangover a lot, so I don't have a problem with the genre, or the childish jokes, but this was different. If you haven't seen it, the plot predictably has the 4 protagonists going back in time to the 80s and examines the incidents that made them what they are today, giving them opportunities to change history a sort of Back to the Future meets Knocked Up. Unfortunately I enjoyed Knocked Up! Perhaps I am getting old!",2010
7,"What a stupid title for a John Cusack movie! John Cusack doesn't steal the limelight, instead everybody is given an equal chance to shine. When the opening scene had Nick putting his hands inside a dog, you know that what kind of a movie this will be. The characters quickly establish themselves as 'assholes' and if you can get over the initial nauseating feeling, you are in for a fun ride. I am a big fan of John Cusack and he has not let me down most of the times and he is a good bet to take. If you liked 'The Hangover', then you are going to love 'Hot Tub Time Machine'. The movie is very raunchy, over the top and gross, but in a good way. The chemistry between the main characters is spectacular. The music score is superb, so is the acting. Authenticity and common sense is thrown out the window, but just enjoy in this Hot Tub folks.",2010
6,"One of the most erroneous outcomes of a movie is when it can't decide on what its point is? In ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", the Achilles heel here is based on intentions. What is it trying to be? A feel-good tickle your funny-bone comedy, or a film to search for one's youth? Is it a story about forgetting your past and accepting what one has now? Or is it a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane about how your friends in the past don't connect with the friends you have today? Is it all I've aforementioned? None of it? Where the hell's the direction in this movie?",2010
1,I had read many of the comments in this forum stating this was funny but I have to say I was very disappointed.,2010

Some said it is like 'the hangover' but i'd say more like 'a' hangover. it hurts to watch, but so painful you almost can't get up and leave. and i thought 'the hangover' was really funny. adolescent humor is fine with me. 'hot tub time machine', however, seems intent on being semi-serious half the time and semi-funny the rest of the time. Chevy chase adds nothing to the movie. perhaps because most of the time he is a funny guy because he seems to be funny while acting like he isn't. so in this case he fits right in, and he really isn't funny, or serious, or anything. the only reason i didn't walk out was i had the night off and wasn't expected home so i didn't want to just go home. what a waste of time.",2010
2,"When I saw all the good reviews on this movie, I thought this was a ""can't miss"" movie. Boy was I wrong. This movie really had potential with the whole 80s theme and the reputable cast (Cusack and ""The Office"" dude). The first 10 minutes got me thinking this was going to be a great comedy. I was expecting something on the order of ""Tommy Boy"", ""Rat Race"", or even ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"". Sadly, it fell fall short of all these expectations. I would even rate ""Bio-Dome"" (with Pauly Shore) higher than this movie.",2010
8,"I saw the trailer to this film online and it seemed like a funny - yet unsustainable premise. I went to see it with friends anyway and I can't remember laughing so hard at a film in years. This movie takes a promising premise and knocks it out of the park. The cast is superb in this send-up of the psycho in the woods genre and the writing and direction take what I feared was an unsustainable premise and they give it surprising energy and humor. This is not Scary Movie crap. This is inventive and fresh and it has a beautiful heart. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the ""Hillbillies"" in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. Tucker and Dale never become plodding stereotypes of ignorant rednecks. They are portrayed with great wit and dignity and the actors never overreach or retreat into the safety and insecurity of broad camp. The cast trusts the writing and the director and it pays off. The script by Morgan Jurgenson and director Eli Craig is tight, smart and has a wonderful heart. These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC's 30 Rock. An especially guilty pleasure is the character of Chad, brilliantly played by Jesse Moss who channels some alternate universe version of a sociopathic Tom Cruise as the lead frat-boy. Eli Craig really guided home a winner with this film. The movie sets a course at the beginning and you know where you're headed in the first five minutes-- but Craig's the captain of the ship and this journey is filled with surprises and wonderfully subtle moments that give the film a fun trajectory and a brisk pace. You breezily travel through a fantastic, hilarious and utterly sublime entertainment. Bravo!",2011
9,"I did not have many expectations when I sat through this gem of a movie. This movie takes the horror/comedy genre to new levels. The plot is fairly simple, Lots of misunderstood situations that take place between Dale and Tucker and their fix-ur-upper vacation home, and some overly critical, unstable college kids. Very original script, good acting (Tucker and Dale are fantastic), and clever direction. How can a brilliant movie like this not make it to the big screen, yet movies like Season of the witch, Skyline, and Gulliver's Travels do. If you want to laugh till milk shoots out your nose, watch this movie. Should be on everyone's must-see list.",2011

""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"" does for the Hillbilly slasher/chainsaw massacre genre exactly what ""Evil Dead 2"" did for the demon possession genre and what ""Shaun Of The Dead"" did for zombies. It takes the well-worn, done-hundreds-of-times conventions of horror movies and turns them into side-splitting (as opposed to skull-splitting) humor.",2011

As an avid horror fan, I had no expectations for Tucker and Dale. I basically watch anything and everything, and seeing as this was low-budget with very little publicity, I underestimated this. It has since become one of my favourite movies ever. Alan Tudyk is fantastic as always, and I had never seen Tyler Labine before but he basically steals the show. While the films it's ripping are pretty foul, T+D still manages to have a lot of heart, and Labine's character is so adorable! This does for The Hills Have Eyes what Shaun did for Dawn Of The Dead, while kicking Zombieland in the privates. Unmissable. ",2011

10,"An excellent comedy with terrific horror elements, this was a crowd- pleaser tonight at DIFF, here in Dallas. This is what writing is all about, old-school, when writing actually mattered, over special effects. And there are plenty of those. It is rare that I actually praise an American film, only because we no longer care about writing. It's all about star power without chemistry or talent behind the scenes, just what might make a buck. And, clearly, even clear results do not stop ""the machine"" from producing utter crud. Relativity Media has bought this gem, but apparently has refused to market it ala Bounty Hunter. This is such a funny film that fits into Bromance, Comedy, Horror, maybe even Indie. Did I mention there's chemistry? Talent? Yup. All there. So, get on it, Relativity! This could be incredibly profitable. Wish my blog had more power to get the word out there. Hope this does the trick.",2010
10,"I've just seen this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest in Berlin and was  totally surprised of the high quality. I thought this would be ""just  another"" horror comedy you would forget instantly after leaving the  cinema, but with the fantastic acting of Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine,  the funny story and great effects, it works as well with the backwood  slasher genre as ""Shaun of the Dead"" did with zombies. The crowd in the  cinema went totally crazy about this film, they applauded and cheered  throughout the film and after the first positive reviews by bloggers  the screenings in Munich for example were sold out in just three hours  after starting the pre-selling. Totally recommendable, and I really hopes  this movie makes it to the cinemas worldwide.",2010

Although it may be a ""small"" independent movie, there is nothing about this movie to hint that it wasn't a huge multi-million dollar blockbuster. It was shot using the RED camera at 4K (that is a resolution of 4096×2160!!!), so the video and audio quality are superb.

Oh and if (or when!) you decide to watch it, do not watch the trailer under any circumstances! It spoils the movie way too much. ",2013

The film keeps a steady pace both in body count and laughs as Dale and Tucker a couple of lovable hillbillies visit their ""vacation cabin"" in the woods. The film manages to successfully send up every slasher stereotype including hillbillies, college preps, local sheriffs, and insane killers. I viewed the film with five friends and it took all six of us to catalog all the physical comedy, dialog and subtle plot twists that writer/director managed to utilize. I suspect that I will find more when I get the opportunity to see the film for a second time. Of course a good script still needs execution and the location work and special effects are excellent.",2010

Based on the trailer I thought OK, this was going be just a couple of rednecks in the woods making mistakes...but there is great character development in the movie and a great message in the movie that makes you feel good while you are watching the film. I don't want to give away any spoilers but lets just say if you see this movie you will laugh a lot and you will come out feeling good at the end of it. There is a lot of gore in the movie which just adds to the film rather then take away from it. Yes Tucker and Dale are hillbillies but they are far from the most ignorant(with the exception of why the deaths around them are occurring) characters in the film.

10,"I had a chance to view this movie, and I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Dale & Tucker vs. Evil is pure genius. You can not compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead or any other Comedy/Horror film. It is in its own genre. Purely original, purely great from start to finish. I recommend this movie to ANYONE with a sense of humor, and also to those without, as this movie may create one.",2011
9,"With hicks and horror having made such good bedfellows for such a long time, it's only natural that the concept should be exploited for its comedic value, and ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" is brilliant in this regard. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are the title characters, two likable good ol' boys who just want to relax and have a good time at their newly acquired vacation retreat, a run down old rural cabin. Into their lives come some rowdy college kids who get the wrong impression of Tucker & Dale, even more so when one of their own, Allison (Katrina Bowden) has an accident, Tucker & Dale come to her rescue, and the kids, having already formed their opinions of the pair, interpret the event negatively. As a result, they keep launching assaults on poor Tucker & Dale that end badly, with the kids managing to gruesomely kill themselves over and over in the process. ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil"" is extremely bright, engaging, and knowing comedy taking a delightfully satiric approach to standard genre filmmaking. Granted, by nature of its story, it eventually, understandably turns into the very thing of which it makes fun, but it's still very entertaining right from beginning to end. Not only does it make fun of certain stereotypes, but people's own preconceived notions, which can well be formed by the weight of so many straight faced movies of this kind. And it even works in a heartfelt message about self-esteem into its mix with real deftness. Written by director Eli Craig and co-producer Morgan Jurgenson, this is high energy filmmaking that's often breathless enough, and compulsively watchable, that one may truly not notice the time passing, it's that enjoyable. What's great is how well Craig and Jurgenson set things up just so they can be interpreted in a negative way, such as the incident with the bees. The movie doesn't skimp on the gore, either, but it's always spun in such a funny fashion; as soon as we see that wood chipper, we're primed and ready to see it in action, and when we do, the result is uproarious. Actors Tudyk and Labine, two engaging guys who really ought to see their stars rise after this, are perfect as Tucker & Dale. The lovely Bowden is an immensely appealing actress playing an immensely appealing character, who by the way is another case of embodying the whole idea of there being more to this person than meets the eye. And Jesse Moss is a real hoot as the demented frat boy hellbent on going after Tucker & Dale who's in for a very apt revelation that the character couldn't have anticipated. And, in closing, while the whole ""therapy"" session does slow things down a bit, it's quite revelatory itself - how often in this sort of story do we actually see the opponents actually engage in a bit of (hopefully) civil airing of grievances? Craig and his wife Sasha play the cameraman and reporter in the pre-credits sequence. Nine out of 10.",2012
8,"A nice little surprise this comedy-horror flic is... it pits a couple of well meaning hillbillies against some very confused and douchey frat boys, in what turns out to be one bloody good time. ...As per slasher film 101: A bunch of college kids head up to the lake for a camping trip...run into two hillbillies...they judge a book by its cover and get creeped out. What the college kids don't take the time to notice is these 'hillbillies' are just two sweet old country boys headed to the same lake to work on a 'vacation cabin,' not the blood thirsty backwoods cannibals they leave believing they are...let the misunderstandings begin. ....TUCKER & DALE is well done, fun to watch, has some great deaths and doesn't take it self seriously, which is why it works. It's a great spin on the killer in the woods idea and the paranoia those movies have created in the mind of 'city folk.' I had a blast with this one...the kills (which are all by accident and misfortune) are cool, gory and funny and there are a bunch...so by all means sit back, fire up the old NetFlix instant streaming and watch this one...

9,"This drama is about three lonely people each living in different countries whose lives become indelibly connected in an unforseeable, yet touching way. The story centers on Matt Damon, an American, who apparently has the psychic ability of contacting the recently departed, however, he believes that this ""gift"" is a ""curse"" because it renders him a social outcast. There is also a French woman who has a near death experience and a troubled British boy grieving over the loss of a loved one.",2010

10,"For some bizarre reason, marketers opted to make Clint Eastwood's latest work look like a rejected script to an M. Night Syamalon movie in its trailers. What with its catastrophic events and plot centric imagery, you'd think Eastwood had made a disaster movie rather than what the reality turns out to be. This is a much more thoughtful film about death that examines how living characters deal with the aftereffects. Matt Damon's character, Lonegan, is not a protagonist but one character in a larger ensemble piece. Naturally, it benefits marketing to try to isolate this certain aspect of the plot to make this look like a thriller, but it is a impressionist character piece by all means. Even the psychic aspect is played down, and never truly explained.",2010

10,"Clint Eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. The style and structure of storytelling used in Hereafter will not appeal to a large audience, but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly, didn't care and rightfully so. Because let's face it, he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. And with Hereafter, it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. A very beautiful one at that.",2011
8,"An emotional film (bring some hankies) exploring the love of children for their mother, the loss of a loved one, and the near-death experiences of the two main characters. The acting is superb, particularly the young McLaren brothers and Cecile DeFrance. I applaud Clint Eastwood for taking this risk and creating a solid piece with riveting emotions and a fantastic conclusion. The only leap of faith that must be taken is the belief that George (Matt Damon) truly has this gift/curse since it is the thread that weaves through all his relationships. This is truly an enjoyable movie and adds to my belief that the greatness of a film is not in the critic's eyes but in your own. This is the second sleeper movie of the week for me. The first one was RED...a great, entertaining movie.",2010

Peter (""The Queen"") Morgan's screenplay on 'life after close encounter with death' is seemingly simple yet full of spirited (pardon the pun) ingredients. There are vignettes depicting different social strata of life situations: rich and famous in the French television media and European publishing world as we follow a career-driven female journalist; quietly solo 'blue-collar worker' shying away from exposure of his 'possessed gift' in San Francisco; struggling addict, London single mom dealing with custody of her boys and the lone twin attachment to his lost brother. Morgan skillfully scripted three intersecting story lines inclusive of contemporary social elements and events: natural disaster, bomb attack, fatal accident, culinary classes, corporate meetings, company layoffs, foster care, book fair.",2010

I had heard virtually nothing of this movie since its release late 2010 and had a very different sense of what genre it would fall under. It was neither overly sentimental, cheesy, or ""hollywood."" Although a significant part of the movie does take place in the US, there is a beautiful foreign film feel to most of the movie. Matt Damon easily gave his best performance to date, wonderfully understated yet full of palpable emotion. The french actress and the young boy actor were also marvelous. This is by no means a short film, particularly by recent standards, but I hated to see it end. I loved being so surprised by this film and am glad that I took a gamble on this one lazy afternoon.",2011

7,"Life after death. Yes. The big question. Here 80 year old maverick Clint Eastwood present us with a cinematic feast without arriving to any final conclusion. How could he? The first quarter of the film is riveting, compelling, jaw dropping. Then, Matt Damon takes over. Let me be clear, I think he is a good, competent actor but I can't, ever, divorce myself from the actor and marry the character. I'm far too aware of his ""acting"" I have the feeling that Eastwood hires his actor and lets them to their own devices. Sometime that's a good thing but some others, like here and ""Changeling"" it is clear that more direction of actors was needed. Specially the children. Here as it was the case in ""Changeling"" the children seem kind of lost. Bryce Dallas Howard makes a bizarre contribution to the film. Unconvincing and down right annoying. And, I must say, I miss opening credits. I hope this fashion ends quickly. The appearance of Martha Keller took me out of the picture. I recognized the face but I couldn't put a name to it. The nagging thought distracted me away from the story. A problem that, with opening credits, could easily have been avoided. I'm rambling. I liked the film and Eastwood should be applauded. Still exploring, still taking risks. Well done!",2010

But this movie does have its strong points, it was quite funny and entertaining.

I was actually angry that I paid money to see the third film and really didn't want anything to do with the ""Shrek"" franchise any longer. To my surprise even after hearing nothing but complaints about the third one, the final chapter of the Shrek saga was still being made. When I saw the trailer for ""Shrek Ever After"" I was less than impressed probably because I was still angry about the last film.

It's never going to compare with the superior first two, but if Dreamworks Animation really wanted to conclude their beloved property with this, they might as well give it all that it has. SHREK FOREVER AFTER, while certainly more elaborate than its immediate predecessor, is not the most original of the series, but if this is really a happily ever after for Shrek, at least he went out on a good note rather than a disappointing one.",2010

This one has recaptured the fun of the franchise while potentially being the darkest one in terms of plot. Alternate universe stories have been done to death, but the appealing nature of so many of the characters makes this one work, as well as the fact that the filmmakers are clearly trying to wrap up the story (which includes a small bit of retconning at the beginning, but it pays off toward the end). The 3D occasionally falls into the trap of throwing things towards the audience, but the characters and sets are so beautifully animated in all dimensions (the textures of Shrek and Donkey, particularly, have improved even on the wonder that was Kung Fu Panda) that the 3D actually adds to the enjoyment. The first two remain the crown jewels of the franchise, but this is a worthy addition and a suitable end to the... well, saga is too strong a word, so storyline will have to do. And the bonus?

This time Shrek (Mike Myers) is unhappy with the monotony of marriage and fatherhood and goes to Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises to magically give Shrek a day in his old ogre lifestyle if Shrek willingly gives up a day in his childhood. What Shrek doesn't know is that Rumpel has been after the throne to Far Far Away ever since Fiona (Cameron Diaz) was locked in the tower and Shrek signing his life away is the perfect opportunity for the crazy little dwarf to take power. Not only that but since Shrek technically never existed, nobody remembers him, not even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or Puss (Antonio Banderas), the kingdom has been ravaged by Rumpel, and Fiona has given up on finding a knight in shining armor and become one herself. This all amounts to some harmless stuff for the kids basically, which is kind of sad since the first two were such clever fairy-tale satires. This fourth and last installment in the series plays out predictably, relies on the same stale themes (love conquers all, life was never meant to be a fairy-tale), goes for the easy jokes (poop, pee, belch, and Puss has let himself go for the fat gags), and also relies way too much on characters with funny voices or who sing and dance to pop culture songs. This is also the first in the series to be presented in 3-D but the unremarkable action doesn't even come close to warranting a 3-D viewing. While not as bad as ""Shrek the Third"", ""Shrek Forever After"" nevertheless feels something like a direct-to-DVD knock-off that might excite kids looking for some mild entertainment, but I think even they'll notice that Shrek has lost a step.",2010

Unlike the second and third movies, this one doesn't introduce any new characters that are in the least big interesting or funny.

5,My biggest problem with this so called final installment is the fact that the entire movie does not need to exist. The plot itself is something that screams 'no more creativity'. Let's take a look shall we? ,2011
9,"Buried is a film that keeps things deadly simple, one character, one location and a one line but horribly inspired plot, those looking for flashy visuals or big action should turn far, far away from this one. It's worth noting though that the film is well directed and photographed, director Rodrigo Cortes has a nimble eye for visuals and angles to keep things visually interesting, while cinematographer Eduard Grau gets the best out of the mere two light sources to make the experience a frighteningly vivid one. The plot sees Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin, with nothing more than a cell-phone and his lighter to help him out, things develop through his series of fraught, occasionally bleakly amusing and increasingly desperate communications with the outside world. Its rather interesting to see a film so based around interactions on a mobile phone, devices so often objects of fear, suspicion, or in the case of some horror films and of course the cinematic experience for the viewer, irritations. Here every ring is crucial, the battery bar is nail-biting, even the light of the screen is important. For me, just as interesting was the choice of lead. I've never had time for Ryan Reynolds, a face from some of the worst in lowbrow comedy and someone I never expected to appreciate breaking through into not just serious film but something as bold in its structure as this. A lot of people are likely to dislike the film on a fundamental level, but Reynolds gives the performance of his life here, running through a rainbow of emotions, angry, sarcastic and terrified are but a few. Compelling and sympathetic, likely physically arduous too (though I'd don't know how the film was made it must have been tough, barring serious trickery) he holds the film wonderfully. The script is of course of utmost importance too, and writer Chris Sparling does mostly terrific work. An ordinary man reacting as best he can to a nightmare, drawing on the sort of resourcefulness he probably hoped he'd never need, occasionally breaking down but keeping ploughing on, shades of dark humour in the protagonist's travails on the phone, its endlessly interesting and as time goes on, nail-bitingly suspenseful. I had minor issues with realism in the film, and there was at least one interesting little aside that could have been developed a bit more, but overall this is a great achievement. It surely won't appeal to everyone and my rating might seem generous, but for doing this well on such a risky concept, and putting together a suspenser that remains thought provoking after, a 9/10 from me.",2010
10,"I caught this gem at Sundance earlier in the year. It was part of the 'Park City at midnight' group of films, which showcased horror and thriller movies, and played them at, can you guess? Midnight. I saw Buried on the last night of the festival, Ryan Reynolds wasn't there, but both the director and writer were. It was a small theater on Main street, very artsy in it's look. But once the film started I had eyes only for the screen.",2010
6,"It's a bit hard to review this special movie. You can't go into special effects because there were non. You can't say anything about the cast because it's just one person you see. And the set is simple too, just a coffin. Yes, indeed, it all takes place in a coffin. So that's already tricky to watch because I know a lot of people who didn't liked it because there was nothing to see or watch and I must agree with them. It takes indeed almost an hour before the suspense comes in. The first hour you will learn everything about the character, perfectly played by Ryan Reynolds. But it's all done on phone. Of course, being buried you can't do anything else than phone but for me it was a bit too long, an hour as I said. But from then on it goes faster and things go from worse to terribly wrong. The ending was a surprise for me. I won't spoil it just watch it. Still, I won't state it as a horror either a suspense or thriller. But you have to experience the coffin setting to sit it through. Simple story, excellent camera tricks.",2011
9,"I hate it when fantastic movies such as this get completely overlooked when it comes time for awards to be handed out. Buried is a triumph in minimalist filmmaking and is a heart wrenchingly intense movie experience. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and terrifying. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a box. Paul Conroy, who is played by Ryan Reynolds and is the only character in the movie we actually see, wakes up in a coffin buried under the ground with no idea how he got there or who put him there. He shortly finds out that he is being held by ransom by a group of terrorists in Iraq. With only a pen, a flask, a cell phone, and only 90 minutes of oxygen, Paul has to act fast. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredibly thrilling experience.",2011
9,"If this doesn't remain in my top five come year-end I will be shocked. Who thought that a movie can not only sustain a full 90mins stuck within the confines of a coffin (and believe me, it doesn't leave the coffin) but that it would be one of the most cinematic and audacious pieces of cinema I've seen in a good few years? Like this year's Inception and Toy Story 3, movies like Buried are the reason I love cinema. It is escapism at it's best, ironic considering the setting. Who thought Ryan Reynolds, Van Wilder: Party Liaison himself could be so utterly mesmerising in such a challenging role? The movie is literally his. Sure, there are those he speaks to over the phone (he's buried with a Zippo and a Blackberry) but for the film's length, he is the only physical presence on screen. He goes through every emotion possible: fear, panic, anger, sadness, happiness, depression, acceptance, and all of it played so convincingly that you almost wonder whether they genuinely buried the actor and left a camera in there with him.",2010
8,"I wasn't expecting this film to be set entirely within a coffin and nor was I expecting Ryan Reynolds to be much good. As it turned out I was wrong on both counts! Brief summary:Ryan is a contract driver in Iraq whose vehicle is attacked by Iraqis. He wakes up in a coffin buried underground with a few ""helpful"" tools...and so ensues a claustrophobic, frustrating and scary journey for both the character and the audience! I found Ryan's performance quite compelling and was almost living the experience with him, I even found myself holding my breath at times and feeling quite panicky! The fact that you can't see what is going on above ground adds to the tension and you are never quite sure what to believe.",2010

7,"Original and ingeniously basic premise full of suspense and intrigue in spite of developing only one scenario. Paul (Ryan Reynolds) is an U.S. truck driver working in Iraq . After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes up to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. He encounters within the coffin a working phone, which allows him contact with the outside world. With only a lighter and a cellphone it's a race against time to getaway this claustrophobic death trap . Paul must rely on his owns resources to survive , taking on serpent and burying .",2011

9,"A man wakes up to find himself locked in a buried coffin with nothing but a cell phone, lighter and a flask of alcohol. That's the simple premise for this unique thriller. Ryan Reynolds brings his acting talents to a role that breaks from his usual comedic style. The film's 95 minute running time is completely dependent on Reynolds and he delivers a completely believable and realistic performance. ",2010
9,"Buried: in which Ryan Reynolds is en-tombed underground in a coffin like structure with only a cell phone and a lighter for company spending 90 minutes crying out for help to anyone who will listen. Director Rodrigo Cortes keeps the drama entirely inside this average-sized coffin-like box but as anyone who watched Hitchcock play with space and tension in Rope and Lifeboat will know how inventive one has to be with limited room, Cortes used his skill to make this experiment work brilliantly with some interesting lighting effects to keep it visually interesting. After watching this movie I was left physically trembling. This was partly because the final five minutes are about as nail-biting as five minutes of film can possibly be, but mostly because of the tremendous adoration I have for the filmmakers who have achieved so much with so little. Whoever says you need to think outside the box should think again, because Buried is nothing short of a minimalist masterpiece. bravo for a very brave ending.",2010
1,The movie is full of flaws. The lighter burning during most of the film?? How much oxygen does he have. He also uses the lighter to look at the screen of his phone which has a back light and nearly has as much light as the lighter. The snake comes out of nowhere and disappears into nowhere.,2010
1,"Seriously this movie is just disappointing!!! A very, very stupid guy in a coffin trying to figure out how to survive but doing absolutely nothing worthwhile for 90 minutes... :( It takes a few minutes then you really dislike the guy! OK so its very sad for him he's buried alive in a coffin! I'll give him that! But after fumbling around with the Zippo lighter for what feels like YEARS - he should get the point! He's in a coffin - he needs the oxygen and YET HE KEEPS BURNING THE STUPID ZIPPO LIGHTER! Even after he finds a telephone with more light than the Zippo he still uses the LIGHTER who consumes all his oxygen.... ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? And everyone who's ever held a Zippo knows how hot it gets if you burn it a long time... Not only that but he spends most of his time talking to people who gives a damn... or doesn't believe him or he's horribly rude to people! And so many things are just done for the action and are so not believable... The snake for instance... if it can get IN the coffin and OUT again so can he! But no he has to use the brandy or whatever it is in the cantina to start a fire and burn all the oxygen! He has the knife from the bag that he doesn't find before the KIDNAPPER informs him its there although it has LOTS of thing in it! And whats up with that ridiculous call from his employers?!? Even people who doesn't know ANYTHING about lawsuits and insurance can hear that he should hang up that call after just the first few sentences but he just lies there and answers! Seriously after that I almost wish he just dies! Thats how obnoxious he is! Thats how illogical he is... He keeps doing so many stupid things in that coffin that you just can't believe it!!! And yes its not even original - People have been buried alive in movies so many times - and yes the CSI episode probably is fresh in memory but at least Nick Parker doesn't behave like an obnoxious little brat for 90 minutes so I'd rather watch that episode ten times than having to ever re watch this horrible, horrible movie!!!!",2010
1,"Buried has an interesting concept to work with... man stuck in buried coffin, limited supplies and oxygen... yadda yadda yadda. But the filmmakers decided to make the story and the protagonist (Ryan Reynolds) dumb as bricks, which basically tanks the movie. There are so many flaws in Buried that it's beyond irritating and makes you demand your 95 minutes back; from the constant use of a lighter when there's supposedly limited oxygen, to the inability of the protagonist to stay calm for one second and figure out an escape plan instead of shouting into a cell phone from beginning to end. Any thrills or intrigue are quickly stifled by the aforementioned poor writing and trademark Ryan Reynolds school of douchebaggery acting.",2010

1,"Amazingly for once the movie critics actually like a film. This movie is well liked by critics and generally has received acclaim from different festivals, including Sundance. Also as per usual is the critics' keen eye for being horribly consistent with their poor choices. They hate and pick on great movies and love the awful ones. ",2010
1,"Strongly advise against seeing this film I have to admit to being this bored only a very few times in a cinema. The plot is predictable, including the death of Mark White, and frankly repetitive. This film was very much an attempt, in my eyes, to be the new ""Blair Witch"". The entire film being shot in the coffin was a poor attempt to offer atmosphere, the cinema screen being large and not offering any claustrophobic feelings. Also, I heard several people snoring during the 4pm showing. I won't tell you the comments at the end of the film, due to the guidelines we need to stick to. 1 out of 10 is a generous review for this waste of 95 minutes. Zero would be more accurate.",2010
1,"The plot is a guy with a zippo lighter and a mobile phone is trapped underground in a box for 90 minuites while the oxygen runs out. That is literally all it is a guy in a box. The guy winds everyone up that it is possible for him to such as wasting his phone battery, accepting calls at stupid times most of which are either pointless video requests or being put on hold. He literally calls everyone he knows before calling people worth talking to and does not figure out how to change the language setting until half way through. He makes fires and spills chemicals no wonder this man died after 90 minuites in a coffin. The ending is poor as the man dies after just being told that they are digging up the wrong guy. One that they had said earlier had been saved.",2010

9,"I was quite excited for having the opportunity of seeing this film at Sundance yesterday. Luckily for me I don't get claustrophobic so I wasn't deterred from seeing the film like some I've spoken to. Initially I was concerned at first as to how a film could remain interesting when its complete focus was on one character trapped inside of a box, but with multiple twists and turns throughout, I was amazed at how engaged I was in the film and found myself quite literally sitting on the edge of my seat.",2010
7,"My rating: 3.5/5  Honestly this movie looks like it was made with a budget of $1000! And  most probably the director have used a wooden box with Ryan Reynolds in  it and few cameras in the whole 135 minutes. But despite all that,  seriously 'Buried' is not a bad movie at all. It's just purely new and  tense to look at and more enjoyable than many other high budgeted, cast  crowded flicks.   Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds-The Proposal, Just Friends) is a truck  driver who works in Iraq. After getting ambushed and attached by  insurgents he gets buried alive in a wooden coffin under the desert  sand. Its rather a box which is a little spacious than a usual coffin  which immediately comes to our minds but not spacious enough to be  comfortable. He discover a lighter, torch and a cellphone and some  other small stuff which makes sense when the plot start to reveal its  true colors. Later its exposed that rebels expects to demand a ransom  and so the story goes.   What purely fascinates me is that the movie never, I repeat never  leaves the wooden coffin. There are lot happens in the box and lot of  interaction with the outside world but all other people involved are  limited to voice acting. This gives an immense opportunity for the  viewer to be practically get stuck in the box with the main character  and just feel how he must be feeling. On top of that the fear mixed up  rage and frustration which builds up is wonderfully crafted throughout  the movie. I'm not gonna give out any spoilers about the ending or what  really happens in the box coz I really enjoyed the movie coz I never  knew much about it.  Ryan Reynolds does a wonderful job with his character. The roll is very  tough with limited moving space and lot of overflowing emotions. Very  good work done there for sure. And hats off to the sounds crew  including the dramatic score which play and huge part all the time.  More than any other movie the sounds really becomes so important in  this as visuals are not the key player for your imagination.   Overall 'Buried' is a very nice and scary experience. If you ask anyone  about their most deepest fears are, buried alive would be in the list.  Coz I know as it remain on a top position of my list.",2011
1,"If you are going to watch this movie, please fast forward the first hour because it is extremely boring, predictable and frustrating. A guy in a coffin makes a bunch of phone calls from his blackberry. Yes, the blackberry can take it all, fire, dust. Nice commercial. Thats about it. ",2011
8,"Death Race was many miles away from reaching the same levels of black humor and intelligence from the original Death Race 2000, but it nevertheless kept me entertained mainly thanks to its main actor and the violent automotive sequences. And even though there did not seem to be too much material for a sequel, the studio Universal did not vacillate to exploit the home market with Death Race 2, released straight-to-DVD. Strictly speaking, this is not a sequel, but a prequel, something which allows a better distribution of the low budget with which it was made. That's the reason why Death Race 2 leaves the stunts for the ending (with one exception), while it skilfully uses the first hour to establish the origin of the death races, as well as the motivations from the villains and the anti-hero. And I have to say that the final result is a very entertaining experience.",2011
6,"Be honest, was the 2008 Death Race film (itself a remake of the 1975 B movie Death Race 2000) actually avant garde cinema? No it was not! It was a loud, visceral, simple action movie; all style, little substance in the grand Paul WS Anderson tradition. This cheap direct to video prequel, not a sequel as the ""Death Race 2"" title might seem to imply, is just more of the same. Heck even the main characters looks the same only with different names.",2010
7,First things first. This is a mid/low budget sequel following a partially successful remake of a classic 70s cult movie. So it is obvious that this film is going to blow!,2011
9,"If there is a straight to DVD movie that is good than this would be your cup of tea. Now i was not a huge fan of the first one it was just a fun action movie with lots of deadly car crashes. This one almost tops it and believe it or not the acting is not horrible for a direct to DVD smash up. If you are bored one night and just want to watch a fresh and fun movie go get this. This movie takes place before the original and how Frankenstein was invented. Don't expect academy awards won here, the action scenes are done very well and the racing was done just as well as the first if not better. If you are looking for popcorn fun than this would be it.",2010

6,"DEATH RACE 2 is a surprisingly entertaining little straight-to-video sequel to the Jason Statham starrer, itself a remake of a Roger Corman cult classic of the 1970s. I'd even go so far as to say this is as much fun as the first film, although it has only a fraction of the budget and only one returning cast member, as far as I can tell. For DEATH RACE 2 captives the vibrant, adrenaline-fuelled spirit of the first film and Dutch director Roel Reine, himself a veteran of a dozen B-movies, proves to be a better director than Paul W. S. Anderson.",2013

The crime boss who sent him out (Bean) is afraid he will testify against him and sends in assassins to the prison to make sure he doesn't. First of all, if you haven't seen the first ""Death Race"" I would start with that (you will get some of the call-backs), but I would say its more like the ""Star Wars"" prequels...you can watch in either order and it will still make sense. I loved the first movie and was very leery about a direct to DVD prequel, but I was very surprised. There were a couple characters from the first one, along with a few ""set-ups"" that happen in the original movie. I would say this is more of an origin story, it explains the origins of the death race and the character of Frankenstein. Most sequels/prequels are never as good as the original (especially direct to DVD ones), but this is a rare exception. The first Death Race is still the better movie but this one holds up very well. I give it a B+.",2011
8,"I expected close to nothing from this prequel to the entertaining DEATH RACE, as most Direct-To-DVD Follow-Ups are mostly terrible. Not the case in DEATH RACE 2. This ActionThriller made for little budget in South Africa features some fine Actors (Sean Bean, Luke Goss) and some well known faces like Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames. Its a veritable cast, and they seem to have some genuine enthusiasm for the material. Sean Bean is credible as the slimy Mob Lord and delivers a fine performance reminiscent of his Bad Guy-Character in Bay's THE ISLAND. A bit strange is the late introduction of the titular Death Race itself, but we get to see how the Game evolved from a primitive Cagematch to the brutal Race we got to know in the first part. Thankfully the dutch director Roel Reiné knows how to keep the story going and interesting. There is a lot of back story and dirty corporate politics going on, which is handled nicely. Some inspiration can be traced from the sleazy Capitalism portrayed in the classic ""Robocop"" and its evil Company OCP, spliced with modern Reality TV Sensationalism. It works rather well, and YES I think the storytelling in DEATH RACE 2 is more solid than in the W.S. Anderson-""Original"" (Yeah, I know its a Corman-Remake). Definitely worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to DR3. If the Producers are smart, they keep the Director, he has a talent for tight, brutal and exciting Exploitation-Cinema. Thumbs up!",2011

7,"This movie was actually pretty good. A decent story line, decent special effects. The main character is a bad guy with a heart, someone we all can relate to. It is good to see the origins of some of the Death Race characters. I always wondered how 'Lists' ended up in jail and where they found that iron prison warden lady. But it is a shame that we all know how it ended for Luke, he dies in the first part of Death Race. Danny Trejo played a decent role as the crew chief but I would have rather seen him smashing someones brains in. The double storyline is well executed, Luke tries to race is way out of prison and his former boss wants to kill him. It is great that one of his crewmen tries to kill him, if he did not try it, the whole storyline was unconvincing. All-in-all a pretty good movie about love, crime and auto racing.",2011

4,"When I first heard there will be a sequel to ""Death Race"" 2008 version I was a bit excited since I enjoyed watching the first one. But than later I found out that this would be a direct to DVD release which got me disappointed. I guess the first movie didn't do so well at box office, cause if it did do well I am sure the sequel would have hit theaters and would have had a way bigger budget. Budget for a movie doesn't show how good or hot bad it is in some cases, but for a movie like this it needed the extra budget. Everything just looked way too cheap, if they just didn't have the budget to make at least a decent sequel they shouldn't have tried in the first place. I liked the original Frankenstein from the first movie, although that scene with him was very short he still had charisma and seemed like a cool character with a cool voice and this is from just the first few minutes from the first movie. In this movie Frankenstein lacked the cool voice he had in the first movie and didn't have that big of a charisma. The acting is also bad and the stupidity in this movie gets irritating to watch. The slow motion sequences in this movie was just ultra lame as well. On a bit of a positive note, it had few decent scenes that had it's moment, which is why I am giving this movie a 4.8. And because it's a straight to DVD movie so being a bit lenient.",2011
1,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have had the chance to see this year. (It was a almost identical story to the Death Race 2008 - only far far worse) The 2008 version at least had a bit of originality, this drivel looks like someone sat down and watched the first version and then tried to copy it and simply adjusted a few parts of the story to try not to make it a complete rip off! They even tried to make Luke Goss look like Statham, it was sad to watch, no wonder this rubbish has gone straight to Video - it made me cringe to watch it.",2011
2,"Before I start let me just say that I should have liked this movie, I really should. The remake, which this is the sequel for, was an great little 'leave your brain at the door, sit down and buckle up' movie. This however is just bad and not just in a could have been better, but in a could hardly have been much worse kind of way. I can see what the producer has tried to do. Take a successful movie, copy the format, but don't spend very much money on cast or plot. From what I can tell two members of the original cast, those playing List and K14 (I cant be bothered checking up the actors names) reprise their roles, but add next to nothing to their respective characters. The other characters are almost carbon copies of those from the original film. You have the white shaved head pretty boy (Luke Goss in for Statham), the big black man, the white supremacist, the ice maiden pulling the strings, the craggy weather worn mechanic (Trejo replacing Mcshane), the sexy female prisoner and the Mexican (i assuming here, as his screen time last about 30 seconds as he's introduced and then killed). The plot is dreadful, full of holes but still tries to explain the origin of the original Frankenstein, who dies at the start of the remake. As a result the cars don't turn up in the movie until almost an hour in. This hour is filled with some poor set pieces with lots of slow mo. I would just like to take this moment to let the director know, that in my opinion, slow mo doesn't give the film an element of class or sophistication, but just takes up running time. There are exceptions however, with filmmakers such as John Woo and Peckenpah who use it to accentuates the violence and not use it as some cheap art trick. None of the set pieces have that 'wow' factor seen in the remake when the big artic turns up. The fights are poor and appear clumsy, but this is more a case that the bar has been raised so high with fighters from previous years, that this film really struggles. Plot holes are plenty, my favourite, if that is the right word to use, is how they managed to change a 69 fastback Shelby mustang into a 2009/10 Shelby. Some will argue that they would have got a new one, but they clearly explain that everything they will need is already on the island, but using a '69 so prominently as a plot tool was a massive error. Okay maybe thats a little anal, but it still annoyed me and just don't get me started on the moment a car manages to keep a missle behind like a scene from Top Gun. The acting is pretty grim as well. Luke Goss, who was really rather good in Blade 2, just cannot match Captain Cardboard himself Jason Statham and is throughly unconvincing. Sorry Luke, but that accent was shocking as well. Trejo is well Trejo (take from that what you will) Ving Rhames just phones it in as the mogul in charge, or Ceasar as he calls himself at one point, and what the hell is Sean Bean doing? This man can act, he has proved it time and time again? Here he's playing a crimeboss caught between the loyalty of a friend and the loyalty of his wallet. I though his worst film was the Hitcher, not anymore its not. The sound design is dreadful, worse than Die Hard 4, with many notable moments when the lips don't synch and the sound effects and music appear rehashed from the first film. I could go on and if I were down the pub with you I probably would. If you want 100mins of auto carnage with a stupid story that will leave you content at the end, just re-watch the Statham film, you'd feel much better about yourself.",2011
6,While watching this movie (not having seen the first for a couple years) I was kind of bored and the dialog / acting was definitely B/C grade material (the Jason strathom look a like too is pretty pathetic)... The last 10 minutes makes up for it all so if you watch this movie stick it out to the end. Immediately after watching this I went out and picked up the first death race all because the ending left me kind of pumped.,2010
6,"Being a fan of the previous Death Race (2008), I decided to check out Death Race 2 to see how well it is and because of the cast. Death Race 2 is pretty alright but it isn't as great as Death Race. Death Race 2 basically shows the life of Carl ""Luke"" Lucas (Luke Goss), how is sent to prison, racing in the death races and how he later became known as Frankenstein. The film has some good action sequences that are quite brutal yet funny and entertaining, specifically one scene with Danny Trejo. Death Race 2 follows the same formula within the plot as Death Race but they change a few things. Death Race 2 isn't as good as Death Race because of the story, the action sequence and stunts, and the chemistry between the leads aren't as good as in Death Race. I was expected more. Nonetheless, Death Race 2 is still very entertaining for fans, but don't expect too much. The ending of Death Race 2 is real good and I think ends neatly. In general the film is pretty good but it could have been better.",2010

A convicted cop killer Frankenstein (Luke Goss) was forced to participate in the Death match within the Prison. He wins the match. Due to outbreak of the prisoners, the death match was officially discontinued. September Jones (Lauren Cohan) comes with the idea of Death race and Ving Rhames makes it worth with the reward of freedom of the prisoners. Probably another sequel will be made on this title. The original movie was quite entertaining. This sequel fails to meet the expectations of the fans. Totally a mediocre movie with some flaws in it.

2,"There are two kinds of bad movies: The so-bad-it's-good, and so bad-it-hurts. But then, there is Killers; an amorphous blob that exists in a vacuum where no films has ever been made before. It's not a comedy in the sense it's assembled out of jokes and humorous conflicts -- Killers constructs its own parallel universe reality and giddily makes fun of it. And it's not an action in the sense that good guys and bad guys chase one another -- Killers' has a snake-eating-its-tail moral stance. Killers is Meta in the truest sense of the word, and it's not even aware of it.",2010
6,"The story of ""Killers"" is familiar, with a twist. Jen (Katherine Heigl) is vacationing in the very scenic town of Nice with her straight-laced dad (Tom Selleck) and alcoholic mom (Catherine O'Hara). There she meets the suave Spencer (Ashton Kutcher). They fall in love and eventually get married. Little did Jen know though, that three years later, the ghosts of Spencer's old job will come and wreak havoc on their seemingly perfect suburban life.",2010

7,"This one's not half as bad as most of the reviews here make it out to be. The film makers aren't pretending to make a classic or even competing for the Oscars. It's a fun film that you will either like or not like. It doesn't take itself seriously. How can a movie that has Ashton Kutcher playing a trained killer working for ""some"" government agency. Ashton plays it a little campy, almost like a comic book character and that works, Katherine Heigl is her usual self. It's always good to see a beautiful Hollywood actress not looking like skin and bones. Tom Selleck plays Heigl's dad, a slightly predictable character. While the movie might be very predictable, it has its funny moments and while the pace isn't break neck, it does keep you entertained. Well, it entertained me.",2011
6,"""Killers"" is a romantic comedy action film, but starts out by failing on all accounts.",2010
6,"In this day and age, the standard of fluffy rom-coms has sunk so low that any film of that type that doesn't leave me fuming and offended as I leave the cinema gets a tremendous amount of goodwill from me. It sounds like the easiest thing to do; make a silly piece of brain candy that is so fun and silly that you forget that it has no cultural or artistic value whatsoever. Well, unfortunately, if recent memory serves me (and believe me, it does, vividly) there have been some absolutely horrific examples of the genre in the past year. Killers, fortunately falls into the former category of inoffensive nonsense that provides giggles, thrills and a good spirit. Killers opens with lovelorn Jen (Heigl) on holidays in Nice with her parents, disturbingly comic alcoholic Catherine O'Hara and protective and stern Tom Selleck. As they check into their hotel she meets half-naked Spencer (Ashton Kutcher) and, as any woman would, falls head over heels in love with him. What she doesn't know is that he is a CIA hit-man who is in town on a mission to blow up a helicopter. However, soon after he meets Jen he decides he wants a clean slate and quits the CIA forever. Soon they are married and loving every minute of each other and their life. However, it isn't long before Spencer's old life catches up with him. This film is not very inventive, nor does it tickle the funny bone as much as it could but it really is an enjoyable romp with a genuine sense of good intentions. The chemistry between the leads is great and, as a couple, the characters match well enough for the audience to engage with them. Heigl is a bit bland as always but she is likable enough as the vulnerable and fastidious Jen. However, it is surprisingly Ashton Kutcher who provides the warm heart of the film. We all knew he could achieve levels of comic genius at time with his portrayal of lovable moron Kelso in That 70's Show, but who knew he could give an underwritten character like Spencer some depth. There is a pleasant mix of heroic integrity and underlying sadness to Spencer, and this lends the film some subtle but much-needed poignancy. I suppose one of the most admirable things about this film is that it allows the audience to feel for Spencer but without falling into the third act sap trap. This is a silly film, with nothing much to say. It is 100% fluff and doesn't pretend to be anything else. But Ashton Kutcher proves a likable leading man and a pretty cool action hero, which raises this to the status of decent popcorn movie. Do not expect anything inventive with this film, but take it for what it is and you might just have a great time!",2010
2,"I'm sorry but there was no way I was ever getting into this one. Beforehand the title annoyed me (did anyone really think this would be edgy in the least bit?) and I was not buying Ashton Kutcher as a spy and it was pretty obvious from his past work he wasn't going to ""suck me in"" as the movie went along. I know everyone is sick of Tom Cruise these days and frankly he plays a spy way too often, but at least someone like him looks the part. Kutcher in this role is just Hollywood trying to usher in a new generation for these movies and it's just better off left to someone a little older with some better acting chops (Clive Owen or someone? I dunno). ",2010
2,"ONCE in a blue moon there comes a movie which hits every criteria spot on, and Killers has honed all of its attributes in order to make a truly, unequivocally bland and forgettable hour and a half-worth of tosh. Newly single Jen, played with no charm or skill by Katherine Heigl, is on vacation with her parents when she meets her ideal man Spencer, just about acted by perennial action figure Ashton Kutcher. The pair fall in traditionally quick fake movie love and get married. Little does Jen know though, her new husband is actually a secret government spy who kills people for a living and is trying to settle down. The fact that Kutcher looks in or around 30 years old and is playing the 'I don't want to kill people any more, whimper and sniffle' card does nothing for the integrity of the storyline. It wasn't until I looked at my watch either that I realised nothing more than that had actually really happened for the first 45 minutes. The trailers portray the premise of the film as an unwitting and clumsy Jen being dragged into a kill or be killed quarrel between Spencer and assassins hired to kill him because he's a liability in suburban life. However, it's nigh on an hour into the woeful film before anything of significance even happens. They say start as you mean to continue, and director Robert Luketic has done just that; he began with a barrel-full clichés played without any conviction and then went on to provide the audience with nothing more than an homage to every action rom-com in a drawn-out montage. Admittedly, neither Kutcher or Heigl has strayed far from their comfort zones, which in many ways has served against them as the pair seem almost complacent in their efforts to make the characters believable. At times there is a childlike playfulness between the two, but even that serves to the detriment of the film as the standard appears not wholly dissimilar to that of an amateur school drama production. Even the dry wit of Tom Selleck fails to provide much consolation. He brings experience and a touch of class, but the poor dialogue he is handed just proves too much for him to salvage. In fact, probably the best thing about the film is probably Tom Selleck's infamous moustache, partly because it doesn't get any lines. Occasionally in the movie industry there will be two promising actors who carry a film, perhaps struggling to shoulder the burden of a lacklustre supporting cast which doesn't communicate well through inexperience. However, it is never a good sign when you literally find yourself wincing throughout a film at the sheer lack of chemistry between its two leads. Perhaps the best testament to the lack of quality in the film is that Katherine Heigl cannot even scream convincingly, which is strange seeing as she has so much practice throughout. The shining light of Heigl's career so far was Judd Apatow's Knocked Up, which seemed to set up a potentially promising career. That being said, she now seems intent on penning her name to any bit part rom-com coming her way. Yes, she may have got the kooky, loser-in-love part down to a redundant tee, but it is evident from this that she needs a charismatic cast and script to support her, otherwise she appears as nothing special at all. As for Kutcher, the six foot-plus husband of contrastingly skilled Demi Moore could quite easily have been replaced by a large slab of granite with more personality. By all means, if his niche is sub-standard romantic comedies where he can run around topless for as long as possible, he deserves a typecast Oscar. If he wants to be taken seriously as an actor though, it's time buck up his ideas or just take on twittering full-time. Couples eager to find a movie which suits them both should undoubtedly hang on for the hotly anticipated Cruise-Diaz summer smash Knight and Day. Such a promising movie would really have to go some to lower the bar set by Killers. From the trailers, Knight and Day looks to straddle the line of satisfaction for both sexes incredibly well, whereas Killers attempts to do the same but gets lost in an insipid void somewhere in between. Maybe I've been a tad harsh, it was never intended to be an Oscar winner or one that would go down in the record books I'm sure, but I just can't help thinking you'd have to be void of at least four out of your five senses to really enjoy this.",2010
3,"In my book, a comedy has to be, first and foremost, funny. Killers was not funny. I didn't laugh once. The film was predictable, tedious and shockingly performed. The plot is also utterly incoherent.",2010

3,"First, the good things: Rolfe Kent's music was very good through much of this film. The setting of the early part of the film (presumably largely shot in Nice, France) was quite lovely to see. Other than that, well... this movie was painful. The chemistry between Heigl and Kutcher was limited to her giggling at the first sight of him with his shirt off, and even then felt forced. I was feeling bad for all the actors involved, but least for Kutcher and Heigl who seemed committed to forcing a laugh out of intensely dull witted dialogue in situations which have been worked into much better films (i.e., Mr. and Mrs. Smith, True Lies, Grosse Pointe Blank). And by the way, ""jessie-36,"" I, Michael Phillips and you are all ""real people in the real world"" (so I would believe having not met you or Michael Phillips so far as I know). You are also, guess what, now a critic. The destruction of newspapers as a valid critical forum has more to do with corporate economics than anything else. Celebrating the demise of the local newspaper sounds like so much whistling past the graveyard rather than a people's overthrow of those awful, awful critics. So, I'm afraid ""jessie-36"" that you are a critic (you should be if you're going to theaters to ""watch over 100 movies a year"" for free (!)). Based on your review of Killers, however, you may just not be a very thoughtful one.",2010

1,"I am really a fan of Kathrine Higle, she's really really beautiful and classy. But honestly, she needs to reconsider her choice of movies or change her whole movie surrounding, because obviously whoever is getting her into those silly movies is lame and has no creativity! In the last three movies that I saw for her (27 dresses, ugly truth and this one) the lame stories are the same, the filming techniques and direction and exactly the same, the lame and silly jokes, and the shallow comedy is exactly the same. The only thing she's changing is the pretty boy and the plot (not that any of the plots is actually meaningful to anyone in the world!).",2010

1,"The things we do for friends, it was girl's night and for some reason my girlfriends just love chick flicks. I hate them, very rarely do we have a rom com that works. Killers was one of those movies that I really did try to give a fair chance, but let's face it, with this cast could have I expected more? Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl, these two have zero chemistry and the jokes are so forced that they don't even seem like they are enjoying making this film. We fall into the typical clichés and beyond predictable moments and the characters are just horrible. You wanna hear something that I'm sure is just hilarious to you, the girl's mother is a very sick alcoholic who has a drink in every scene, so funny, right? The characters pretty much take murder very lightly and accept the fact that most of America is trying to kill them. The twist is lame and the story is stupid. No wonder this movie was not screened by critics, because they knew that this film was bad and did not put any effort into making it, so why should we care as an audience? Anyone who thinks this film was awesome or funny, I feel just bad for them.",2010
3,"Kutcher is barely believable as a secret agent and Heigl was even less entertaining. Spencer was probably the worst secret agent ever on film as he is beaten up by every person in which he has a physical altercation with. There was some chemistry between Kutcher and Heigl but no where near enough sparks to save this farce. The brief exchanges and references made about marriage are somewhat amusing but are nothing new. Heigl is becoming settled in a particular type of character. This one was no different any of her last roles in romantic comedies such as the Ugly Truth, Knocked up, or 27 Dresses.",2010

If u wanna watch a movie with ur friends and talk over the movie practically not paying attention to the movie well rent it on video when is released. jajajaajaja. Ashton kutcher should stick with funny movies. He sucks as a killer. and i don't even want to talk about Katherine Heigl. well i mean:""?^%$ I preferred Cameron diaz( what happens in Vegas) or maybe Brittany Murphy( rest in peace)much better in the movie just married.This where good funny movies.

2,"I was ready for a cute, fluffy ""romantic comedy"" kind of movie, with some action scenes spicing it all up. But this failed on many levels: 1) First and foremost, there is zero chemistry between Kutcher and Heigl. Just none. I'm having trouble recalling a moment in the movie where they even kissed.

7,"So the book has been proved false. Does this mean that the ""true story"" isn't true after all? There have been many claims by others that it is fact instead of fiction. Whatever - it doesn't matter, Peter Weir's ""The Way Back"", this movie about that book, which tells the tale of gulag escapees and their harrowing journey to freedom, is a well-told and inspiring tale than anything else.",2011
8,"This is a film for people who appreciate epic landscapes and survivor stories. It has some engaging characters but not brilliant dialogue or complicated characters. Mostly, it is a visual film, displaying the vulnerability of a few people in a harsh, vast, beautiful landscape. They must depend on each other, and they develop an intimacy based on their shared struggle rather than on deep conversations and emotional revelations, or at least, not until a young girl joins them. Weir seems to be commenting on the yin yang of masculinity/femininity at times in this film. I also liked the subtle underlying commentary on the brutal oppression of the Soviet regime under Stalin.",2011
10,"This was a long film but I was unaware of the length because I was so thoroughly engrossed. The scenery and the photography were simply spell binding but more than that, this was a story about the indomitable spirit of people faced with desperate odds told with sensitivity and at times, humour. Others have commented on the quality of the acting, the accuracy of the story and the cinema-photography; I want to comment on a different aspect of the film. We hear and see a great deal about the crimes of the Nazis during this period but very little about the crimes of the Soviet system. This film is not a ""dull metaphor"" of the Cold War as one reviewer has said If this films sparks a little enquiry amongst its audiences it will have done a great service to the memory of Poles and other eastern Europeans who suffered the double tragedy of Nazi and then Communist occupation. When Nazism was defeated in 1945, half of Europe was just beginning a sentence in Communist bondage that was to last another thirty five years. This aspect of the story is all the more effective because it is told through the eyes of a small group of people and at a personal level. At the end of this film, the entire audience sat still for about fifteen seconds. There was not the usual end of film scrum. People just needed a moment to absorb what they had sen. This was the best film of the year!",2011

10,"Anyone familiar with Peter Weir's incredible body of work - particularly his earlier Australian-produced movies - knows that a new Weir movie is an important event indeed. Almost all Weir's too-infrequent movies are at least noteworthy (Witness, Dead Poets Society) if not downright great (Year of Living Dangerously, The Last Wave).",2010
9,"Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir (""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""The Truman Show"") directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for ""The Way Back"" based on the book ""The Long Walk: A True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins, and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess (""21""), Ed Harris (""The Rock""), Colin Farrel (""In Bruges""), Saoirse Ronan (""The Lovely Bones""), and Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes""). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.",2011
8,"The story of a small group of people escaping from a Siberian Soviet prison, part of the ""Gulag"" in wartime and walking 4000 miles to freedom looked a trifle grim in the trailer, but Peter Weir has managed to produce a rather beautiful film out of it, using Bulgaria and Morocco as locales rather than Siberia and the Gobi desert. Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both ""Mr Smith"" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.",2011

Exotic and grandiose shooting locations contrast nicely with the all-too human struggle for survival of the characters. ",2011

8,"Having read several books about escapes from Siberia, I was interested in seeing one of them put on screen. I say this because the film is a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter.

8,"Now the question that is raised regarding this film is 'is it true?' There are a lot of suggestions that it is not, and Weir is deliberately vague at the beginning where he says that he 'dedicates this film' to three men who reportedly appeared out of the Himalayas in 1945. He does not suggest that this film is based upon of true story, though it is based upon a book by a Pole named Slawomir Rawicz, who alleges that he escape from a Soviet Gulag in Siberia during a blizzard and travelled over 6000 km to freedom. However, documentary evidence suggests that this did not happen, but rather that he was freed and sent to Iran. Another story is that Rawicz stole the idea from another Pole who made that claim, and further, there is a suggestion that the British in India debriefed a trio who had claimed that they had walked from Siberia.",2011
7,The computer graphic images were very good--most people don't realize how much of the film is computer graphics...most of the scenery...the make up effects sunburns etc...even Irene's swollen feet.

Several hours after I left the theater, I kept seeing everything – a meaty sandwich, clean water flowing from the tap – through the prism of ""The Way Back."" I'm a long-time fan of director Peter Weir, who gave us classics like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Witness"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Weir has outdone himself.",2011
4,"Good movie, even though its a bit false to claim that its based on a true story. Because its not.

He was set free in 1942 because of a general amnesty issued by the Soviet authorities and joined General Anders polish army stationed in Russia in the war against the Nazis.

One inmate declares he knows a gap in the fence and a group of inmates decide under the cover of a winter storm to make a run for it. They manage to get away, far into the surrounding forest as the blizzard rages around them. But being free of the Gulag doesn't mean total freedom, not only do they have to fight the elements, but there are wolves as well a bounty given to locals if they capture runaways and somehow of course they have to get out of Russia.",2011

The film is very well acted on all parts, and most impressively in my opinion the best actor nod would go to Colin Farrell! The film is a power house of emotion about a journey to freedom, and the trails and tribulations these brave men struggle through. The film is very well paced and the cinematography is simply break taking. I was also taken back by the fact that this film was inspired by a true story, and believe you me when the end credits role you will understand why they had to make this story into a movie.",2011
2,"*** WARNING this contains some spoilers *** I don't know where to begin with this movie. I was expecting something better organized and put together. I am a big fan of this type of genre-films like The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, The Shawshank Redemption etc. I was waiting for this movie to be released for quite some time, but after seeing it a big disappointment came to heart. The movie starts off very well, and begins to captivate the audience right from the start but as soon as the prisoners escape the compound the movie starts to dull out. Some of the things i really didn't enjoy in it were some of the scenes that were shot in the forest. In those scenes you could tell that it was a still studio shot because the trees and snow looked really fake. That is not the case with all the scenery you see in the movie thou. Another thing was the audio and sound bites, if you pay close attention when the young kid goes missing in the forest, when they search for him and yell out, the echo you hear just plainly ""screams"" we are filming in a small studio. I must admit i really found the movie to be kinda boring after the escape, there was not much plot and climax, and the poor dialogue between the actors was unsuitable. Another thing is, on top of things, I mean come on Collin Farrell playing a Russian thug... i was expecting his role in the movie to be more versatile, so he is got a knife, so what? He doesn't use it very much and after you see the other escapees talk amongst themselves and saying that they should take him along for the escape because he has a knife you would think that you would see some hunting/survival techniques etc. but you don't. You see Collin Farrel with a blood stained shirt bringing back some food and vodka that he loots from a village they cross paths with. Overall i rated this movie a #2, and i must admit it hurt to do that, the lowest score i ever gave a movie since i been on IMDb.com from early 2000's and that is just because the only thing you could find worthy in the movie in my opinion its the scenery, it's what saves the movie from being deplorable.",2011
10,"I haven't seen a film like this in ages, I can't even compare it to another. Fun for the kids and adults too. A kid starts middle school, making the transition from grade school and this film nicely deals with that chapter in a kid's life. The ""cool"" older brother who lives to antagonize you, the ""yukky"" baby brother who embarrasses you, the nerdy friend who makes you look bad, they're all there. Who can NOT relate? The direction is perfect, the film is paced properly and exactly. ",2010
9,"I haven't read the book by Jeff Kinney which this film is based upon, but one thought struck my mind, and that is Ferris Bueller just got younger! For all his wisecracks, smart alecky ideas and attitude, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) just reminds me of the time when Matthew Broderick took on the Bueller role, though this time round it's got less to do with cars and girls, but everything to do about surviving middle school, just about the time before puberty kicks in for him.",2010
10,"We went to see the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movie this past week with a number of adults and kids and I have to say that everyone absolutely loved this movie. There is something for everyone to relate to in this movie, young or old. It stays true to the book which was a concern all of us had before seeing the movie. However, you don't have to read the book to enjoy this movie. In addition, the adaptation from the book to ""silver screen"" was one of the better ones I have seen and the transformation captured the essence of the story intact. There were a few additional scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book, but they kept in step with the story and didn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film.",2010
7,"I went into this movie with an open mind going with my girlfriend and her 8 year old brother who really wanted to see this. I knew it would be a portrayal of how movie makers makes middle school seems but since it is a movie it was pretty funny. The leading stars were very likable as I was smiling basically the entire time. It was a rather short movie but enjoyable that goes through one full school year showing how tough it is for this one individual and how hard he tries to become popular. The main character Greg Kind of comes off as a rude and full of himself pre teen student as he tries to change his bestfriend who is a little chubby and a funny red hair goofball. He becomes more popular after a certain incident which causes an argument between the two childhood bestfriends. Overall, It was enjoyable for the whole family including adults, teenagers and of course the children. There was no cursing or sexual content which was pleasant in this movie. The parents are likable as well as they are actually suportive unlike other movies but the older brother is of course an annoying, punk rock wannabe who picks on the younger brother which gets old quickly. In the end, I was happy i went to go see it but not to sure if I recommend it but definitely if you or your children has read the books. Its not bad but not the best book to movie series or children's movie either.",2010
6,"I really enjoyed the movie. The movie depicts the life of a teen Greg (Zachary Gordon) who has his issues of longing to be famous in the middle school.He ranks himself 19 on the popularity list.He has a dream to fulfill.He considers his previous friends 'who were not able to grow up' according to him ... morons and tries to maintain his standard by keeping his distance from the infamous.His best friend Rowley however though weird in his ways,as Greg considers him 'still not Middle school ready',keeps on posing a threat to his popularity position. Chloe Moretz has a wonderful role herself in the movie however her appearance is short.But the story is however about the wimpy kid and hence that becomes justified.There are a lot of funny moments in the movie and you would smile every now and then on their innocence.There is one another character Fregley- Greg places him at the last position in the popularity list. There is this funny moment wherein whoever touches the piece of stale cheese is considered to have THE CHEESE TOUCH. Whoever touches that person takes with himself the cheese touch.Even a cockroach was concerned about its dignity. No matter how hard he tries he always gets branded every now and then as the douche.Eventually however Greg learns that it really doesn't matter if one is on the top of the popularity list in the school but what matters the most is being on the top of the list of your best friends. A little act of genius and sacrifice vindicates him eventually. I found the movie totally enjoyable as guys we were kids once remember after all ! We used to consider some little and petty things as important, didn't we ? The sequel to the movie - Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules is set to hit the theaters in March 2011 and I'm looking forward to it as well. The movie was really cute and I wish everyone watches it although I'll give it a 6 as it wasn't excellent though but the movie is highly recommended if you want to relive a part of your past.",2010
10,"My son has been waiting for this movie for months, so as to not disappoint, off we went expecting a lukewarm kiddie movie. NOT THE CASE!!! My husband and I laughed often and loudly. As a elementary physical education teacher, I really enjoyed the take on the middle school coach. It was a charming, off beat and entertaining. It was also especially timely, since my son heads off to middle school next year. I left the theatre and called my other teacher-moms with children that loved this series and told them to run, don't walk to see this. Great story,surprisingly clean and enjoyable. Not your typical kids movie. My son told me as we left the movie that the story didn't exactly follow the books, but as we all know, they never do. The transition from a cartoon book to on-screen real life people was wonderful! This will join our home library when it comes out. And ""yes"" I do plan on buying my son a shirt with our faces screened on that says ""I love my Mommy"" for his first day of middle school. Well, only if he gets out of line between now and then ; )",2010
3,"I'd say that the name of Rodrick's punk band ""Loaded Diaper"" (spelled ""Loded Diper"") was a perfect metaphor for summing up this dreary, over-rated film in a nutshell - 'Cause, to me, all this film amounted to was just being a ""loaded diaper"".",2014
2,"This movie takes the cake for being one of the most offensive kids movies ever made. It teaches them bad morals and accepts bullying as normal and fun. Its based off some books with doodle sketches in them and is about Greg who is bullied every day by his brother and others and how he has awkward stupid friends who obviously look like aliens. Now Im not blaming the kid actors here because Zachary Gorden does a pretty good job as Greg. The kid actors try hard to work with a sh- I'm sorry IMDb, Awful script. The worst parts are when the characters blatantly lie to each other and be mean. This is one of the worst and most unpleasant parts of the film because I do not want to see that. I want to see a good kids comedy. NOT THIS. This is one of the worst kids movies ever.",2013
6,"The film was similar to ""A Christmas Story"" in relating the troubled life of a 'tween in school, but came nowhere close to being on the same level. I was disappointed.",2010
7,"This movie was actually a lot better than I expected, and had some hilarious moments. I can relate to some of the things that happened to Greg. I have not read the book, so I couldn't compare it. 12 year old Greg Heffley is nervous about starting middle school. Him and his dorky best friend, Rowley Jefferson try to fit in and become popular, but that's easier said than done. Throughout the school year, Greg and Rowley come up with weird ways to become popular like being a Safety Patrol officer, wrestling, and performing in epic school plays. In order to truly appreciate this film, you either need to be a parent, or think from the perspective of a kid. I highly recommend DIARY OF A WIMPY KID!!!",2010
1,"Background:I am a 13 year old, which means Im in the target audience in this film. I also have seen some of the worst films ever, like ""Star Worms 2"", ""Monster A GoGo"", and ""Night of the Lepus"". When I heard hey were making a DOAWK movie, I thought it would be fun! Boy, was I wrong! This is one of the un-funniest films ever! Not sure if this is worse than Vampires Suck, but it makes Disaster Movie look like Airplane. While this film follows the books, it feels entirely different. While the books gave a funny story that 13 and 14 year old's can relate to, this film only serves to exploit middle school like 70's blaxploitation movies did to blacks.Why does every character look like a 7 year old? Ansewer: So they could get younger kids into the theater while still using the title to pander to young teens. I was offended by the way they portray middle school! ""The Cheese Touch""? Kids at my school play similar games, note that those kids are in 2nd Grade! And even they don't break friendships over that stupid game! The whole film is about the main character who""Will do anything to be famous!"" I assume that that is the only reason he took this role. This kid is so clearly without talent that I cringe at all the lines he has here! If real kids acted like that, the suicide rate int his country alone would go up by at least 60%! And there is no suspense, or drama throughout the whole movie. I don't want to give away spoilers, but lets just say nothing is resolved, clearly hoping for a sequel or 7! In conclusion, do not fall for this films tricky marketing. You will only be disappointed! One star.",2011
4,"My son likes these books and had me sit down and watch this with him. He said he liked it a lot and it was very similar to what was going on in print. Chloe Moretz and Steve Zahn round out the cast that shows the ups and downs of a boy and his best friend as they journey into middle school for the first time. Apparently there is a sequel in the works for the second book in the series due out in 2011. Needless to say my son is highly anticipating seeing that one as well. I thought it was a cute movie although more for his age group. In fact it was enjoyable and find the more stuff on his level i am watching lately i am enjoying more then the garbage that Hollywwod is putting out, how sad is that?",2010
1,"Anger, agitation, frustration can all describe the emotions during the film Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The book itself states in it's tagline ""A novel in cartoons"". Not ""A novel that will be turned into a crap, live action movie shortly."" The part where a golden ray of sunlight was shone on this movie was seeing the cartoons from the novel come to life on the screen. Though those would disappear faster than you can blink.",2010
9,"I am a fan of the book series and I was hoping this movie would be good and it was.I will say this, it's doesn't go exactly like the book. (What movie does?) There are some new scenes, new characters, and some minor characters like Chirag have bigger roles. I think all the new things kept the spirit and integrity of the book. One new scene I liked is one that assists in driving the wedge in Greg and Rowley's friendship.(Let's just say it involves dancing.) The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It was OK and brought closure, but it wasn't as good as the book ending. The acting was better than I thought it would be. Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron (Greg and Rowley) carried this film well. They both have great comedic timing and made you care about their characters. I hope there will be a sequel. ",2010
1,"I just bought the DVD of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I thought it might be a little above my 10 yr. old and 6 yr. old's interest but thought it might have some funny stuff in it. I was SO disappointed! The movie was so below the quality I thought it would have. As one post stated ""the main character is actually mean-spirited"". So watching this through the WHOLE movie was a big let down. I kept wondering when the funny, happy, stuff would happen. The only thing I got out of the movie were the scenes when some kids were mean and obnoxious...a teaching point I took advantage of. My kids would have preferred doing anything else, than to watch this movie. I, would have preferred cleaned the bathroom, than to have wasted my time and money on this. I am going to sell the DVD!",2010
1,"I agree 100% with Sean - this was a lame movie. There is nothing likable about anyone in this. Greg (the character and the boy who played him) completely lacked any charm - one-dimensional self-absorbed jerk of a character. By about halfway through the movie, I found myself liking the ""villans"" much more than Greg. The ""tender moments"" with his parents fell flat and did nothing to endear him to the audience. I wasn't expecting great cinema here; it's based on a kids' book. Didn't care for the potty humor; it was tired and immature. Even in a movie for kids, the material should try to be better. What I expected was a cute, goofy but heartwarming movie that left you smiling at the end. This is not that movie. I couldn't wait till it was over. If it weren't for my kids, who enjoyed it (but not as much as the books), I would have walked out after the first 30 minutes.",2010

1,"First and foremost, the only reason I watched this horrible movie is because it has Chloe Moretz (My favorite actress in the entire world) in it. If she wasn't in it, I would have avoided this movie completely. Basically this movie is about a whiny kid named Greg that is starting middle school, but acts like he is 4 years old. He has one best friend named Rowley, who acts like he is even younger than Greg. The whole movie is based on Greg trying to get popular at what looks like the worst school on the planet, Rowley however, doesn't worry so much about it which makes them kind of opposites. I am so offended at how school is portrayed in movies and TV shows as being such a hellhole. There were bullies at every turn, teachers that pick on students, Greg and Rowley getting into trouble for no reason at all, Middle school was nothing like that when I went. I tried to be open minded about this movie, but it really let me down. I kept waiting for it to get better. Never did! The only good parts of the movie were the ones that had Chloe Moretz in them, as for the rest of the movie, I will spend the rest of my life trying to forget it. Thank God Chloe wasn't in the sequels, she can do so much better! Do yourself a favor, stay away from this awful movie!!",2012

4,"It's always kind of awkward going into a movie you know is based on a book, but you never read the source material since it never interested you. Now there's a movie and a buzz beginning to pick up, but you still don't see the attraction. So if you're forced to see the movie and don't like it, is it because you convinced yourself you weren't going to like it going in or is it because it's just not a good movie? Well an open mind is a good thing, but sometimes things just aren't your cup of tea and you don't like a movie because it's either not good or it's aimed at an audience that you don't fit into. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is shelved somewhere between not being good and being aimed at a younger audience.",2011
4,There were only a few problems with this movie but they were major problems. The lead character is a complete (excuse the language) dickhead and deserves every bad thing that happens during the movie. Although the actor acted quite well by the end of the movie I hated Greg. He is very different than he is in the book (which is much better).,2011
1,"This film's trailer was horrible, the gags looks outdated and garbage and the characters looks lame. But i went to see it anyway, and my judgement was not far off. The films plot is something everyone has seen before with a kid getting used to middle school and the school coincidently having ""funny"" characters in it. The main character is completely unlikable and his fat friend was unfunny and just annoying. It's like the movie went out on a limb for us to hate all the people we were meant to like. The ""comedy"" sucked. Tired jokes, that fat kid doing some bad interpretation of the truffle shuffle and gags that have lame punchlines. The soundtrack did its job but wasn't the greatest. The whole film is just another lame kids film and is really for kids or people with IQ's less than 90/parents who think these kinds of films are funny.",2010

The best ones cause us to examine our own thoughts while analyzing the actions of others we probably don't quite understand.

If a screenwriter and director can't even tell their story competently within the confines of the genre they first set up, their movie will fail. ",2010
4,"I have never heard of this movie until it came to my local theater. With a A-list star line up such as DeNiro, Norton and Jovovich how could this movie miss. I was wrong. It did. Those who appreciate great acting in a movie won't be disappointed. (Did you ever see a movie Edward Norton was in that he wasn't absolutely great..well, maybe a couple that he may have did for the just the money..lol. His absolute best was ""American History X"") The movie itself moved along a pace that one keeps looking at his/her watch waiting for the ending. And the ending, again, is the latest Hollywood type...it sucks. Storyline was interesting but never got you interested to a point where one found it entertaining. This was a 98% dialog movie. You could be listening to this entire movie and never watch the video portion and understand the entire script. I am a big fan of Norton and Jovovich but this movie I could have passed on.",2010
10,When reading the ratings and reviews of this film I believe that some viewers went in expecting something different. I can fully understand that it wasn't for everyone. The film surprised me as to how non typical it was in its plotting but it was the best character study in a long time.,2011
8,I went to see Stone earlier today for an advance screening as Ed Norton is promoting the film at my school next week. Honestly I had absolutely no idea what this film was about going in. The marketing just flew over my head I suppose. I just knew who was acting in it.,2010

6,"Deniro and Norton, back together again. Stone's first two acts are great. You're intrigued, it's unpredictable, and interesting. But the third act leaves you confused and almost unaffected by the story at the end. Stone (norton) is up for parole and wants to get out. Why not throw his sex-crazed wife (jocovich) in front of Jack's (Deniro) feet. But one of these three is starting to see life under a new life. How will this play out? Norton was great but nothing spectacular. Will remind you of his primal fear days.

10,"The plot of the film is not very interesting. It could easily be the most boring film in the world, but it isn't. De Niro, Norton, Jovovich, one of the best actors in the world made watching this film experience of the first class. De Niro plays a guy at the end of his active life, weeks or months before the retirement. This is the time where he will realize that his whole life was a lie, told million of times, learned at school, thought at the church. Lie that says work hard, be men, don't have feelings. Jack (De Niro) is a stone in this film, until he meets Stone (Norton). Norton's character seems the easiest, a guy who wants to get out of a prison. His change seems also shallow, change initiated by wanting to get out. But by the end of the film he's growing up. In last acts where his parole is secured he is taking responsibility for his actions that got him to prison. With no regret but with understanding. He is the winner in this film. Mila. I think it was my first time seeing Mila in a non zombie film, and I want to say magnificent, her play was magnificent. In the film, she is sweet, she is cute, she is extremely sexy, she is happy, she is seductive, she is intelligent, she is dangerous (when she comes to Jack's house) and she's depressed (at the very end). Lucetta (the character she played) is a very complicated women, but also full of energy. Mysterious too. She can do anything for her husband Stone, but is she doing this for him or for herself? This is a question that hasn't been answer in the film. The viewer will have to live with that. great film.",2010
5,"This film has: an extremely convincing performance of nearly all of the main actors. Particularly noteworthy is Bob de Niro ""comeback"" after all the despicable ""lati-grobman""-produced mediocre disappointing films, he finally managed to give a performance of his Golden Years. Lee Strasberg could have been proud of him here. De Niro's acting in this feature can be put in line with all his major dramatic achievements (Deer Hunter, etc). The main problem with this film is what I call the ""no-story-thing"". The script is so weak as if non existent. I'd like to pose the obvious questions: *Who* the de Niro's character is? What was the historic psychological dramatic crime he had committed in his younger years that made his wife wanting the separation? I am 100% sure that de Niros' character is in no way ""accomplished"" in the film. It is simply too inconsistent and unconvincingly odd. The same goes for Mila Jovovich character. Mila delivered here one of the best dramatic performances in her entire cinematic career, that is true. But Mila's character is also remarkably unclear, it is far too contradictory and inconsistent as well. We do not understand *why* she behaves the way she does, we do not understand what she feels about her troubled husband. If she is a psycho-prostitute or a cheap call-girl, that should have been stated more clearly. The film lacks any message, any consistent line or a well-elaborated ""story"". The script seems to be too poorly orchestrated. There are too many unexplained details that are altogether ""too odd to be missed"" and at the same time clearly do not indicate anything meaningful. Like, why the wife of de Niro's character must have ""different-sized"" eyes; does this ""eye disease"" connote something particular, or is just another accidental sloppy ""oddness""? The film leads its viewer nowhere, the director has no message to tell to his viewers, and the way the movie ends only strengthens the feeling that the scriptwriter and the director simply did not know what to do with it, the ending is a CLEAR regrettable fiasco.",2011

DeNiro & Norton turn in good performances as does Jovovich, to a degree, but there is damned little story to keep the interest up. The script seemed as if the screenwriter was making it up even as the cameras rolled. The pacing was glacial. The cinematography was more of TV movie of the week quality than a theatrical production. Too many unexplained aspects to the story culminating in a finale which has you wondering just why you sat through the whole thing for this. I would suggest passing on this one and renting a copy of The Score for some quality DeNiro/Norton action.",2011

It is absolutely about nothing,there's no plot whatsoever, Edward Norton plays an annoying and not very believable character, Robert de Niro a depressing and depressed old man, and Milla just flashes her tits and that's it. It's a 2 hour torture to sit down and watch this movie. It is sooo slow that you just can't help but drift off.

This movie did to me what nothing else does in our society anymore and that is bringing up the question of our existence, right or wrong, God etc. And the best part is it is not trying to answer those questions but is revealing the lack of understanding of what life is in life. What seemed to look like another mediocre movie about prison and cons, come up as a great surprise of a movie.

The stars in this film gave top-notch performances, but either the writing or the editing (or both) was sadly lacking. There has to be some kind of payoff by the end of a film or there is no reason to watch it in the first place. Even Documentaries draw conclusions by the end of the story-telling.

6,"The musical numbers reminded me of ""Sweet Charity"" and the camera moves around the Kit Kat Klub style room like Fosse's camera did in ""Cabaret"" The similarities stop there. The film is a brave attempt but the writing walks a very, very thin line. Was Steve Antin trying to be funny? Some of the lines were received with loud guffaws and there is no way to know if that was the intention because, personally, I felt like cringing. Never mind. It was fun. Christina has a powerful voice but not film presence and Cher is a fearless icon but she had so little to show for it. The best performance is, without question, by Stanley Tucci. The songs work at the moment you're watching them being performed but I couldn't hum a tune now, 48 hours later, for the life of me. So, I was entertained and in the big scheme of things, I guess that's enough",2010

I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.",2010
8,"I can easily summarize this film into short sentences. This film has everything, everything but a plot that is. What you should expect from Burlesque is almost two hours of high powered entertainment. Burlesque is just that, entertaining. If you are going to this film to witness a great storyline unfold don't go see this film. However, if you want to be entertained with great vocals from Christina Aguilera and Cher in addition to great acting from Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci, Alan Cummings, and again Cher then this film is a must see. I must say prior to the screening that I attended, I was very apprehensive that I was going to see a product that resembled a ""Nine"" / ""Coyote Ugly"" blend of a film, but I was certainly wrong. Burlesque holds itself above the rest of the films in its category. The film obviously cost a lot to produce and I believe that the money was well spent. Cher's performance was excellent. Say what you want about the person, but the actress conveys a confidence level in front of the camera as though she has done this a hundred times. Stanley Tucci is also quite merit worthy in this film. His performance in ""Lovely Bones"" is still haunting and his role as Cher's right-hand gay best friend/costume designer in this film just shows what incredible range this actor has. The costume design, casting, choreography and set design for this film are also worthy of mention. You can count on this film definitely being nominated in the Best Film in Comedy or Musical category for the Golden Globes in December. This film will also do incredibly well at the box office. I would have no problem watching this film again.",2010

This movie shows how it can be done-with someone of the awesome power of Christine and a showcase for veteran CHER, these ladies blow away the plot absurdity and the male cheesecake to rock out. If only Chicago had the dance and song power of these pieces, it would have been as great as everyone said it was. And if only some of the other great women songsters sitting at home were given this kind of raw musical showcase. This movie shows that as far as great vocalization. women hold there own and then some. Christine-you are a star. So there it is, some power music pieces, thrilling vocal fireworks, and a reworking of the R and B ""lady on fire"" legacy that goes back to the first blues shouters, moves through greats like Aretha and Sharon Jones, and becomes oh so real in this bit of very musical celluloid. Unlike Thanksgiving dinner, this warm meal left you wanting more. Much more.",2010
3,"The state of American film in the 21st Century has been generally abysmal but nowhere is it more evident than in the film musical. Taking the most honored of the period Chicago, a Fosse wanta be with bad performances and forgettable tunes as the benchmark it is more than evident all singing all dancing has lost its voice and more than a step. The latest entry and every bit the tepid much ado about nothing heat and light display of flaccid musical storytelling as the Oscar winner (an even bigger comment on the unimaginative state of the movie business) is the insipidly slick Burlesque.",2010
10,I love this movie . I think Christina aguria did a amazing job playing ali . I love all the music in it there fun enjoyable songs to listen to . i ask my mom to buy me the sound track for Christmas because i could listen to the the songs all day and not get bord . but any ways i was blow away when i saw this movie it was so inspiring and i love the story to it . but my favorite part of the movie is when Tess sing you haven't seen the last of me when she was on the stage you can just feel her emotion through the song it really powerful and up lifting song i love love it . it the best musical i saw so far with the best music . i hope you all enjoy what i wrote .,2011
7,"Raise the curtain! Before heading to watch thiz movie, I already had my own imagination about how the story would look like, I thought maybe it revolved around a countryside girl who was about to try her luck to chase her dream in a big city (eventually the city is Los Angeles and the girl's name is Ali which is played by Christina Aguilera), maybe she would start from a cloistered but extraordinary nite club (apparently it named Burlesque), maybe she would have a tough beginning for her career and there would be such a mentor for her (I talk about Cher), maybe she was going to meet her love interest, a pretty boy with an attitude (I talk about Cam Gigandet), or maybe she would be forced to quarrel with her envious evil colleague as well (I talk about Kristen Bell). And for the ending I don't have to explain, I give it to you to figure it out yourself, I am pretty sure that you have already know the ending as well, and you are right! In the tradition of ""Coyote Ugly"" (2000) and Rob Marshall's movies such as ""Chicago"" (2002) and ""Nine"" (2009), here it comes a new breed of the genre. The movie is second directing effort after ""Glass House: The Good Mother"" (2006) by former child star of ""The Goonies"" (1985), Steve Antin. Thiz Ali's character is obviously made for Aguilera, it's like let a fish swims freely into the sea. It flows naturally. Cher is a legendary music icon who makes one dimensional impression, there is no specific chemistry with other Cast members, she seems to be talking to herself. Cam Gigandet, after seeing his macho performance previously in ""Never Back Down"" (2008), thiz time he plays more easy-going and fun role. But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance, it's not convincing at all as Ali's competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Actors, the film once again is an Aguilera's playground. Her powerful voice covers up all the flaws. The opening song ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" is my favorite with gratifying 1970s Rock 'n' Roll tune. With all those fabulous songs, it comes to my mind why there isn't one single duet song from these two world class performers. Anyway, the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera's performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. In fact, who doesn't want to pay small nite club's cheap ticket that there is a performance from Christina Aguilera. Hello? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is cliché. It doesn't look like a movie after all. By the way, I didn't come home from a movie. I had just come home from Christina Aguilera's concert. And I am happy! ^_^ ",2011
4,"Like the name implies, ""Burlesque"" was lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious. Unlike the name, I think it was too serious to be much of a parody of stage-shows. Cher is an actress, an Academy Award winning actress at that, but there was minimal evidence of intentional self-caricaturing.",2011
10,This movie was beyond anything i could have ever expected. Christina really pulled it off and Cher she was amazing as always. Saw it today and I went out and bought the sound track. The music is great! This is a movie i will buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray. Hurray! The story is very simple and that is a good thing. The writer did not over do it with drama and was able to focus on the characters and the music. I was so surprised when I saw that Christina can not only sing and dance her pants off but she can actually act. The best part of this movie is the music. This is my new favorite movie. I went into the movie after getting up on Black Friday at 5am and i exited the theater in a great mood and with tons of energy.,2010
8,"Just watched this ambitious Cher-Christina Aguilera musical drama with my theatre-working friend and we both found it fabulous! Is it a masterpiece? Well, not quite as the plot seems to be quite derivative not to mention a romance subplot involving Ms. Aguilera's possible ""gets"" between her-roommate-with-a-fiancée-far-away (Cam Gigandet) and an-older-rich-man-who's-trying-to-buy-Cher's-club (Eric Dane). But the leading performances of both are fine which also goes for the supporting turns by some of the above not to mention Kristen Bell and especially Stanley Tucci as the right hand man of Cher's at the club. And seeing both Ms. Aguilera and Cher singing their songs-especially the latter on ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me""-are at their most compelling. There's also the requisite witty lines that make things go more smoothly as the narrative goes on. Oh, and more thing: I didn't recognize neither Julianne Hough nor Dianna Agron when they appeared on screen so I was surprised when I read who they were in the ending credits. But, overall, Burlesque was a rollicking good time for my friend and me.",2010
6,"If you like old fashioned musicals this is for you. Small town girl comes to Hollywood. In the tradition of ""Cabaret"" the music is performed in the venue rather then the characters bursting into song like dialogue. Unlike ""Cabaret"" the bad guys aren't Nazis, but unseen evil banks and real estate developers.",2010
8,"This movie is exactly what you'd expect, and doesn't try to be much more. It's all about the music, and the main ""plot"" of the movie almost seems tacked-on, as if the studio realized it couldn't just release a 100-minute film of Christina belting out burlesque tunes. So they threw a story together to pad out the moments between musical numbers.",2010
10,"It has been awhile since I have seen a GREAT musical and this is it! It was a long time coming, but this is a great movie. Yes! Cher still has the gift of song and did a great job. This movie is such a part of Cher's career and where she is today...her solo was excellent. The other actors all played their parts to a Tee! Worked well together and it seemed very believable on a story level. Haven't said this often, but will probably go see this movie again..just to hear the music. I will more than likely buy the CD...it is that good. This movie should get an Oscar for best musical...fun evening and can't go wait to see it again....enjoy!",2010
4,"According to the dictionary, the word ""burlesque"" is defined as being a variety show characterized by low-comedy and striptease.",2014
8,Well I wont be as long winded as some ... cough cough... however I have not been a fan of either.. and just figured this was another Chicago.. not really into musicals.. easy to figure out..,2011
7,"BURLESQUE sets itself up for some fairly blunt 2011 criticism for it's lame storyline but if one knows their films of the 30s to the 70s, you can see they type of nightclub musical it wants to be. If BURLESUE was made in the 30s it would be a Warner bros Vitaphone musical like 42nd STREET or FOOTLIGHT PARADE. Christina Aguelira would be played by Joan Blondell who she actually resembles. Cam Gigandet would be James Cagney. Cher vs Mae West. Hop into the 40s and we might have Rita Hayworth as Cher, Berry Grable as Christina, and called COVER GIRL or PIN UP GIRL, or if you prefer staying in a cheaper locale THE SWING PARADE OF 1946, Monogram's big nightclub musical mess starring Gale Storm and performers in a finale who did not appear anywhere else in the whole film. In the 50s, well just have a look at either PAL JOEY or THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. The opening 5 minutes of BURLESQUE resembles the 1965 Elvis credit sequence on a bus in TICKLE ME. BURLESQUE really really wants to be all of the fabulous nightclub scenes from SWEET CHARITY... the scenes where Charity meets Vittorio and sees the RICH MAN'S FRUG dance numbers with awesome Barrie Chase and her 10' legs and whopper hair. Now that we are in Fossey territory, add some CABARET (in fact, a lot of CABARET), mix in MOULIN ROUGE and plenty of CHICAGO and Columbia's B grade subsidiary Screen Gems give us a new B grade nightclub musical with all the above elements called BURLESQUE. This film just wants to be some of all those above. Hell it is far better than NINE and miles ahead of RENT, which for me is just fine. I actually think the 'lets save the nightclub' storyline is a wink to other cliché musicals and knows it. (Boogaloo, anyone?) What is good about BURLESQUE is the hilarious script which has some terrific lines, the excellent rapport between the three leads Cher, C.A and Stanley Tucci... and of course cute Cam as the Paul Newman type love interest. His 'box of cookies' nude scene adds some well timed zing. The dance numbers are thoroughly enjoyable albeit badly edited and filmed too close, like most of the film. The songs good and the costumes offer the old razzle dazzle as well they could and actually do. BURLESQUE knows it is silly and has a great time with it... hey just like an actual BURLESQUE show. Just enjoy. it's not difficult. BURLESQUE might even get Barbra Striesand out of the house to make a new musical given she would see it as her husband James Brolin has a cameo and Cher is her same age: 66. Also finally Cher might get the cash to make the Mae West musical for which she is now ideal. BURLESQUE would make a terrific double feature with Columbia's own 1948 cheapie LADIES OF THE CHORUS starring Marilyn Monroe in the Christina part.",2011
4,"Christina Aguilera is the second singer to make her big screen debut this month. The first being Pixie Lott with her futile effort as Judy in a contender for the worst film of the year, Fred: The Movie. As we saw in Fred, Pixie occasionally sang in some parts of the film to demonstrate the talent and Aguilera does the same but only a lot more considering Burlesque is a musical. So is this the same case scenario as Fred? Better, but certainly nothing great.",2010
9,"""Burlesque"" is probably the most compelling contemporary movie musical that I have ever seen; the score, acting, costumes, and cinematography were executed, impeccably.",2010
9,"Cher is great in this movie. She should be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. And the movie itself is wonderful. It's far-fetched, brassy, silly, wonderful. The musical numbers are incredible. Christine Aguilera is charming and wow, can she sing! Even the bad guy is wonderful. This is the type of movie that makes you feel like you don't want it to end. It offers nonstop music, melodramatics, silly scenes, and laughs. Stanley Tucci is great as Cher's assistant, friend, and confidante. Burlesque is larger than life, it's pure escapism. The musical numbers fill the screen, the music is loud, snappy and upbeat. The movie has no lulls, is entertaining, has a simple storyline and likable characters. If anyone thinks that Cher is over the hill, watch this movie and think again, And if anyone thinks that Ms. Aguilera is not star material, watch this movie and think again. This movie is proof that the Hollywood musical is still alive and kicking.",2010
3,"I rated this show a 1 because of what the kids who watched it with me said. The kids ranging from 4 - 10 - which is probably the demographic this is aimed at because the plots are pretty thin - complained about the following: 1) Terrible acting, and they didn't like either of the girls either.",2010
2,"Yea this show is just... really... bad. The cast is just plain awful. David Cleveland although he might just be an amateur is just intolerably annoying. And baaaaaad... I've met and babysat a lot of kids and I don't think any kid would act like that, which may be for comedic purposes... it's not... there's like no passion to his acting, it's like watching a elementary school play. Actually the whole show feels like that. In fact the only thing saving this review from a 1/10 is Bella Thorne who actually isn't that bad. Or maybe she's lucky she's really cute. Either way I actually liked that kid's performance and was the only reason I didn't hit that channel button. Her friend however... really irritating. Sorry to say. Of course this just judging from two episodes and frankly... I don't think I want to see anymore...",2010
1,I'll start with something positive. The show does have some catchy songs and fun dance sequences. That's about all I can think of.,2011
1,"This show is awful. The characters are such show-offs, they try to act ""cool,"" and way older than 13. The little brother, Flynn, could not be more annoying. Cece is just... awful. Bella Thorne is adorable, I'll give her that, but the character is such a show-off, always calling herself the ""best dancer ever,"" bragging about her spot on a dance show, and bragging about her debit-card and allll the things she just bought with it. Rocky is pretty much the same. She's not a good actress, and she's very obnoxious. The other two kids, Deuce and Ty, SO. ANNOYING. They're so cocky, and Deuce has a horrid name, its pretty darn easy to slip up and say something else...",2011
3,"I watch this show with my little sisters, but it's the worse show Disney has produced yet. I like Wizards of Waverly places, but this show is just BAD in general. The jokes aren't funny, the story line is a bore, it consists of bad overacting and terrible dancing. The girls dance incredibly sloppily and the only character who can really dance is Roshon Fegan. During each episode, I feel like what they define as ""acting"" are just their lines said screaming. The only positive things I have to say about this show is that I like the theme song, the boys are cute, and the two main characters are gorgeous; that's probably the only reason Disney picked them in the first place--after all, they can't dance, and they definitely can't act.",2011
1,"This Show is absolutely terrible...I'm a 12 year old saying this! Disney have officially ran out of ideas..the new show ""good luck Charlie"" was very good but this shake it up show is terrible and the main characters are so annoying!! i don't think it would be funny to even a 6 year old!! I hate this show and I bet there are many who agree with me!!! The thing that the show is about seems alright but the actresses act so bad It ruins the whole thing..no wonder they only have each other..i wouldn't like them ever!! This show won't go far. Even Hannah Montana is better than this rubbish and that is shocking so I wonder how the next idea of Disney's will end up like.",2011
1,"Oh my word! Who's idea was this? This is the worst show Disney has ever had. The plot is dumb, the acting is terrible, and it's not funny at all. I'm sure so many people (including me) would love to be up there on TV, people with talent. Disney hit an all time low with this cast. They have no talent for acting whatsoever. Seriously, who picked these people? The plot is dumb because the most common people get picked for a spot on a dance show as background dancers. But they sure are in the front a lot for a couple of background dancers. And there these two German characters who make you want to start a war with Germany. There's this stupid red head twig, Cece, who has dyslexia. She gives it a bad name. She has bad grades and does a terrible job of acting stupid. It's so stereotypical. She makes it look like all people with dyslexia are lazy and stupid and they use their disability as an excuse. Her character is supposedly ""wild and free"", but she just looks like a moron to me. But then there's her best friend, Rocky. She's annoying and intrusive. And there's this guy Deuce. He's also not very bright. And he's also a ""business man"" if that's what they dare to call it. And then there's Rocky's older brother, Ty, who is equally annoying. He's a ""playa"" who wants to be a rapper. And then there's Cece's little brother. This child is rude and loud. My 7 year old little sister even hates this show. She's a kid who likes pretty much everything. Well, not everything I guess. I just didn't like this show and I thought it was dumb.",2011
1,"Ah shake it up, the worst show in history!!!!!!!! When i was searching through TV channels and nothing was on so i decided to put on shake it up because i had no choice. So when I just watch 30 seconds of the show, I was bored. The jokes are not even funny. The acting is so horrible that I would through up multiple times and that shows how bad the show is. This is not the magic of Disney. Today we get shows that have to do with real people. I remember as a little kid, the original mickey mouse cartoons were on so I would watch that( please note that I am 14 and the cartoons were re-runs). I wish Disney today would just go back to the basics and make more mickey mouse cartoons and i'm not talking about mickey mouse clubhouse which just ruined mickey mouse. So final verdict: shake it up is just a waste of time and is just stupid. And watch the show is going to get cancelled in a matter of episodes.",2011
3,"Shake It Up! is Disney's newest show about two 13-year-old girls living in Chicago. The show is centered around the teens' new ""jobs"" on a hit television show called Shake It Up Chicago where the latest dance crazes are broadcasted. Plots of the episodes mostly include scenes from the show, school and some of the girls other antics. Not only are the plots hollow and problems resolved way too easily, but the girls are also far too independent for 7th/8th graders. There are almost no adults in the entire show (CeCe's mom works late nights as a cop, Rocky's mom has only been in one episode, and other teachers or authority figures are almost never shown). If any teenage girl actually lived like this, especially with how gorgeous Bella and Zendaya (stars of the show) are, they probably would have been kidnapped by now. Not only are the plots, characters, problems and resolutions ridiculous, but so is their dancing. The only good dancer on the show is the part of Rocky's brother Ty played by Roshan. In my opinion Shake It Up cannot be considered a ""dance show"", due to the fact that they ONLY display freestyle/fad dancing, aka the latest crazes in music videos. They pay absolutely no respects to any other form of dancing such as ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, modern, hip hop, street, acrobatics etc. I have been a dancer for 13 years and I have never seen something so ridiculous as to call itself a dance show. In all, this show may be amusing to 5-7 year olds, but anyone older than that, grab the remote as fast as you possibly can.",2011
1,"After hearing some friends say the show was good I decided to give it a chance even though I normally don't like these kinds of shows. I don't like Sonny with a chance and most Disney shows with ""Teen"" Singers/Dancers/Actors. But I thought I might like this one. I have no idea why and I was so wrong! This is probably one of THE worst Disney shows in years-if not the worst! Hannah Montana was OK and Suite Life was OK. This show is the worst of them all! Its the opposite messages you want to send to kids. First of all, in the beginning episode you see the two main characters, CeCe and Rocky, dancing for money on the streets. Not for food but for a cell phone! Next they go on a dancing show to fulfill their dream (nothing wrong with that , right?). Well, CeCe and Rocky come 2nd at some of the competitions. Instead of saying ""We'll try harder next time"" they whine and whine. Not a good message to send to kids! Next is the wardrobe. I noticed that the 2 main girls wear clothes and makeup that would take hours to put together. It looks unreal how they would look so ""Professionally done"" at school! Next is the writing. The writers just re-use the same lines on every show! And the same character personalities. Every show now on Disney there is a mean, popular girl, usually 2 girls who get picked on by the mean girl, the annoying brother and the goofy kid. Almost all those characters are on Hannah Montana. The one good show on Disney I like is Good Luck Charlie. Its good, funny and has normal kids. No kids trying to be famous. Go watch Good Luck Charlie!",2011
1,"Shake it Up is, in essence, a cheap attempt by Disney to attract the singers and dancers who made up the ""High School Musical"" fan base. But this is just poor. The plot was probably thought up while the creator was on a drunken rant and the actresses hired based on their appeal to preteens instead of true acting ability. The show, like every Disney show, has the two female friends, their male companions, the ignorant black man who serves as a ""clown"" of sorts. This show couldn't be any worst. The jokes aren't funny,not even to my younger sister. The characters are unappealing, the show is extremely overacted and the whole thing has a production value that should PAY you to watch it. This just showcases, once again, Disney cannot rent a good show. Even when ABC or Disney gets a good show, they get rid of it for poor shows like this. I would rejoice if it were canceled.",2011
1,"Okay, let me begin by saying in a nut shell: this show a disgrace to Disney Channel. Now to elaborate on that nut shell statement, let me just begin with the characters, awful, just awful. Rocky=smart-a**and arrogant beyond recognition. I will say her dancing is not bad, but seriously, every time she laughs it just sounds more fake and fake (don't even know how that is possible). She has an awful ego and many other reasons (I want to keep this review as short as possible), then there's CeCe= such a valley girl, I don't even know. Now my main complaint against her is she makes dyslexics look bad all over the place. Trust me, I've gone to a school for gifted and dyslexic people, and there were super smart people. Anyways, she complains in the beginning of the series about Rocky knowing about her dyslexia, however she is beyond a failure at school and gives a bad impression for dyslexics. It's her own fault she doesn't study and ultimately fails, and still has the audacity to complain. Next character: Flynn. Good grief have mercy on this kid. He is ANNOYING and has the undeserved ego that equals to that of Lexi from ANT Farm or Zuri from Jessie. I'd prefer Matt from Lizzie McGuire because he was tolerable and funny at times, however, Flynn just makes me so angry every time he talks, it's like I lose brain cells. He thinks he's cute (honestly not really), and almost always has a sarcastic remark for what anyone says. The other two characters, Deuce and Ty, are such wannabes. That's all I have to say.",2013
1,"I do love Disney, having grown up with it. Not all the Disney Channel show stuff is bad, I love Good Luck Charlie, Sonny with a Chance and Phineas and Ferb(and also Even Stevens when it was on). On the other hand, there are also some stuff on there I cannot stand, especially this and Hannah Montana.",2011
2,"Shake It Up is about 2 girls aspiring to be on their favourite dance show, & of course they do end up on the show. Afterwards, the show is about how its like to be on Shake it Up Chicago & the struggles with all the characters. Well, At first I thought the show was funny & that was only because of Gunther but afterwards I realized the show was terrible! First of all, these girls Cece & Rocky are supposed to be really good dancers but honestly I don't think they are even that talented! Cece's brother Flynn is an absolute headache & cannot act AT ALL. Any thing he does seemed so fake. I thought that Ty & Deuce were kind of useless as characters & were an excuse for a laugh. Gunther & Tinka, are probably the most funny part of the show or the only reason its watchable. Cece & Flynn's mom really didn't do much for the show either & I think she was as useless as Deuce & Ty. Ty, Deuce, & the Mom were basically just added in there as excuses for characters. I think that in this show, Disney tried too hard to get creative with names because I have never seen anyone or heard of anyone named Deuce. Doesn't the word Deuce have something to do with Tennis? The music, the fashion, & maybe Gunther & Tinka are the only reasons I think anyone would continue to watch this show.",2011
1,"I think that Disney channel hit its high point when it created Hannah Montana and wizards of Waverly place. however, it went downhill when it created sonny with a chance and then even further when it created good luck Charlie. when i first saw shake it up i knew it was going to be bad. the two main characters CeCe and Rocky get discovered dancing and get put on a TV show. It is exactly like how Sonny got discovered and put on the show So Random. The dancing in the show is very bad and the characters acting is terrible. They OVER act using too many facial expressions and hand gestures. The only thing i somewhat enjoyed were the two Russian characters who were kind of funny. After a few minutes of watching the show, my head started to hurt and i had to turn the channel to something else. Disney Channel needs to come up with better ideas.",2011
1,"There are no words to express how much I hate this show! Let me start with the atrocious actors: Zendaya, or whatever her name is, cannot act to save her life!!! OMG all of her facial expressions make me want to punch her in the throat. She can't dance, can't act, or SING. Goodness did they just find her off the street???? ZERO TALENT WHATSOEVER! Bella Thorne, is not as bad as Zendaya when it comes to acting, but SUCKS at dancing! Good lord in the first episode at the ending dance scene you can see her COUNTING! She also has ZERO TALENT. Davis Cleveland has got to be the WORST ACTOR TO EVER GRACE THE Disney NAME! Are you effin kidding me??? He's got the acting skills of an ametuear elementary school play! He is so freaking annoying and they need to write him off the show. The annoying siblings who also think they have talent: Annoying, but not as bad as everyone else. They too, HORRIFIC at dancing. Older brother: Has got to be the best person on the show! He's got the best acting skills, which is not saying much but still! He is freaking AMAZING at dancing and can do SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS! Deuce(The guy whose face looks like its painted on): I don't really pay attention too sooo IDK? But judging from the rest of the cast he can't be too good.",2011
1,"this show is unfunny , stupid , too cocky and just plain annoying whats so entertaining about 1 smoking hot chick and one ugly chick dancing and being b***** to each other. I'm so annoyed by this show and I'm so angry that people even like it.suite life on deck , sonny with a chance , my baby sitters a vampire , so random and good luck Charlie are funny this is not this is retarded just like the hot girl in shake it up.",2012
1,"I watched 3 episodes since i wanted to see how it was. Before i watched it i knew it would be bad and i was right. It has bad acting, bad dancing, jokes that aren't funny, weird clothes and too much make up. Is this what Disney wants to show kids cause if so this generation is ruined. Did i also mention that the jokes were already used before in other shows which is why its not really funny. If you want to watch something good or have kids watch something good i would suggest older Disney shows since they have meaning and are actually enjoyable. I may only be 15 but i have seen so many old Disney shows that were great and seeing this just makes me upset. Its as if Disney channel is creating bad shows in order to gain attention of young girls and more money. If only Disney channel was how it was before because now i can no longer watch it without this and other shows coming on that aren't even good.",2011
1,"What in the hell is this?! The first episode was a slap in my face, I just knew this wasn't going to continue well. First off we have a stupid red head who probably knows nothing but Dance an that's the worst part....she CAN'T dance!! Then we have this know it all smartas* who can't dance either and thinks she's best at everything, which she's clearly not. Then we have lame as* Tinka who looks like my uncle gold tooth every episode. This show is by far the worst Disney could think of! Who ever thought this show was a good idea, probably never had a childhood experience with Disney and their entertaining shows in the past. The only time I smiled and enjoyed the show was when the credits were on the screen going to good luck Charlie. I feel bad for Selena Golmez she had to sit there and record there shi*y theme song.",2013
1,"Firstly I'm 13 and I have two sisters, 6 and 11, and we all hate Shake It Up. Here are the many reasons why. Most of the characters are incredibly annoying especially Davis Cleveland, who, as well, acts like he's in a school play. He's very painful to watch and me and my sisters dislike him very much. The story lines are also very bad and aren't funny and so are the jokes. I could make better jokes then the writers. Bella Thorne and Zendaya over act about every line in the script and are very irritating. To conclude my overall view of Shake It Up is very dim and very hard to watch. I give it a 1 because the ratings don't go any lower. Disney really needs to put they're thinking caps on and think of some...descent programmes. However I do enjoy Good Luck Charlie.",2012
4,"From the previews I knew this movie wasn't going to do justice to the original. I mean, can anything? I wasn't planning on watching it, but my best friend wanted to see it and I gave in. Bad idea. It was a waste of my money. ",2010
2,"OK so I'll give the movie some credit for trying to be a coming of age type story. If you can sit through the first half hour plus of Jaden Smith being a complete brat to everyone (especially his mother who just lays down and takes it), then maybe you get to Jackie Chan's short (and only) real fight scene, and Jaden learning some Kung Fu.",2010
1,"I thought it was horrible. I will never watch this movie again. I think that it is a blasphemous insult to the original, which really should be watched again. There are notable life-lessons in the original, and they are paraphrased in the remake. The quote of ""wax on, wax off"" had meaning, and became embedded into pop-culture. As did the crane stance. This movie can be easily forgotten. Daniel learning the basic forms for blocking by washing cars, painting fences and sanding the floor makes a LOT more sense than Dre learning anything by taking his jacket off and picking it up off the floor any number of times. A constant repetitive motion done for hours is a lot more relevant than the infinite variations of the way one puts on and takes off a jacket.",2011

4,"I will be the first to admit that I am a major fan of the the first Karate Kid and not a fan of Jaden Smith. However, I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed in Jaden and walked away disappointed in 3 totally different things. After watching this film, I am convinced that Will Smith bought off the critics and those that voted this highly or said this was better than the original were 1 of 3 things 1) A plant of the studio or close friends. 2) under the influence, or 3) too busy getting physically pleasured to really focus. This film had 3 major flaws and Jadens acting ability or lack thereof was the least of this films worries and truthfully, though I don't think Jaden can act his way out of a paper bag, his performance didn't help or hurt the film, I think he was the same as he was in the others. with that said, I will say that his martial arts skills were good and it's obvious that he put in a lot of work and effort into learning the form. I'll give credit where credit is due and for that reason I give this a 4. However, this film lacks the 3 C's. Cohesion, Chemistry and Character development. Lets start with Cohesion.",2010
1,"This film is a perfect example of how difficult it is to actually make a good film. Even using a proved script and story that led to a monumental film in 1984 couldn't save this reboot. It is simply awful in every way. Poor acting, poor cinematography, poor directing, poor editing, poor poor poor. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent. In the original, Daniel spends half the film working on Mr. Miyagi's house. He is forced to do the work because he made the promise of ""i karate teach and you karate learn"". In this film, Dre hangs up a jacket ""a thousand times"" and then knows kung fu. They had the opportunity to really cross the generational gap by coming up with some original takes on ""paint the fence"", ""wax the car"", ""sand the floor"". I remember as a kid spending hours joking around with friends mimicking these motions. Now kids just get to hang up their jacket? I'm sure their parents love that their kids hang up jackets now but they are just missing out. I'm surprised they didn't do ""make your bed"", ""brush your teeth"", ""clean the dishes"". If they are going to follow the original script then either fully commit or don't commit at all. This movie couldn't figure out if it was making fun of the original, redoing the original, or just going through some motions. What's shocking is how successful this movie was. It is obviously because of the terrific story and a whole new generation of kids watching this tale unfold for the first time. And i'm sure parents loved taking their kids to go see it because they can share something that meant so much to them 25 years ago. Let me save everyone from sitting through this mess and suggest that you can experience this story with your kids by watching the original. Even today, the original stands up much better than this disaster. this is easily my worst attempt at a review on IMDb and that's exactly what this film deserved. Long Live Daniel San.",2011
1,"Look, first of all, I grew up with the original, not the cheap copy. Second, just because you have a kid doesn't mean he can act or should be in movies. I saw the interview where Will said he read for the part and the director loved him, and unless the director has no brain, that just can't be true. Jaden is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, anywhere. Seriously. He sucked in the other movies his father put him in also. Will is a good actor, but it's obviously not hereditary. As for the movie, the plot's just all sorts of stupid. ""Jacket off?"" Sounds like some cheesy porn line. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb movie. Go watch anything else but this.",2012
8,"This movie, more so than any film this year, has had the most ""noise"" generated. Mostly from people ignorant of the film and just exactly how good or bad it is. The discussion has been centered on why call it ""The Karate Kid"" if he is learning Kung Fu. It is easy; the name is recognition and ""Kung Fu Kid"" sounds like a ripoff, not a remake and this is a remake and they are not hiding the fact. Enough said, explanation done, go back to your bowl of cereal.",2010
1,"Clumsy exposition that is trying to be subtle, but ends up being super direct, in that intellectually insulting way. From the beginning to the end, this movie really talks down to its audience, even if the demographic aimed at is children. I found myself laughing at serious scenes which were not only bizarre but ridiculously overreaching. I really hate it when stories explain directly what is painfully obvious, or try to insert it, in unrealistic and absurd ways.",2010
2,"After renting the movie, I was definitely not impressed with the script, nor with the acting. Being a fan of the original that came out when i was a kid, I'm a little biased but looking at it apart from the original series, it still REALLY SUCKED. Of course, one of the biggest fouls is they're labeling it the ""Karate"" Kid, the Japanese martial art, when in the movie Jaden Smith's character learns Kung Fu, the Chinese martial art. Even for franchising purposes, it's still pretty stupid. For me, the movie painted several very unrealistic scenarios. The biggest one was the casting of Taraji P. Henson to play the role of Sherry. The whole movie, she presents her character as a complete idiot who knows almost nothing about the world or her son and has somehow miraculously survived layoffs & firings to be transferred to the same job in Beijing. She portrays her character so poorly it makes the plot extremely unbelievable in that no one would ever move someone this dumb to what would presumably be a somewhat important position, or any position for that matter, half way across the world. Somehow they must be short of workers in China and need ours for some reason or another. Another unrealistic scenario was the portrayal of the Chinese students portraying than a group of Americanized thugs completely removed from their parents & their culture. I've been many places in the world but there's no other place on earth where respect & honor are held in such high regard and the extent of their actions are far beyond what you would even see here in the U.S., . Not only that but the script makes it seem like everyone in Beijing looks the other way when this kid is getting the crap beat out of him. It's really an insult to the Chinese culture on many levels. And are to believe that Jaden Smith's Character learned several months, if not a years, worth of Kung Fu & strength training in the matter of days, only by hanging up a jacket on a mere peg? NO, NO WAY!!! It's about as stupid as thinking you will learn a martial art from Diamond Dave, ""The Redneck Ninja"". I get they're trying to recycle the ""Wax on, Wax off"" example from the Karate Kid 1 but this is just ridiculous. As for the acting of Jaden Smith, his interaction with every cast member is flaky at best and so was his acting overall, especially with his Chinese love interest which seemed more like two 10 year olds trying to carry out a teenage relationship. As a whole, the script is downright terrible and the acting was extremely weak if not dreadful. Although it was entertaining enough and it's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, you should save you money & look for something else.",2011
2,"I'm a fan of the original Karate Kid, this remake is just disappointing. Firstly, there isn't any karate in this movie which makes the title look silly. Secondly, while I'm also a big fan of Jackie Chan, he only had 1 fight scene with a bunch of kids and that lacked his usual comedic and well choreographed fight sequences. Its either his age has finally caught up with him or the kids just didn't have enough training.",2010
5,"Despite having good acting performances from Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, the screenplay destroyed the actors' ability to give the audience a meaningful connection with the characters. The original Karate Kid had an ability to tell a dramatic story that gave great impact to that film. So much so that the ""Karate"" was incidental to the film. Not so in this modern incarnation.

His mother tells him that China is home now, and he must learn to accept his new home. Dre begins to like China when he falls for his classmate Mei Ying (Wenwen Han). Dre's feelings for Mei Ying are seen by Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) the class bully who is out to stop it. Cheng puts Dre to the ground with ease using his Kung Fu training. Dre doesn't have a chance using the little karate that he knows, and Cheng proves it the next time he sees Dre. Dre is getting beaten badly when Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) the maintenance man, secretly a Kung Fu Master, stops the fight. Dre persuades Mr. Han to teach him Kung Fu. With this knowledge, Dre must now face down Cheng in a fight to win his respect in a Kung Fu tournament.",2010

6,"Currently, with a 5.1/10 rating, this is a very underrated film. I don't understand why Jaden Smith is getting so much hate, whether it is because he was ""pushed in"" to the movie business or if it's because he's playing a black person who moves to China, where in the original, the main character is white. I can tell that a large amount of people that voted haven't even seen this before. This film contains beautiful cinematography, great fighting scenes, and fun music for the audience to listen to.",2010
1,"The original Karate Kid (and its remakes) were classic films, which is why they have stood the test of time. Today's remakes have little to do with the original inspirations behind the films. The original Karate Kid was a ""coming of age movie"", which had Karate as a means to set the characters in motion. The casting was brilliant, Morita was the old, unassuming teacher that imparted more than just how to block with his famous ""wax on-wax off"" lesson. Macchio was the perfect teen counterpart - he was every teen, not one with super human or special effects induced skills. The original focused on development of the movie characters, not the action - and it is the simple basics of Macchio's Karate that made his character work and be strong against the more highly skilled Cobra Kai team.",2010
8,"I still have not seen the original, so went into this hearing people saying this not as good. I found this mostly excellent. The two kids did a great job, the tension was mostly set just right. The slow build-up at start was not remotely tedious. The actual gore is just the right level, not over the top. The only scene for me that didn't seem to live up to the rest of it, was when she attacked the police officer after he crept through the house. Don't know what it was, just for me didn't quite match the other tense scenes in the film. At 2 hours, it was the perfect running time. The bullying scenes were well acted by all. Now I can't wait to see Let The Right One In, if it's even better than this, it will be a treat.",2010

They're quite an odd couple, those two. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), undernourished and underweight for his age, has a familiar face, especially to a trio of bullies who hacks on him every chance they get, taunting his girlie looks. But nobody has ever laid eyes on Abby (Chloe Moretz) who's just moved in next door to Owen. She's moody but is otherwise normal, so who'd ever guess that she has been 12 ""for a very long time"" and that she's in fact a vampire?",2010

We were however, shocked that we were the only ones in the cinema and for this reason did not expect the film to be as good as it turned out to be! Having seen the original (Let The Right One In) 18 months ago, I was more impressed with the 2010 remake (which doesn't happen often!) The two main characters Owen and Abbey draw you into the story and into their lives. Owen, a 12 year old boy who has no friends, an alcoholic mother and is being bullied at school and Abbey, a young vampire girl who relies on her keeper to feed her. Also a loner, Abbey befriends Owen and later in the film we learn that he will replace her current keeper (Richard Jenkins). Unlike usual horror films, Let Me In shows the reasoning behind the villains motives and similarly to We Are What We Are, the audience is intrigue by the killer and are let encouraging their behaviour. Unlike We Are What We Are, Let Me In is much more than a horror film, its a story of friendship, teenage anxieties and family break ups and for this reason I give the film 10/10. A highly recommendable, enjoyable, believable portrait of Vampire life (if there were such thing) which is acted and directed faultlessly.",2010

There are no pale heart throbs here, and yet there is more emotion and character investment than a typical slasher film. This positions Let Me in - a remake of the Swedish film, Let the Right One In - as a highly original and enjoyable vampire tale.",2010

9,"""Let Me In"" is a breath of fresh air for fans of the vampire-horror genre that are suffocating on the current teenie-bopper ""Twilight"" trend. The vampire lifestyle is not romanticized or glamorized, with the undead being iconic, aloof, seductive, or misunderstood in the world. A little girl and her father move into a low rent apartment, becoming nameless neighbors, in this instance with the inability to afford shoes. Though presumably this vampire has survived for decades or centuries, she is just a little girl, fumbling through a relationship for the first time. She is not a wizened old soul in the body of a child. She is a child like any other, until her hunger takes control and she becomes something feral. An original, enveloping, American horror movie has not been presented in years. This movie is not an exception (it is a Swedish remake), but it is nice to see something that isn't a remake of a film that is Japanese, or from the 70's. This film is well made and well performed, with a story line new to American audiences, making it definitely worth the ever-inflating price of theater admission.",2010

Eerie and excellent Hollywood remake to the Swedish import vampire film ""Let The Right One In"" scores on all points particularly the smart casting of Smit-McPhee and Moretz (both stars on the rise, justly so) as (respectively) a put-upon tween whose life changes in more ways than one when his new neighbor, a pale barefoot girl, moves in his apartment complex with her dubious guardian (Jenkins in fine low-key form), resulting in a sinister yet romantic kinship. Director Matt Reeves builds up enough suspense, tension and lets the blood flow copiously with élan in this, the finest vampire film since Kathryn Bigelow's ""NEAR DARK"". The poignant puppy-love story and dark underpinnings of the undead and the living attempting to bond is both heart breaking and fear inducing. One of the year's best films (NOTE: Although I didn't see the original foreign film I'm sure it's a worthy adaptation).",2010

The roles portrayed were executed with honesty by all actors involved. The director was clever in not showing the mother's face for very long and we never see the father. The poor lad is left pretty much alone to face the cold, wintry world without a single friend. Then comes the new girl. She seems as utterly sad and alone as he..... and she is. It was refreshing to see how their chemistry blended and bloomed. The only fault I found was the CG attack scenes. That was unbelievable for me. I would have portrayed a vampire as having total control and with slow, deliberate moves. Imagine a fiend that would regard his next meal with detached urgency. That would be much more scary. After all is said I believe that this film will be regarded on it's own as a good love story although with some mayhem and gore that makes a fine cocktail to patiently consider as a film thats heads's above many other horror films .",2010

I found that all three were very different takes on the same tale, each with something very valuable to offer. Lindqvist explored the social context of the tale in far greater detail then either movie - the degenerate society of broken lives and relationships, alcoholism and drug abuse, pedophilia, crime, schoolyard bullying, and vampires.

And in a time where I'm becoming more and more reluctant to watch vampire films, I needed a movie like this to remind me just how good this type of subject matter can be. Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz were phenomenal. They brought a subtlety to there characters that was gently heartbreaking at times, while exquisitely silent and perceptive at others. The dynamic of the characters was tangible, and the viewer ends up with a sense - not of whether the actions of the characters are right or wrong or whether vampirism itself is okay when presented with the face of a 12-year-old girl - but of whether they themselves believe in the rightness or wrongness of where the story takes this young boy.

So Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is still dead and but his legacy still goes on in flashbacks. And in a protégé, Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). And in his widow, Jill (Betsy Russell). The entire soap opera of Jigsaw's family and professional life carries a narrative that attempts to reconcile the final film with the beginning of the franchise, and it definitely does seem to have recapitulated rather well for both hardcore fans as well as fairweather ones. But it has to be said that the films have been on a downward spiral since its fantastic first installment. It delivers the gore in more elaborate ways than the past few films have -- considering how quickly they were rushed out -- but loses that sense of cleverness and more importantly, that sense of menace that the franchise has always attempted to retain.",2011

Since the sixth one was amazing, it's hard to beat that one with the final seventh installment. This time, it is in 3D. Just to cash in on the 3D hype, because let's face it; it's pointless and adds nothing to the movie. ",2010
5,"It was not a perfect movie by any means, but Saw VI was the first Saw movie that really surprised me. Where the other films quickly became standard exercises in torture and brutality, it was the first film in the series that really made an attempt at building and elaborating the overarching storyline that had been developed over the entire series. Instead of merely hinting at things, we were getting full explanations, things began to make sense, and the movie on the whole was just a very satisfying and very enjoyable film. But much like its predecessors, it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger moment – leading us directly into Saw VII, or as it is more sadly referred to, Saw 3D.",2010

Fans and/or gorehounds will love it, and there's enough entertainment for some of those who aren't overly familiar with the series or forgot a thing or two in the previous six films. It is possibly the most appealing ""Saw"" film, knowing that it's ACTUALLY the finale. But where does that leave us with quality? For a ninety minute film with numerous returning characters and just as appealing brand new characters, not to mention the burden of trying to keep originality with a redundant back-story, ""Saw 3D"" does pretty good given the obstacles it's forced to work with. What most people will probably criticize is the lack of twists and turns that made us love the original so much... but lets be honest, has there even been any jaw dropping twists in the series since ""Saw IV"" or even as far back as ""Saw II""? It's up for debate, but the story in the seventh installment is pretty straight forward and that may let some people down.

The 3D factor was fun but it seemed that the movie was revolving around the 3D concept more than the story line. Finally it was way too short, it felt like they were already dragging out what they did have.

I went with incredibly high expectations, and in some ways was not disappointed, however there were a few things i was not overly keen on. (spoilers be warned) The negatives - 1. I expected the final game in the saw franchise to focus on someone rather more related to the saw franchise itself. Bobby's character not being known of or mentioned in any previous films ruined it a bit for me, plus the fact i saw him as a completely unlikable character didn't help. In the previous games there was usually a character that i wanted to prevail and survive (Gorden from Saw, Jeff from Saw 3 for example) but this guy didn't do it for me. 2. I so wanted Hoffman to survive (he is my favourite character) and although he isn't shown pyhsically dying in the film, the end clearly shows he has no way of escape. 3.3D! In many cases 3D films can be incredible, just look at avatar for example, however i feel that this was only 3D for the sake of making it 3d, it added nothing to the story and ultimately would have been just as good in 2D. This may just be me but i also thought that the 3D element of the film made it almost too shiny and polished. Saw in 3D just felt too gimmicky when the main focus should have been the fact that it was the last film in the series! The Positives - 1. The traps were pretty fantastic. They were far more imaginative than i expected. I thought Chester Bennington's car trap scene was brutal whilst being clear it was cleverly thought out. I wont go into every trap in detail as it would take too long but there are certainly some imaginative ones in there. 2. Despite Hoffman's demise at the end, he played the bad ass antagonist perfectly. The fact that he chose the old school reverse bear trap on Jill was perfect and throughout the film he remained ruthless. Even at the end when he was chained up, he went straight for the saw, in my eyes again proving he would do anything to survive. 3. The acting, i've heard from a few people that the acting was below par, i on the other hand did not find this to be the case. I thought every character played their role well. 4. The ending, despite predictable to some, was straight up epic. Lawrence Gorden's story was revealed and him ending it with the famous line ""Game over!"" gave me chills. Overall - In my opinion not one of the Saw films has surpassed the original, due to its pure originality and legitimately shocking twist. Saw 3D didn't have an incredible story, it had a slightly predictable twist but the bottom line is it wrapped the franchise up, answering (most) questions and was a fun film along the way. If you have seen the others and enjoyed them then you can't afford to miss this.",2010
3,"I don't know where to start. I have been a fan of the saw movies from the start. The first one was mind blowing. It was so entertaining due to the fact that it was a psychological thriller that kept you on your feet. They didn't push it with the gore, and it was a thoughtful, intense, thriller with an interesting idea. When Saw II came I knew it wasn't going to be as good, and it wasn't. It was more focused on blood and gore, and less focused on quality. Saw III was fine. It was pretty bloody, but the great story line leveled that out. The movies obviously deteriorated as the series continued, and the producers cared more about money, than quality. Saw IV, V, and VI did their jobs, but weren't as good as the first few. ",2010
1,"This movie had nothing to offer. Just a bunch of sadistic scenes with the worst story line ever, made for people who just want to see some guts splattered all over the floor that being their highest level of understandable entertainment they could enjoy. The traps were so stupid and so easy to pass by a normal person that you needed an actor who could be very good to play such a stupid character. Each trap can be solved in how much time you need if you just don't listen to the stupid tape and the last scene you can just put your feet around the chain and pull yourself up. This movie is a waste of money, I want my money back! If you were expecting some clever genius killing people for a well established reason in his point of view, it's not here. If you want to see blood and body parts flying around and think it's such a hard thing to be done with today's equipment and only a misunderstood genius could think that blood and dead people is something that has a deeper meaning, go and enjoy.",2010
6,"There is no denying the impact the Saw series has had on not only the horror genre, but movies in general. Starting off as a little low-budget psychological thriller centred around two guys in a basement, this series has smashed box office records and created a new horror villain in Jigsaw. Since 2004 audiences have flocked to watch new victims meet their demise in an inventive and cruel way while relishing the inane plot twists and convoluted story, whilst others have condemned the series as ""torture porn"" and nothing but sick people coming up with sick traps for sick audiences.",2010
1,"OK i was really excited to see how the SAW writers will end this successful horror/mystery franchise. since I'm a huge fan of SAW, i followed every interview made with the cast of this movie before going to c the film, from the writers of this franchise(Patrick Melton-Marcus Dunstan)& director Kevin Greutert to the main actors like Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Cary Elwes and Betsy Russell. ",2010
6,"I was lucky enough to have seen this movie yesterday, and I went in with high expectations thinking that Kevin Greutert was behind the camera again. But I was sadly disappointed. Saw 3D was a jumbled mess. Only towards the end did it really pay off. And even then, there were STILL things I didn't like. Such as: Dr. Gordon. Why oh why was he in on it the entire time? That is almost bad enough to nearly ruin parts of the first one for me. I mean really? The writers couldn't have come up with an ending that will satisfy all Saw fans, and not just the Gordonites? Seriously! He saws his foot off in desperation to save his family, he cauterizes his wound, he is taken in by John, who heals his wound, then Gordon just decides to side with him? WHAT?! And the worst part is, they don't even shed some light on that. All they do, is show John take him in, heal his wound, then show him doing all of the things a doctor would need to do for the traps, such as the key behind Michael's eye in Saw II, the stitches put on Trevor and Art in Saw IV, and I think that's it. I HATED that. And there was a scene where Dr. Gordon goes up to John and shows Lynn Denlon from Saw III and states that ""she'll be perfect."" UGH. And if you haven't guessed by now, the package that Jill drops off at the hospital was for Dr. Gordon. Other problems I had with Saw 3D: the acting, the effects, the characters, the unanswered questions, the fact that Cary Elwes and Tobin Bell were BARELY IN THE MOVIE, and the no montage at the end. I could go on, but I seriously would come off as a hater, which I'm not. The ending, on the other hand, was great. It's something that we've ALL expected and wanted for a very long time. It shouldn't disappoint anyone. Predictable or not, we've ALL wanted it to happen. So don't complain that it was predictable. I have an extremely hard time accepting this as a part of the Saw series, just because of the pure fact that no Saw movie is BAD, except for this one. There are also so many more reasons, but I don't want to continue. Saw 3D is easily the worst Saw. Anyone who disagrees with that is either new to the series, or is a Gordonite. I mean, everyone has their own opinion, but I mean come on. I am extremely disappointed. This was just a big slap to the face for all hardcore Saw fans. And I don't blame Kevin Greutert. I blame the writers and the producers for this. Saw 3D was a mess, but I'm sure Saw VII would have been a good movie.",2010
10,"I had the great fortune to see this film at the closing gala of the Festival del Cine Español en Màlaga. I have been a great fan of the work of Julio Medem ever since I saw 'La Ardilla Roja' some 15 years ago. And his latest film doesn't disappoint either. However, it is in some ways a departure for him. He said so himself at the press conference the day before the screening. He called it the 'most simple film' he has made so far. This is certainly true as the story is quite straightforward and (apart from a few small scenes), the entire film concentrates on its 2 female protagonists. It is no secret that the film is based on the Chilean film 'En la cama' by Matias Bize. But Medem has made the material entirely his own and developed it in a completely different way. The only things in common with the previous film is that they both charter the encounter of 2 people who only just met during one night in a hotel room. But that's where the similarities stop. Of course the biggest difference is that here the protagonists are both women. Ever since 'Lucia y el sexo' Medem has been concentrating more and more on the exploration of the female psyche. This was most evident in his previous film, the (apart from the end) masterful, yet very misunderstood 'Caotica Ana'. But whereas that film ambitiously delved into deep philosophical questions about the subjugation of the female over 2,000 years of patriarchy, here this exploration takes a simpler, though no less profound form - the exploration of female love & sensuality. Having 2 women instead on a mixed couple (or 2 men for that matter), allowed Medem to concentrate on this aspect without any distraction. He said at the press conference that for a number of years now he has been discovering and exploring his own feminine side. And it is exactly this which gives the film its universal appeal, instead of being 'just a lesbian' tale. The feelings and sentiments expressed & shown will resonate with every viewer, regardless of their sex and/or sexual orientation. This is probably also in no small way due to the involvement of both actresses in the shaping of their characters as well as the final script (Medem re-wrote the screenplay a number of times to incorporate their inputs & ideas). And their respective performances are excellent. There is real chemistry between Elena Anaya and Natasha Yarovenko - without this the film just wouldn't have worked. Both give very subtle and nuanced performances as what begins as just a night of fun & sex gradually turns into something far deeper as both characters realise they are falling in love, something neither had bargained for. Guarded at first, telling each stories which may or may not be true, both women start bit by bit to reveal more about themselves until in the end their souls are as naked as their bodies. A couple of months ago a so-called promo circulated on the internet, cobbled together from stolen material from the first week of shooting, which suggests the film is no more than a voyeuristic soft-core fest. But nothing could be further from the truth! Yes, both are naked most of the films running time, and yes, there is some sex. But the sex is beautifully filmed and essential within the story line. And the fact that they are naked is just that, a natural fact! They would be, given the situation, and one soon forgets about it. What matters are the characters and the way they develop and interact with each other. Being quasi a 2-hander, the film does have quite a theatrical feel. Most of the dialogue is in English. That seems only natural, as one girl is Spanish and the other Russian, both meeting in Italy. This allows for some poignant moments when neither can really express what their feel in this foreign language and start speaking in their own tongues - which, of course, the other can't understand. But Medem also works with silences - some of the most profound realizations happen just with facial expressions. Intervowen in all this are the directors trademark poetic touch, with references to philosophy, art & history, as well as to his own films - there is even a reference to his next project, Aspasia (look her up on Wikipedia!). Coupled with excellent, atmospheric camera work (well, it is a Julio Medem film after all) and an evocative soundtrack with music by Jocelyn Pook and Russian Red, this is a deeply touching and satisfying film, one that stays with you. At least for me, but judging by the long standing ovation for Medem, Elena Anaya, Natasha Yavorenko plus the film's producer, Alvaro Longoria at the end, I don't seem to be the only one who feels like that.",2010
9,"Julio Medem's ""Room in Rome"" is the tale of a Spanish lesbian who, one night in Rome, picks up a Russian girl who has never been with a woman before. At first the girl is nervous and after some foreplay in the lesbian's hotel room, she gets cold feet and sneaks away while the other girl is sleeping. But she has forgotten her mobile phone. She returns to the hotel room and knocks on the door. The other girl answers the door naked just as a waiter comes to deliver food to the room next door. She doesn't cover herself up but tells the waiter they may want some food later. And so begins a night of games, fantasies, laughter, love-making and the baring of souls as well as bodies.",2011

I use to believe that love was only heterosexual, but after seeing actors portray the genitility of love so elegantly, my world had changed. This movie should receive every award, from best picture to best actor. Also the song choice is stunning. Loving Stranger, could not have been a better choice. This movie is sentimental, lustful, and relates to something everyone can understand, which is why in my opinion it is a classic. To the actors, and director I bid them a fine job, and this movie will go down in the histories, as one of the greats if not the great.",2012
7,"There is no real reason why I should like this film. There are literally hundreds of films like this. Two people who've never met each other before fall in love over night and it's all because of coincidental circumstances. We've seen it before, a thousand times.",2011
10,"First, I saw this film in September. In October I had a chance to see it on a big screen at the Baltic Pearl Festival in Riga. I have to say, that this film can be seen more than once. You can watch it over and over again and every time you'll get a pleasure. First of all, great directing, the music was just amazing, camera operator did a great job, and acting: Elena Anaya played her part perfectly - she can smile as a child, in a few seconds she can cry as it really hurts. Amazing! I respect this actress! Natasha Yarovenko can not be compared with Anaya. I don't know if she is an actress,but if she is, then not the best one. But(!) that was the raisin of the whole movie, Natasha was so unprofessional, that it made me believe that this story really happens. I mean this Russian accent, sometimes she looked just stupid, but are we perfect in reality? Natasha made me believe in everything that happened that night in Rome, Alba made me feel every single emotion as if I were there in that hotel room.",2010

At beginning of the movie i just thought that the sex was hot(purely in my animal way). but when the movie preceded i was,like , this is what a love should feel like. at this point i want to say that i'm not gay(whatsoever).when i was at one point of the movie, if anyone were to ask me 'what is the most beautiful thing in the world?""..i answer would've been ""mmm, i don't know,lesbian!"".",2011

Room in Rome is not only the story of two girls who meet one evening and then stay together for one night only, never to see each other again, but it is the story of what each one of us truly wants in our love and sex lives. Something new, fresh, exciting and personal. ",2016
6,"More than a movie, I'd say it is a theatrical play. I didn't see the Chilean version, so I will not compare. A few moments into the movie, you completely forget the actresses are naked. The sex scenes are short bursts in between lies, truths, laughs, silences. However explicit they may be, they are not erotic. They felt more like hunger, like running away. It is intense, but it's a strange intensity - it did not provoke us empathy, or emotional connection with the characters. It left me not really caring what happens to them after the movie ends. Also, at times, the intensity is almost baroque, as if being in Rome made it have some Italian comedy touches that felt out of place. The chemistry between the actress is good enough to have them hold a movie that tries too hard not to try too hard. The lighting and photography are great. I liked how the outside world seeps in through mobile phones, computers, even the paintings on the walls. I don't know if I'd recommend it; I will watch it again - on DVD, and see if knowing what to expect, it gets better. It just left me pretty cold.",2010

Yes there is a lot of nudity and sexual acts but by the third time it simply gets in the way, although understandably crucial to the movie. It is just a wonderful movie. I wish it would have ended differently. For once I would have liked a Hollywood ending. I was very saddened that the two women parted ways.",2010

You starting to think life, problems in our life, desires, feelings, how fragile we are, pain of goodbye's etc. Like i said, mixed feelings.

Errol Flynn made that movie ""The Adventures Of Robin Hood"" in 1939 and people still watch it today, 77 years later, with utter delight. Russell Crowe's ""Robin Hood"" was made only 7 years ago and it's already forgotten. I was appalled by his comment and realized that Oscar winner or not, wisdom or knowledge is not part of the equation.

1,"Okay, here is he awful truth:",2010
1,"Robin Hood was an Outlaw in England. The idea that Robin Hood followed King Richard in the Crusades is from the Sean Connery movie ""Robin and Marion"". Robin and Marion was made in the cynical 1970's. Robin and Marion is not a movie that gets watched a lot (I wouldn't sit through it again) and it's theme didn't need to get expanded in to a two hour epic. The traditional Robin Hood takes place in England for it is the story of the British People Saxon's vs the Norman occupiers. Green is the symbolic color of the native people of Briton (e.g. Gawain and the Green Knight). The traditional Robin Hood of legend wore green for he is part of the pagan history of Briton, not some cynical inner city trendy who wears black. There is this idea that people in the past wore depressing clothing and were dirty all the time. Yet if you look at the paintings from the time of King Richard the first you will find that people wore bright colors. Only bums dress badly in any age.",2010

Indeed, we couldn't imagine less from the people assembled on the project.

The plot is immediately both compelling and fresh with regards to the well known tale.",2010
1,"Robin Hood is apparently Russell Crowe's ""Water World"". The movie, by Ridley Scott, is designed to be a historical production of Robin Hood, or that's my understanding based on the cinematography. The movie is so poorly constructed however, and the tactics so ridiculous, the audience actually broke out in laughter at several, serious, parts. The culminating battle at the end was terrible. In fact, Maid Marrian storming the beach with the 'lost boys' of Sherwood Forest at the end had us almost rolling. Of course the landing craft and the D-Day re-enactment scenes captured by Mr. Scott only added to our mirth... Seriously don't pay to see this movie.",2010
5,"Robin Hood is a very professionally made film. Great actors, great production design, great images. It is nice to watch because you feel you are in the capable hands of Ridley Scott. But do not expect to be amazed by the story or the acting. Apart from dame Marion, the characters are two dimensional and predictable. The film pretends to be historically correct, but is of course a well dressed fantasy. There are a few battle scenes, filmed in the Gladiator way. They are exciting, but not very convincing. In fact, they are completely ridiculous when you think you are watching a historically correct film. The worst for me were the boats in the final battle, apparently trying to induce a D-Day feeling.

5,"Ridley Scott aimed to bring Robin Hood down to earth and in that straightforward respect he was successful. The problem is that he arguably brought Robin Hood CRASHING down to earth, jammed like a square peg in a round hole into a generic semi-epic of medieval warfare and political intrigue. Change the names of Robin, Little John, Marian, and the village of Nottingham and I'd pretty much have no idea that this screenplay was ever written with the intention of being a Robin Hood movie — even the villain, a French spy and marauder named Godfrey, is a brand new creation, with the Sheriff reduced to a piddling, zero-impact supporting character. It ends up feeling like a little bit of Robin Hood mythos accidentally leaked onto a print of Braveheart or Gladiator so they said to hell with it and decided to release it in theaters, albeit with the bloodshed dialed back to PG-13 levels.",2010
1,"As an admirer of Ridley Scott's work - especially ""Gladiator"" but above all the totally outstanding ""Kingdom of Heaven"" - my wife and I went to see this in the cinema with some ""good"" expectations. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait for the whole farrago to come to a painful conclusion. The film is a total mess because its screenplay is simply horrendous. It has no proper ""story"" or structural narrative, the whole thing being like a quilt made up of different strands of so-called ""story"", which are then stitched together at odd times [""stiched-up"" for the audience is a better description] in the forlorn hope that this will somehow make a ""whole"" thing emerge on the screen. The fault lies entirely with the scriptwriter, Brian Helgeland, for the most total rubbish screenplay I have ever seen - as well as with Ridley Scott for allowing himself to spend money and time filming this rubbish. Other commentators - especially ""justin 55839"": ""A Disaster of a Movie"" - have correctly picked up all the holes in the script and the film. This film really needs to be consigned to the rubbish bin. The only thing that kept me somehow half-interested was listening to the excellent soundtrack. Except there again, certain horrors of horror kept coming to the fore. I couldn't believe I was hearing 19th or 20th century Irish folk music as the background to the olde ye English folks people of the 12th century enjoying themselves around the village camp fires at night! Thank goodness the other two films of Scott's I mentioned above will help to keep his reputation intact.",2010
4,"As the recent King Arthur, Hollywood destroys a British myth by making the hero a war leader! You can argue what you want: Robin Hood is the good figure who steals the rich to give the poor!

So it's particularly stupid and things gets aggravated with his poor romance (he takes the identity of a dead husband to get the wife!)... Sure with Scott directing, the movie is beautifully shot but he confirms his senility with another shameful choice of script!

I chose the director's cut from the DVD I rented. Each time I had to pause for some reason didn't matter much. The Eleanor of Acquataine character as well as King John were boring as well. I would not have enjoyed this in the theater as there was simply not enough to it. Sean Connery's version is a little better but not much. Stick with Braveheart.

No, this particular take on the story of Robin Hood is very different - like none you've ever seen before. Even the historical setting is changed from what's usually offered. Here, rather than waiting out the evil regency of Prince John and his minions until King Richard returns from the Crusades, Richard is already dead. His death comes very early on in the movie in battle in France. John is the King of England in this movie, and rather than an unselfish ""robbing the rich to give to the poor"" type character, Robin (actually in this movie Robin Longstride, who finds himself impersonating Robert of Locksley and becomes known as ""Robin of the Hood"") is a more complex character. I wouldn't say exactly noble - especially in the beginning - and his battle is not so much for the poor as it's a battle for the ""rights"" of the English people, as he eventually takes on what seems to be the fight to get John to sign what I assume is Magna Carta, and at least temporarily has to ally himself with John to help lead the defence of England against a French invasion.",2011

2,"When Kevin Costner made it to play Robin Hood I was worried for all the good reasons, and was not disappointed, when I heard that Ridley Scot was preparing Robin Hood I was looking forward to it, I was sure there would have been some fantasies like in Gladiator but not the point of turning the movie into a boring pile of crap that is not even speaking of Robin Hood but Robert of Luxley.",2010
9,"When I saw who the producers are, I must admit, I felt some trepidation. The Borne Trilogy was good (no self-respecting film lover could deny it), but hardly TV series material. All my trepidation flew out of the window less than five minutes into the pilot. I'm not an easy judge to please, but I must say, I'm hooked.",2010
3,"I really had hoped that this show would be as well done and fun as the recent USA slate (Royal Pains, White Collar,etc) but this show was mediocre at best and just plain bad at worst.",2010
1,"the whole show does not make any sense, main character is hired as a cia agent because of only one reason that she speaks few languages, she does not know or carry firearm which is surprising, she is not even good in hand hand combat...which really does not make any sense why she was hired in the first place.....in almost all the episode it feels like that she gets into the situation but some how she manages it ...which feels more of luck or the twisted story...how can be covert operations be so simple...usually the intelligence field operative are more highly trained for hand to hand combat and special fire arm training then other law enforcement agency. But this show fails to deliver anything ...its more of a family show for kids not a spy show...no to very little action...family drama in cia thats even hilarious ..that husband and wife are running cia and wife is using agency resources to spy on her husband.....crappy and unrealistic....",2013
1,"Bland, mostly air, and refuses to go down. ",2010
6,"The good news is that this was appealing in terms of actors and characters and relationships. But the storyline and plotting--ridiculous. To some extent it is another example of Hollywood chutzpah--petite blonde takes on most dangerous killer in the world. Right. In real life, he just puts a bullet in her head in the restaurant kitchen. And 1st day agent winds up violating rules and going off on her own? And why doesn't she just tell her boss about the clues in the first place? Right--it's Hollywood and every boss is stupid. It's hard to ignore the gaping holes in the pilot episode, but for all that it was still fun.",2010
3,"I am a huge fan of USA's original programming. They have a great working model: a character-focused premise with interesting story lines. Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Psyche, Monk -- all great shows, some of my favorites. Unfortunately, ""Covert Affairs"" fails to live up to its predecessors.",2010
8,This show reminds me a little of Alias. If you liked that you probably will like this. Although it is not as heavy as that it still is filled will female kick butt attitude. I love the fact that it feels like a light spy show that is just as fun as it is action-packed. Piper Perabo is fantastic as the lead and makes you want to be part of her spy crew. The storyline could use a little bit of work and maybe a bit more fleshing out but for the moment it is working fine.,2014
9,"Covert Affairs is a show that starts interesting and with each season grows in it's entertainment and level engagement as the story line deepen and grow. Half way through season 5 I'm updating this review and my rating as season 4 took to a level few shows achieve with me. I like how they've taken us with a novice CIA agent at the beginning who gets progressively better with each season with her starting as a talented rookie she quickly raises her stock to a driven professional who has gone dark and from not carrying a gun to plugging the bad guys with regularity, and satisfaction (mine). The depth and intensity of the story grows right along with the character such that by the beginning of Season 4 each show is leaving me at the point where I can't stop and need to see the next episode to get more answers. Since I am streaming the show this only presents the problem of burning through the episodes to fast and being left without a favorite show to watch sooner than I would like. ",2014
8,"This is the first good spy-type series I've seen since 24 (looking forward to its return on FOX)and Alias (such fun with all the disguises, gadgets and mystic aspect). I was SO happy to have recently discovered Covert Affairs! This show is thoroughly entertaining if you enjoyed 24 and/or Alias. And - stop comparing - they're all different. I definitely enjoy the characters in this show. I am now into the 4th season and, even though there are some things that should be made logical with just a few sentences of explanation, and there is the inevitable craziness in all shows - like getting from the U.S. to Europe in just the right location in the middle of nowhere in - seemingly a few hours instead of a day - just in time for someone (like the elusive Ben, Eyal or Teo) to save Annie's life. Of COURSE, we're happy - big phew! And who cares if it's implausible - it's a TV show that needs to keep moving along. Purists will nit pick, but I would say anyone who likes this genre will find it totally intriguing entertaining and compelling. I always look forward to seeing what twist is coming up next. I hope it keeps going for years without the writers getting bored and killing off the best characters and ruining the series.",2013
10,"Great new show - good writing, excellent casting. Especially Oded Fehr - like to see more of him.",2010
8,"If you like Piper Perabo, you will probably like this show. Her character, Annie, is a CIA agent who hits the ground running right out of training. It helps that she is something of a prodigy--excellent with weapons, amazing at hand-to-hand combat, and a whiz with languages. Though she sometimes has to confront her personal fears, for the most part she is determined to tackle any problem by immersing herself in the heart of the matter.",2014
1,"There are some things that are just not very professional when making this movie. Let's start with the stunts, they look very cheap, some are just awful, especially when driving is concerned and not to mention gun shots that never hits the main characters, come on. And now Annie, who ""speaks"" some languages, she's like a miss know it all, she doesn't look like an agent who can take combat and be all lo-vie-do-vie, her accents when speaking a foreign language are awful, at least they could have prepped her before acting to loose the American accent, it's typical for most Americans that come abroad, but as an agent probably you have to pass all that. One more thing, the movie reflects perfectly the image of the CIA: deceitful, and driven only to killing people.",2011
7,"This show is turning out to be what I wanted Alias to be. The similarities can't be missed really. Strong female spy with big doe eyes and a b cup, wandering around in skimpy outfits somehow kicking ass in spike heals (this always bothers me so much. I spend so much of female led action shows just staring at the foot where in dismay) but also managing family and home, occasionally crumbling in the arms of a strong scruffy man. But unlike Alias this show avoids some pitfalls. ",2010
10,"A fresh new spy drama ala Alias, but with a lead that is more the girl next door. This character is a lovable, soft family girl that seamlessly switches to a hard core savvy linguist and spy. The CIA leaders, staff and sidekicks are also very dynamic characters. Her family members are wonderful and validate the secret life persona.",2010
10,"Love, love, love Covert Affairs. Finally a TV show with strong female characters. Every week I am on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will happen next. Love the cast- they really did a great job choosing these actors. I want to be Annie! She is intelligent, strong, and gets the job done. I also like the type of boss Joan is- she keeps it together and then reveals that she is thinking what we want her to think and she does the right thing. I also like that the character of Auggie is a blind ex-soldier. Yes he is blind, but it is amazing how he approaches it. I am not sure what the future hold for this show, but I would definitely like it to continue on.",2010
7,"Covert Affairs is fast-paced, funny at times and charming in a way. This drama provides a less cynical view of intelligence work compared to other similar dramas. Though having the habit of blasting maudlin pop ballads to signal Annie's moodier moments it has action scenes — particularly a hotel room barrage of sniper fire in the pilot episode — of first rate. The series is not as taut or intense as ""24"" or the ""Bourne"" trilogy but works on the whole and when the nation seems nostalgic for cold war simplicity, this espionage drama answers the call. Action sequences — gunfire, car chases and hand-to-hand combat — but also emotional turmoils. Acceptable overall.",2015
10,"An excellent Season 4 stretches the range of this already-fascinating series: with good writing, and some fine acting --",2013
3,"This is a flashy, modern, well-done show with lots of pretty girls and boys and costume changes and chase scenes and shoot-outs. Piper Perabo is always a treat. Good, wholesome, mindless summer entertainment that's sure to be a hit. ",2010
7,"USA is my favorite network. Of the networks 7 shows, I watch 5 of them (Psych, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, White Collar, and now Covert Affairs). When I first heard about Covert Affairs, I didn't think it'd be good. I figured I'd still give it a chance though, and it turned out to be good. Though it's my least favorite of the 5, it's still a show that I plan on following through out it's run. The characters are great, though I wish they'd get the supporting characters involved more. I know it's based around Annie but I think the other characters should have more to do than help her from the head quarters. Anyway, there's my little review.",2010
7,"""Covert Affairs"" rates a solid 7-8 stars for me based on one thing: It's an entertaining show, plain and simple.",2010
9,"For those reviewers bashing this show because it's not Alias, I think you're missing the point. Yes, the show is spy themed, but it's much more character driven. Piper Perabo's character is learning that being a spy is going to take a toll on her family life, and there is also a good conflict building between the Campbells regarding their failed marriage. I prefer to think of it as a spy show with heart, and honestly it's much better written than many of USA's other action-adventure shows, simply because it has developed some pretty deep characters with only a few episodes.",2010
2,"My God I was at the edge of my seat for the entire program. I am trying to figure out why I did this and then it hit methe show lasted way too long. Covert Affairs is a concoction of mundane plots and overbearing stars who seem to always be so skilled at leading potentially good programs to early demises. Pretty much a menu for most short-lived programs, this mixture requires a main character who is not a only good looking blond, but also a rookie, and of course she knows more than anybody else in the show. Sprinkled around the edges of this romp are politically correct villains and a fare share of professional victims who are just so smart it baffles the mind...and according to this show, the they're in charge of our nation's security. Wowzers...I am sure the worker-bees feel quite secure knowing their bosses handle crisis by preferring to whimper about their own personal perceived shortcomings than cover the backsides of their operatives. This show is just as much a fail as many other new programs are hitting the market these days. It has potential but PC trumps storyline. I doubt it will get itself out of the cute little hole it has thrown itself into. This show is very appealing to many, and I am happy for them. I am not that impressed, but I do wish it luck.",2010
1,"I am watching a re-run of the pilot of Covert Affairs, trying to give it another chance.",2010
9,"Of course all that occurs here is 100% ridiculous , not possible,total fiction even science fiction but thats the beauty of Covert Affairs.Although sometimes I wonder why anyone would present the CIA as been operated by a married couple like it was their own souvenir shop. However,every chapter stands on its own, although there is a thread that goes between all chapters.This is fast paced chain of events,where we are taken to actual locations around the globe.There is suspense, mystery, romance , nice entertaining sometimes funny 45 minutes.Christopher Gorham is amazing in his character a a Blind Ops tech Handler Auggie Anderson.he is indeed amazing.,Gregory Itzin is again the slimy crooked manipulative character , just like in 24!",2015
9,"I watched first for the Bourne Trilogy connection and the action scenes generally live up to that high energy standard -- hard to do on a television show budget. I also watched for Piper Perabo (lead Annie Walker) and was pleased to discover other actors I like including Christopher Gorham as a charming, blind confidant. The music is both current and well geared to the themes. In look, sound and acting, Covert Affairs is off to a credible and engaging start. I feared a simple remake of Alias on a lower budget. Instead Covert Affairs is delivering another of its successful episodic ""character"" shows with self-contained stories that advance a longer story arc. Covert Affairs so far is both more grounded in the real world than Alias and offers a bit of humor or every day charm to leaven the action and inevitable dealings with bad guys.",2010
10,"I think the reports and those who claim to have fainted when watching this is probably highly exaggerated. Sure it's graphic, but nothing not already seen in a typical torture porn film. Danny Boyle doesn't exploit this inevitable moment through lingering shots or in your face techniques, but does enough to bring forth the sheer horror and pain of the entire 127 hours ordeal that culminates with a none too pretty or neat self amputation of a limb, taking care of addressing and cutting through skin, meat, bone and tendon.",2011
9,"Despite having the opportunity to see Darren Aronofsky's absolutely extraordinary masterpiece Black Swan at this year's past Toronto International Film Festival, I did regret missing out on Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. The film was one of the few to emerge from the festival with momentous Oscar buzz, and even a bit of controversy over a specific scene late in the film that was causing people to faint in theatres.",2010
9,"I came into this movie with high expectations. Danny Boyle, who brought us 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE had a lot to live up to with the quality of prior movies, and he did not disappoint. He brought the challenge of creating an interesting movie based on our main character being immobile to life, and captivating it was. Being stuck with our main character the entire duration of the film was anything but tedious, as we follow the thoughts of canyoneer Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he gets trapped under a rock while exploring the beautiful sights of Utah. The camera does a fabulous job taking us everywhere a wandering mind might migrate in a situation such as this.",2010
8,"You know, when I first heard about this movie. I didn't really know what to expect, as all I knew was it was based on a true story about a guy getting stuck in a canyon due to a boulder. I decided to give it a shot and well, I was amazed by this movie. Danny Boyle continues to give us impressive cinematography and incredible performances in his movie, thanks to James Franco, who plays as Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who gets stuck under the boulder if you didn't already know.",2011
8,"You may be dying but the world moves on. That is the naked truth about our existence and the main allegory written in the stimulating visual experience provided by Danny Boyle in his latest film. 127 Hours is a wonderful metaphor for solitude and for the importance of what life means at an individual level. It enhances the indescribable experience of having a family, friends and love, but most of all cherishes the meaning of human contact. Solitude is perceived as being bearable and a lot of times needed but seldom is viewed as being fulfilling. Only when the epiphany pops into our minds, we realize what we have been missing. It is a common and frustrating fact. Nonetheless, Danny Bolyle's achievement allows a new and fresh take on this theme. The director shows the audiences that life happens when they least expect. And truth be told, there is a bright place for those who abandon their egotistical ""independence"" and start sharing the events that life provides.",2010
10,"Sometimes (even oftentimes) in the world of film criticism, the word ""triumphant"" is thrown around. It's often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. I've certainly used it; it's a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it's more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel I've never used ""triumphant"" in the correct critical context before.",2010
9,"As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films (""28 Days Later"") to foreign coming-of-age love stories (""Slumdog Millionaire""), Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in ""127 Hours,"" he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.",2010
10,"I started loving this film within the first few seconds. 127 Hours begins immediately with the sound of Fresh Blood's ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" (""There must be some f*%#ing chemical, chemical in your brain, that makes us different from animals, makes us all the same."" etc...) just as featured in the 1st trailer. That not-ripped-off euphoric feeling (how many times have you seen a trailer with a perfect song/music and then felt betrayed that it wasn't in the film later... yeah, me too) carried on all the way through the rest of the film.",2010
8,"You have probably heard the story about the man that went canyoneering, alone, in Utah in 2003, not telling anyone where he was going. Five days later he emerged out of the Utah canyons, missing an arm. He had become wedged between a rock and a hard place (literally) and eventually had to cut his own arm off in order to survive. If you were like me you probably thought to yourself, ""Wow, what an awful experience, I bet that sucks. Oh well, back to my life."" The truth is that the self amputation handiwork is not even close to what the man, Aron Ralston, had to go through for the first 124 hours of his ordeal. Having read ""It's Not About the Bike"" by Lance Armstrong, I think it is fair to compare the two stories not only about survivorship but also about the bigger picture in which we call ""life."" You have probably also heard how Armstrong survived testicular cancer to go on to win the Tour De France seven times. Again you might have thought to yourself ""Wow, he had a small bout with cancer and now everything is all right. Oh well, back to my life."" The severe gravity of these situations don't settle in until you hear or see the personal stories of what these individuals endured to earn their lives back. Danny Boyle, is the director who helped bring Ralston's excruciating story to the screen in ""127 Hours."" Boyle, with an eclectic resume including a movie about heroin addiction (""Trainspotting""), a movie about two youngsters finding a bag of money (""Millions""), and a Bollywood movie (""Slumdog Millionaire""), focused on the events that put the viewer in Ralston's position then made that viewer understand that there was only two ways out of the cavern.",2010
9,"Danny Boyle deserves all the credit in the world for this directorial achievement. Personally, I think he did an outstanding thing taking on a subject which is hard to put on screen for one hour and half and keep you interested in the character and keep things entertaining: the true story of Aron Ralston, a mountain climber who had to resort to one of the most desperate measures in order to fade death.",2011
6,"An empty guy falls into a hole, spends a lot of time in there looking for ways out and into himself, finding that his life was empty. He then cuts his arm and liberates himself. Period. That's the plot. What was good: music, some scenes with his camcorder. What was bad: shaky camera work, lack of any food for thought. I could not detect any character development, although some of the reviewers were exulting about the human spirit etc. What I saw was a reckless alpha-male, who even in that terrible situation kept thinking about females and even attempted to masturbate. Unless you are into one-man-horror movies, skip this one. A 6 out of 10 is a very generous vote here - this work is very mediocre.",2011
4,"In fairness the film takes on a fairly difficult concept and to this end feel some sympathy towards it. However as far as films go this is drawn out. In some respects I suppose it is as expected. Lots of deep breathing and over done focus on a chap stuck down a hole. Thankfully, his moments of delirium,brings a little variety to the all too long and drawn scenario. Felt the film was more for the geek rather than someone wanting to see something enjoyable. I had hoped for a little more about the character and more to surround the scenario giving it build up. These aspects were lost. Given Danny Boyle's previous films have been of such an impeccable standard, this film has certainly not come up to that grade. Perhaps though taking such a minimalist theme was just a step to far.",2011
9,"Danny Boyle has always been an indie favourite, consistently producing  excellent films in many different genres. However, his films never  enjoyed the box-office reach they deserved. That is, until his 2008  surprise blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire broke all expectations. It was  a film that would then allow Danny Boyle to create whatever film  project he wanted, with presumably whatever budget he needed.   This is a dream situation for any director, but instead of taking the  opportunity to direct a massive budget film, he writes and directs, 127  Hours. The film, which tells the incredible true story of Aron Ralston,  could be handled in incredibly different ways. Luckily, Boyle's film  about a man having to cut off his own arm doesn't leave you feeling  depressed, but rather it is energetic and life-affirming. The film  doesn't tone down any of the difficult aspects, in fact it throws them  right in your face. However, what makes this film so fantastic, is that  Boyle's style matches Ralston's view on life and explanation for  surviving the awful ordeal.   The film begins at a furiously kinetic pace, one you would be hard  pressed to find in an action film. It is a jolt to the senses and it  sets the perfect mood for the film. It is not making light of a  terrible situation but rather putting you in the mind set that Aron  Ralston was in before the accident occurred. What makes this  directorial decision so important is the fact that without  understanding the kind of person he was, we couldn't understand how he  survived the awful ordeal he was in.  This is what makes Boyle perfect for the material, where another  director would most likely go very minimalist, Boyle goes all out in  terms of style, without ever losing the emotional connection. Boyle's  stylistic choices heighten emotional integrity where as other  directors' use of style is often just visual stimulation.   As important Boyle's direction was to making the film great, if it were  not for James Franco's performance as Aron, the film would have failed.  Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career, if not  his best. His performance could very easily have become showy and  overly dramatic, yet Franco was smart enough to restrain himself until  the moment called for dramatics.   It would be a real shame to forget the unsung heroes of this film, the  two directors of photography; Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle.  As the film features, for the most part, one man on screen for the  duration, Boyle decided to make the visuals into their own characters.  To do this, he employed two fantastic directors of photography to make  the visuals competing characters. As the film progressed, remembering  the incredibly impressive shots became harder and harder, to a point  where I lost count. The film features some of the most memorable shots  of Boyle's career, many of which leave you wondering how they possibly  accomplished them.  Danny Boyle has made a career of films about men who are pushed to  their absolute limits, yet the films always leave you feeling better  than when you arrived. He does not muddy his films with sentimentality  or out of place scenes to make the audience feel better, but his films  still leave you feeling an energy for life. It is his talent of finding  the strength within people and his natural ability to present it to us  that makes his films so powerful. 127 Hours is one of the rare films  that leaves an audience in their seats during the credits, and for  many, even after the credits are done their scroll.",2010
1,"A reckless young climber gets stuck in a canyon. For him to get out requires him to somehow cut off his own arm. And unless you're complete unaware of the story, you already know the sequence of events that will be covered during the runtime of this movie. James Franco does his best with a non existing script and Boyle manages on occasion to give the movie some thrust with his MTV video style direction. But it soon all wears off. There's just not much of story here and watching 90 minutes of something so thin and predictable, just doesn't work. The movie Open Water came to mind. And that is not a good thing.",2011

10,"Danny Boyle has outdone himself this time as well as James Franco in a film which to me is hands down the best film of the year, Oscar contenders get ready to be defeated! From beginning to end the movie has energy, creativity, fun and intense thrills and the best one man show since Cast Away. You get invested in this character and relate to him and feel that you are right there with him with his fight for survival and just a heads up for the squeamish that thing get pretty graphic in some scenes and if you read the book you know what I mean. This movie is so inspirational, moving, intimate and makes you want to live life to the fullest and it shows how precious life is, you'll be thankful to be alive and well. The cinematography is outstanding in this and Danny Boyle deserves an Oscar for best director because this is ten times better than Slumdog Millionaire. Overall this movie is flawless to me because it has an amazing true story, a great performance from James Franco, stunning film-work, never dull,slow or predictable it is masterful work! Highly Recommended!!!",2010
1,"The single point is simply because its based on a true story and for the courage of the man who endured it. The movie portrays the character in a very bad light, from being stupid to arrogant to crazy. 1) He is never in pain. From the fall to the rescue, there's no display of pain at all, just self loathing. 2) The character is extremely arrogant. Humoring his situation and not once feeling the need to cry out to a higher power which in most cases I'm sure most people would do. Maybe he wanted to be politically correct. 3) He has episodes of sexual arousal, I kid you not. He even plays a video and tries to masturbate. 4) Very poor stoy telling. In fact there is no story. Everything tries to stand on the one fact that he is stuck at the canyon. So the reason for all the high points ? Maybe these are all Danny Boyle fans, who won't let him down, no matter what.",2011

I knew much of the story before I watched this film and honestly was a bit queezy as to what might be shown. I'm the sort who does not do well seeing blood and guts and watching this movie was a true test for me. If you are the type of person who gets queezy over stuff like this, I must say view with caution. If you can stomach watching this film, however, you will witness an incredible true story that you will never forget.",2012
1,What a waste of my time. Making a movie about an arrogant a-hole going off on his own to become an even bigger a-hole. How about a movie that doesn't try to convince me of this. Too many fictional events added to make the story more titillating.,2011

3,"I feel compelled to write my first IMDb review after seeing this film in the same week that I also saw the Kings Speech. Both films have a very basic premise that requires some imaginative screenplay to sustain them. Climber falls down ravine but survives after resorting to desperate measures; Man becomes become King unexpectedly and has to overcome speech defect. The results of both dramas are already known before the films were made. So Danny Boyle decides to rework Trainspotting to give his story some legs - man cycling/running across landscape to pumping music,liquid/ drugs travelling down tubes, flashback/hallucinatory images, gross out gore etc etc. We have seen it all before including Shallow Grave . Has DB a lavatorial fetish ? Man dives down excrement filled lavatories in both Trainspotting and Slumdog now he drinks urine and dives into fetid puddle in 127. Throughout, the struggle is trivialised with gimmickry, and the hero evokes no sympathy; now in comparison I even empathise with Joe Simpson in Into the Void ! Yet Kings Speech relies on splendid dialogue, appropriate soundtrack and quality acting with the mild outrage of the f word. The lasting message of 127 is a Health and Safety moral - always tell someone where you are going and make sure you take your Swiss Army Knife. No more than that . An Oscar , I hope not. However none of the above should detract from Aron's bravery, his story deserved more sympathetic treatment.",2011
1,"The summary says it all. There is no arguing this mans determination, grit and human strength; I also have no doubt in my mind that this makes an amazing tale and book. However, there really is only so long you can spin out a guy falling down a hole and getting trapped and it isn't 90 minutes, not by a long shot. It becomes tedious, also you have no sense of love for this character,he comes across as a reckless fool, perhaps they should of built up his character more in the first half and then him have his accident?",2011
2,"Straight up, I am the biggest fan of the 80s action films ever. I loved Commando, Predator, Rambo, Rocky, Die Hard, Kickboxer etc etc etc.",2010
7,So I guess with any film review - it's all about the answers to the important questions. So let's get them out of the way first shall we?,2010
8,"The expectation for this film is obviously very high with one of the best action hero line ups (if not the best) in cinematic history. So I went into this film with a little trepidation and a lot of anticipation. I can honestly say that I was not disappointed. This was a high octane, unbelievably explosive, funny, blood thirsty, proper action movie! This film would not have been out of place in the 80s, but manages to fit into the market of today's cinematic action experience. It is easily much more graphic and gory than most modern day action films, but this adds to the film and creates a degree of realism. Let's face it; if you go around killing people it isn't going to be pretty! This film did what it needed to do, it wasn't afraid to contain blood, guts and violence for the sake of an age restriction but also wasn't overly ridiculous. After all most of the people who will watch this film grew up watching the classic action films of the 80s and 90s and are old enough for a bit of gore.",2010
1,"Bunch of sweaty blokes try to out-macho each other. The heroine is tortured, then dragged through bullets, raging fires and explosions as the whole set is blown up, yet emerges unscathed with perfect hairdo. Pointless appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Missed all opportunities for some decent jokes, and had to repeat an average one just in case we missed it. Unlikeable one-dimensional characters, predictable plot, no twists and not an ounce of suspense. I found nothing to like about this film, and would have walked out if I had woken up. Expendable plot, expendable dialogue, expendable characters ... I could go on interminably, like the film does.",2010
1,"Really. Like many other reviewers, I had high hopes for this movie. I thought it would be in the tradition of Space Cowboys, the old pros come back for one more shot at the bad guys. But it quickly just degraded into typical shoot-em-up crap. Spoiler: The scene with Schwarzenegger is a complete rip-off - about a minute long, no action, has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.",2010
2,This is the worst mainstream big budget movie I've ever seen. ,2010

1,"When I purchased my $9 movie ticket this evening I thought I would be watching an action version of Ocean's 11. Instead, I was subjected to what can only be described as the sequel to ""88 Minutes."" This movie was god awful. I understand that value of this movie is derived from it's action sequences and not the storyline, but even those sucked. Can someone explain to me why 12 armed soldiers play quick feet around two unarmed men and just wait for them to beat them up instead of just pulling the trigger? Also, why does Stallone run like a marionette? Was there a reason Randy Couture felt the need to punch a burning Steve Austin? Lets be honest, the fire was getting the job done.",2010
3,"I have to give fair warning, I didn't like this movie and I am officially sending up the flag of SPOILER ALERT. If anyone holds me responsible for giving away key elements to the movie plot I am legally not liable. On second thought, if you hold me responsible for ruining this film because I am giving away pieces of the plot have no fear, the movie would have ruined itself for you had you simply seen the movie with no idea of what to expect. Please trust me, the book is no better than the film.",2010
1,"Sure, Sylvester Stallone isn't the most bankable star. He's washed up and knows it. I appreciate that he knows, though writing and directing that theory into an incredibly shallow, talentless and pointless movie containing characters with zero depth or chemistry between each other and bringing other D-List stars down with himis just plain wrong.",2010
1,"When i heard about the star cast i thought that the movie will be wonderful. But when i saw it my expectations were badly shattered. Expendables is about group of 5 people who take money to do some daring work. They are handed over with a work by Mr, church(Bruce Willis). The work is to go to an island and kill the general over there. First Sylvester Stallone and Jason statham go there to look at the island. generals daughter helps them see over the place.There they are seen by some people and there is a fighting . We see good action there. and i really liked the action there. But after coming back the old Stallone starts dreaming about generals daughter. And goes back with his friends to rescue her.There after it is a rubbish movie.A person runs amidst thousand bullets , and none touches him. A hero is in trouble, and out of no where his friends come to rescue him. Ultimately the put afire the whole island, and no one gets a single bruise. Even the girl does not come with Stallone. Altogether a mind less action movie, whose action is of the lowest category, which you can only find in Stallone movies.",2010
10,"After nearly a decade of disappointments Stallone shocked the movie world by making a 6th emotionally charged Rocky, he then went on to please fans by taking Rambo into a visceral brutally realistic war movie, now for his hat trick Stallone gave us something old and something new 'The Expendables' the type of movie kids dreamed about the early 90's, what if this guy & that guy and him where all in a film together. A little too late? Hell no! Never has this film been more needed. In a land of watered down PG-13 wire work action movies real action fans where desperate for some real old school action. (Cobra, Commando, Delta Force, Last Boy Scout..) The great thing about this film is even if it didn't have the cast it still would be a great action movie, the fact it has such a jaw dropping cast just makes it all the better. Stallone is growing as an action director, he brought some of his tense brutal techniques from Rambo but was smart enough to go a little old school for other scenes. Their are some very kinetic action sequences but not Parkinson's suffering cameraman techniques like the Bourn films.",2010
8,"""The Expendables"" is without question the most anticipated movie of the summer of 2010. Its cast is a who's who of established action film stars of the previous three decades. Even though the previews gave away the cameo by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it still gave us just another reason to stand in line for this movie.",2010
9,"Get ready to cheer. Be ready to laugh. Be ready to be amazed with wonderful, live action fighting scenes using everything from fists, to blades, to guns. I don't know how this movie avoided being cheesy, but darn it, it did! Mindless explosions? Not really. Excessive? Again, not really. I hate the sort of climax usually seen in an action movie where the pyrotechnics are the show. I want to see the actors/stunt-men doing their thing. I want to see people. I can see fireworks on the Fourth of July. (Though, trust me, there ARE fireworks in this movie, too.) The balancing of this many stars is incredible and pulled off remarkably well. When Sylvester Stallone made his final Rocky movie (Rocky Balboa), he said he did it as a ""thank you"" to the fans. Maybe that was the idea behind this one, too, though I heard a quote from somewhere that after seeing wimpy Tobey Maguire as ""Spiderman"" full of CGI and a stuffed/padded suit, he realized action heroes like himself were, well, expendable.",2010
3,"I must admit that when I first saw trailers for this film I was extremely optimistic. I felt that any movie with such an abundance of action star-power had all the makings of a home run popcorn flick. Although I'm not much a fan of watching the nearly seventy-year old Sylvester Stallone act on screen, I still remained hopeful because of the film being graced with the presence of the ever-talent Mickey Rourke, and extremely exciting fight sequences with Jason Statham. The movie open almost immediately with gun-a-blazing. These scenes were far from impressive and the worst part is that the opening scene defines the film as a whole. One could have simply put this scene on replay for 100 plus minutes and ended up with the same results. A huge criticism about this film that seems almost unanimous by those who have given it a negative review is that there is ""too much testosterone"". Although there is no doubt that testosterone flows through this film like the Nile river, it was not the problem for this film. After watching the film, I realized that it was the perfect equation for how to not make a movie. It was a mixture of bad dialog, bad special effects, and bad acting (except for Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham). The dialog is meaningless through out the entire film and really presents no way for the different characters to connect with the audience. The most disappointing part of the film however was the horrendous special effects, which climax at the end of the film after one of the villains is shot to pieces and then has an enormous, Rambo-esquire knife fly through his chest which really solidified this film as being an overpriced, straight-to-DVD movie.",2010
10,"Wow.. this movie was very good. I have been looking forward to this movie for over a year and it did not disappoint me. Yes the story is not the best. But that's OK because you don't need a 'very' good story line as long as the movie is entertaining as hell. The acting could have been better but its still good acting. This movie has action, funny moments,intense moments, insane violence just anything you want in an action movie! Most Critics are giving this film negative reviews on but this movie is mostly for the fans. Bottom line very good action packed action movie thats brings back the memories of the 80's. Stallone, Statham, Li, Couture, Crews, Lundgren, Austin, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Rourke, the gang is here!",2010
1,"You know when I decided to see this I wanted mindless action and to see how all these old timers cut it in an action Movie still... OK for the second part they cut it quite well, their age didn't really show apart from one ridiculous scene where Sly Stallone tries to run after a plane taking off! His running looked laboured and it didn't look like he would in anyway catch the plane but he did and it looked awful... the rest wasn't so bad most of the action they were involved in was in cars etc so they didn't have to labour too hard. ",2010
1,"The other night I saw The Expendables with great expectation. I saw in trailer that in this movie are playing big actors, big movie stars, and i sad to my self: ""this has to be a good or a very good movie""!... Well it's not! I saw many lame movies a lot of them doesn't worth to be mentioned and commented, but this one is on the top of the list the lamest movie ever.",2010
4,"Sylvester Stallone is a legend, no two options on that! He is one of my favorite stars, I was crazy about him in his 'Rambo' days. As a fan, I expected a lot of entertainment from his latest flick 'The Expendables'. The film stars each and every Action Star, apart from Van Damme and Jackie Chan. It's obvious you'd except outstanding entertainment & bad-ass action from this one, right? Sadly, I got not even half of the entertainment I had expected.",2010
10,Awesome action picture in the line of Rambo 4. This movie is really loud!,2010

1,"What film did the other reviewers watch? The film was hardly worth saying it had a plot, disjointed (like the A Team) and the action was too much shooting...and simply not in the class of production that Rambo was just in. The lighting was bad at times, and seemed cheaply made, and wow did the actors not look young any more.",2010
1,One of the worst films I've seen lately. It was actually painful to watch!,2010
9,"I walked away from the movie, Remember Me, asking myself one question. Did I just see the same movie I have heard several professional movie critics review negatively or indifferently? The first review I read online for Remember Me was that it was trite, predictable, and drawn out. (Bull, I say.) The responses of those around me in the theater today proved those claims false as well. I saw people laughing, gasping, wincing, and weeping. I saw the audience RELATING.",2010
9,I saw Remember Me a an advanced screening on Monday. A few points:,2010
10,"This film, definitely Robert Pattinson's most profound, is not to be taken or experienced lightly. It is a heavy drama that is less about romance than it is about family loss amidst tragedy. It is also the first film to surprise me in a very long time. I had no idea how it would conclude until about three minutes from the ending, which absolutely blew me away.",2010
9,I just saw this movie last night and wanted to take a few before saying anything on it. It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love. All the main characters are seriously flawed and damaged people that because they come together (thanks to the angry Tyler) become better people and find their own reasons to truly live life (something none of them have done in years).,2010
10,"Ummm...I'm not really sure what to say. Very rarely has a film left me utterly speechless.And I've been speechless for the last hour contemplating on what to say... Let me first start out by saying that Remember me is a brilliant film one of the best I've ever seen. A motion picture that feels so real, so genuine you can't help but be engaged. If i was to give anything away about it. It would completely ruin the experience of seeing this film and not knowing whats coming is the films brilliance in delivery. It's a small story about seriously flawed individuals trying to deal with love, loss and life. I'm tempted to spoil it but I won't just know. That if you suffer from any type of depression you should think twice before seeing it. This is a film although ultimately hopeful makes you feel suicidal. Robert Pattinson, Emile DeRavin and cast are brilliant and it is without a doubt the most powerful and jaw dropping film I've seen in quite some time. It's a film that deserves to be seen, a film that should be seen if only to remind us of so many things that we take for granted. A masterpiece.",2010
8,"WARNING: although this review has no spoilers in it, it is important that you go to the movie without any info on it if you can help it. Going to this movie naive, made it work for me.",2010
8,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie and am so glad that I did. From start to finish I was wrapped up in it, getting lost in the characters and the story. I don't think I've ever been so impressed with Robert Pattinson and I'm saying this as someone who isn't exactly a fan of his Twilight work. His acting was raw and impressive and it just reminded me of how much I enjoy his indie movies and all the work he puts in them. But this isn't about him. The movie was phenomenal to the point where I was bawling my eyes out. The ending wasn't at all what I expected. The movie itself blew me away and I found myself tearing up listening to a commercial promoting it on the radio. Definitely see it. Definitely take tissues. Right when you think you have come to accept the history and world around you, this movie reawakens your emotions and makes you feel things that you thoulght you'd come to terms with.",2010
7,"I attended a screening of ""Remember Me"" and thought it was a pretty good movie. I'm a big Rob fan but I'm trying my best to be objective here. I'll say this - if you are a Rob fan it is basically about two hours of heaven. My fan girl self wants to give it 10 stars - but I have to post what my movie fan self would rate it. It was nice to see him in something other than Twilight movies and I think he will surprise some of his naysayers. If you can give or take Rob and are just looking for a good movie to see what I'll say is this - it won't win any awards or anything but it was well acted and the story was interesting and unexpected. ",2010
1,"OK ... I was browsing through the first ten pages of user reviews and all of them were about how great this movie was. I find it my duty to write mine and warn some of the people who might want to see it: it's not that great for anyone. If you are not a huge fan of Twilight / Pattinson, you might not be impressed of his acting: I found it really bad. Then there was the script: the story was not believable, I mean I don't think people in real life would react the way they did in some of the situations. I had the feeling that the writer wanted to get them in certain situations but didn't know how to do that in a natural way, so he exaggerated a lot: in character traits, in reactions, in lines. So instead of relating to them and their sad feelings, I was annoyed by them. I couldn't get their anger, I just felt they were stupid. I was left with absolutely nothing after watching an hour and 20 minutes of this movie - that being the moment I stopped watching. I wasn't even curious of how it ends or whatever happens to them, all I could think of was how I wasted a Friday evening. Maybe younger people (I'm 26) relate better to all this, maybe I've seen too many movies and lived too many situations by now to still be impressed by this.",2010
1,Remember me is 113 minutes of melodramatic tween dribble. This movie is a string of over pretentious scenes that dramatize a very thin plot. Its one pointless over-dramatic scene after another. I cant tell if this was supposed to be a romance story or a 'warts-and-all' view of two grief stricken families. It fails to be either of these.,2010
1,The performances were solid. The production values were flawless. The whole thing was well made. I can see why people like this.,2010
9,"I thought Pattinson gave a beautifully detailed and perceptive performance. His head must be reeling right now, though, from the contradictory reasons the critics found to hate him. He spent most of the movie unshaven, his face bruised, scraped and swollen, his body hidden in shapeless, wrinkled clothes, yet the critics almost to a (jealouse) man, led off with a jibe at Rob's good looks and then continued to snicker. His acting was dismissed as ""wooden"" and ""inexpressive"" or it was ""overwrought and ""melodramatic"". The confrontation scene with his father was his ""finest moment"" or it was ""an embarrassment"". His American accent was derided. Well, what sort of American accent did they want? Wisconsin? Utah? Georgia? He gave us generic well-educated American with a slight Bronx undertone, and it convinced me. The movie was either ""slow and static"" or it ""veered from crisis to crisis"" (One reviewer accused it of both). Its ending was either telegraphed too obviously from the start, or a cynical attempt to shock. My thought: Good script, Fine performances, Excellent movie>",2010
8,"I had low expectations, given the mediocre-to-low reviews given by critics. So I was surprised at how good and affecting this movie was. I really don't get it---it's possible that critics feel like they have to smirk at a Robert Pattinson movie. But he's a good actor, and Emilie Ravin, Pierce Brosnan, and the girl who played Pattinson's little sister were also strong. This actually might be my favorite performance by Pierce Brosnan. Rob's character was a distinct and believable 22-year-old personality, and he and Ravin had great chemistry. And it's always a pleasure to see Chris Cooper, in this case playing Ravin's father.",2010
9,"Knowing a little about the scene for the movie and having avoided reading spoilers, I saw the movie today with some new friends. It was sweet and funny in parts while heartbreaking in others. The movie provoked a conversation about the ending amongst us and we decided that we liked the way it was done. Beyond some minor continuity issues, the movie was definitely worth the price of admission. I will recommend this to other friends and will see it again. Pierce Brosnan was wonderful as the dad. Ruby Jernis is a great young actress. Lena Olin and Chris Cooper were fantastic in their roles. I'd never seen Emilie DeRavin in anything before but she was a joy to watch as Ally. Robert Pattinson managed to be more than just a pretty face and show off his acting talent.",2010
8,"DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS, SYNOPSES, SPOILERS, ETC. BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE!! That being said, I loved it. I'm a hardcore RPattz/Team Edward fan and would probably see anything that had him in it. I had no idea what to expect beforehand other than the fact that it involved a romance.",2010
1,"There ought to be a law against using the tragedy of September 11, 2001 for cheap, manipulative, teen drivel. There, I said it. This film ends with the attacks on 9/11. Now there's absolutely no reason for anyone to waste 2+ hours of their life to watch this derivative piece of crap. This is a badly written, badly directed, and badly acted film. Which is not surprising because when the movie ends you realize that it was only ever conceived as ""an ending"" (9/11) to begin with. The ""movie"" was loosely sorted out later as an afterthought to justify it. It is essentially, an ending in search of a movie... ",2011
2,"When I bought this DVD I had no definitive idea what the story was about, i'd not seen any trailers. From the cover I suspected it was a romance, and as the store was doing buy ten get two free, I picked it up. It sat on the DVD rack for three weeks before I got around to watching it. The film is about 1 hour and 57 minutes long.",2010
2,This is yet another potentially great human drama slaughtered by trying to appeal to so many people it ends up losing any bite. The story is about relationships and how the results of our actions can reverberate in ways that are profound but unpredictable.,2010
3,"To extrapolate it's the story of two young adults with big daddy issues, the reason leading them to be together, is pretty dumb but the main character is obviously dumber to actually follow that plan.",2010
9,"I went to this movie at the suggestion of my girl friend, expecting a chick flick, and was stunned at what I saw. It was a remarkable effort and while occasionally a bit contrived, that was easy to look past. The portrayal of sudden loss, of survivors trying to deal with their feelings, of struggles with identity were magnificent. I was struck by what I felt were strong parallels to JD Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"", certainly not verbatim, but still too strong to be ignored. The middle child whose older brother has died and who has a strong relationship with his younger sister. His questions about his own identity. Even the use of the name Allie. Also the James Dean-type persona of Tyler Hawkins-recalls the movies and literature of an earlier age. Very moving and interesting movie. Additional Note: having now read many of the critics comments, and their dislike of the ending, I would like to quote a line by Tyler Hawkins in the movie: ""It's a metaphor"".",2010
10,"Remember Me is a little indie movie that is amazing.It will make you laugh, think and believe me you will cry. I just hope the word of mouth gets out there how great this little movie truly is. Rob Pattinson is such a great character in this movie and he shows that's he's a lot more than Edward Cullen. I was thinking of him even after the movie ended. He is that good and he gets to you in a way you can't imagine. Even if your not a Rob Pattinson fan, after seeing this movie you will be. Not just him the other actors in this film truly delivers also. The ending will shock you. So don't read any spoilers. I urge everyone to see it and i promise you won't be disappointed.",2010
1,CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!! ,2010
10,"I have just fallen in love with this new delightful show...Ever since her days as the lovable Clarissa Explains it All and Joey's Blossom, I have loved these actors. So glad to see them acting together in a well-written family show. The cultural references add a nice touch, but it's not overdone. The story is relevant to today's audiences, but not in a ridiculous unbelievable way. The sets are lovely, costumes fun and well styled, dialogue witty and smart. It's fresh and fun, sweet and light, and the characters are really likable. Better than almost everything I've seen from the big networks' fall lineup! This should be a must-watch for anyone looking for a great half hour of television!",2010
8,"Melissa and Joey tells the everyday life of young councilwoman Melissa Burke as she becomes legal guardian of her teenage nephew - Ryder - and niece - Lennox; and Joe Longo, a successful businessman who, after falling victim to a scheme and losing everything, becomes Melissa's male nanny, or ""manny"" - much to his own frustration.",2013
9,"I actually look forward to watching ABC Family because of this show,Its nice to see a couple on TV with as much chemistry as Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence. Taylor Spreitler and Nick Robinson add fresh faces and believable characters to an already awesome cast. Love watching the characters develop and come into their own. They actually tackle everyday family issues but without having to revert to terribly fake conversations you often saw characters have in 90's sitcoms. I grew up learning more from Mr. Feeny than I did from most of my teachers until I got to College, this show gives me hope the world will be filled with more Aunt Mel's than Kim Kardashians.",2012
8,"First let me say I love Melissa & Joey. Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence are great in this show and make the whole love/hate relationship funny. The first 2 seasons were great. The first season had 30 episodes and the second had 15. I get that considering Melissa was pregnant and had her baby just before the second season ended. But I digress, the reason I named this review ""What happened?"" is because of the 3rd season. Where is Stephanie? Why isn't there anymore Toledo crisis Mel has to face? Are there new writers or something? The 3rd season is focusing mostly on relationships with Mel and some random guy and Joey with some random girl, even Lennox with too many boyfriends to count. I loved Ryder's gf Holly, too bad she dumped him. Well anyway I miss the other topics rather than fixing or not fixing relationships. Since I am a die-hard Melissa & Joey fan I will still DVR every episode, but they need to get back to roots that made this show great in the beginning.",2013
9,"So I recently watched Melissa and Joey Pilot, and i'll be damned now i am watching season 3 and it is still just so great!!!! I find this show a refreshing comedy that is just adult enough to make you feel justified in watching a show on ABC family, Which again i am surprised about. I find myself cracking up at everything that Burke and Longo do. I have always considered Melissa Hart a funny person and have enjoyed watching most of her previous works. Now in this Comedy she plays a funny ex party girl politician which oddly enough i can believe. It is amazing to see how well Mrs. Hart plays ""Aunt Mel"". I find myself literally rolling on the floor laughing at every little expression and movement that she does because with her it goes beyond just speaking funny jokes. Melissa sells the disdain and smart-ass comments so well. As far as Joey he is just as funny. I think that he plays off Melissa so well that i can actually believe every unsaid thing between them and all the jokes are just that much funnier because of these 2. I would say watch this and be ready to literally die laughing it is an amazing show and i will be watching this show until the end of it which i hope is many years from now!!!",2013
8,"I would actually give this show 7.5,but since IMDb doesn't allow that,I'll go with 8.This show is based on a very peculiar concept: I mean,male nanny who was once a trader but was then hired by a politician to take care of her niece and nephew: who's dad was the reason the man was reduced to what he became? It's an impossible situation.But if you can get past that,it's a good show with some good quality entertainment that hasn't disappointed so far.It has potential, which means we can always look forward to better episodes.It's a light hearted comedy,so i suggest everyone to look at it that way rather than comparing it to other sitcoms or questioning it's plausibility.So if you are ever bored and want a good show to pass your time: You have it!",2013
10,I can definitely say that Melissa & Joey is the most exciting comedy TV series on television at the moment. ,2012
9,This show is one the best shows on TV right now. ,2012
1,"This is a new show for British audiences, and to be honest even my first impression from the trailer was a bad one. Even from the title you can tell, 'Melissa and Joey' WOW how original and imaginative. Anyway, nothing else was on so I wanted to see what it was like. My expectations were wrong, it's much worse than I imagined it would be. I mean surely comedies must include jokes and funny/uncomfortable situations for the characters, I haven't found ONE single joke in any of the episodes I have watched, and its way way WAY too safe, so much so it's like watching somebody's everyday life. It has got to the point now where I watch it hoping that it redeems its self and actually makes me laugh, sadly that is yet to happen.",2014
1,"Very amateurish in both acting and script content. The canned laughter all over these unfunny lines makes the whole thing extremely cringe-worthy. There is no connection between the characters, this makes it very difficult to feel any empathy for the characters. The main plot is contrived and expected, girl doesn't like boy, boy doesn't like girl, awkward situation ensues in which they have to get along and live together. There are a number of specific issues, for example, any time that they are on the telephone, they do not allow enough time for the imagined response. It may sound harsh, but it appears Melissa Joan Hart has forgotten how to act.",2012
1,I've never groaned so much over a television show. I can't believe this sad excuse for a script actually made it to the air.,2012
10,"I started watching this about three days ago and I'm already halfway done with season three. I love this show and have become addicted to it. The show kind of reminded me of full house, and i loved that show so i thought i might as we all give it a try. Im glad I did! From the very first episode i was sucked onto the world of Melissa and Joey. Now, Im not going to spoil it for everyone, but the show was very captivating and exciting. i think its going to be my summer binge watch(even if that's unhealthy). As the show goes on, you will learn to love all the characters, as I did.(Even if that sounds creepy). All in all, I rated this show a ten out of ten because I felt like I could relate to the characters and the story line always kept me on the edge of my seat. Melissa and Joey also had a great sense of humor, and made me laugh, even if I was having a bad day. If you are looking for a show to start obsessively watching, I would definitely recommend Melissa and Joey. I hope you enjoy the show as much as I did.",2016
1,"I was drawn to this show by the alluring trailer but as with most crappy shows all the best parts are in the trailer. The acting is so blindly awkward. I can't stand to watch, as with the newer series of Sabrina the teenage witch, Melissa has lost her knack for acting, at times it's almost painful to watch. As someone else pointed out the only actors with seemingly any talent is the kids, especially 'Lennox'. The cast are rigid with one another and though they're saying 'I love yous' their body language says otherwise. There's no fluidity or believablity. I feel like theirs room for ad-libbing. It's obvious what they want to achieve with this show but their efforts fall short.",2015
1,"awful awful awful!!!! where to begin from. the story is so silly to say the least, so many flaws.... the script writer has run out of ideas before the end of season 1. Why is this TV series still on air is beyond me!!! Melissa and Joey = zero chemistry. the actor who plays Joey,except his obvious hair problem/situation, is so annoying, always doing the same moves,flexing, tongue pressing the inside of his cheek, rubbing hands etc etc etc. Melissa started as an intelligent woman and continued as a blonde bimbo. the kids (nephew and niece) have the most stupid story line. Please take this TV show OFF THE AIR NOW!!!!stop wasting money on this garbage!",2015
1,"This series is absolutely dreadful, I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact I hate this show so much that I am going out of my way to write this review because this filth shouldn't be allowed on television. First of all Melissa Joan Heart should have stopped at her peak, she was cute in 'Sabrina the teenage witch' but after that everything went downhill.",2012
4,"Yet another generic sitcom that for some reason seems to do quite well with audiences even though it doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the format. So what does it do? Well, It brings 2 relatively beloved faces from the world of sitcom together and lets them fall in love so everyone can go ""aaahw"". No wait, there's more to it! You didn't think it was that uninspiring did you? Noooo. See, here's the kicker.. SHE has a busy life while also having to take care of her niece and nephew and HE is the young attractive nanny she hires to help out with that. And what do we have? A formula for success.

1,"This show never makes a joke that is even remotely funny. I feel like I'm watching a show for children. The humor can be seen as 5 children sitting around a table and laughing because they are talking about sh*t. Everyone is trying to be as funny as they can but is failing horribly and it's sad to watch. You don't even get to know the characters before the childish lines of ""humor"" begins, I don't even feel that I'm liking any of them. But seriously, this show should get an reward or something for being the fastest show to be such a shi**y one. Season 1, Episode 1, 4 seconds in it starts with this line, ""Look at You, public servant by day, hottie by night."" and then the audience starts laughing really hard like they are threatened to laugh so they don't get shot.

At the beginning it says ""filmed in front of a live studio audience"" which is absolute trash, unless this audience finds absolutely everything the cast members say hilarious (a laugh track plays after about every sentence). The acting is poor. Very poor. I feel like the only one that can somewhat act is the girl who plays Lennox, but the script is too bad for her to show her full talent. Every single ""joke"" seems to be based on the same thing, which wasn't even funny in the first place. Every time I watch it, I think how was it not cancelled after the first season? I don't want to know anyone that finds this funny, because they are probably as annoying as the awful jokes and acting in this show. Just please, stop making Melissa and Joey, you've tried, you've failed, just admit it, and get this poor excuse for a comedy off my TV!!",2015

5,"I've watched every show Melissa has ever been in, and I've enjoyed all of them. However, so far her character on Melissa and Joey is a little over the top. I think the character needs to be toned down a little, in many different areas. First, Melissa is a beautiful girl. Why cover her face in what appears to be clown make up? Second, the outfits she wears are a little bit too ""Soap Opera."" I've never seen politicians dressed like that in real life. And third, the character is somewhat annoying. She's way too loud, and her lines seem just a little to ""snappy,"" and unnatural. She sounds like how you would expect someone to sound after drinking 4 pots of coffee. I know that none of this is the fault of the actress, because I've seen her other shows, and her characters have all been played really well. I think the show has potential, and I like the storyline so far... Melissa's character (and even Joey's to a degree) just need to be toned down.",2010
8,"Craig (Keir Gilchrist) is depressed. Although his parents (Lauren Graham and Jim Gaffigan) are nice, they are a mildly over-achieving duo who try to gently push their teenage son in a certain direction. This means going to a competitive high school and following a specific curriculum. But, even though Craig is quite intelligent, his stress level is very high and he dreams of ""jumping off a bridge"". One morning, before sunrise, he sneaks out of the house to contemplate his own suicide but ends up going to a hospital emergency room. The teen insists they admit him. They do. However, the adolescent ward is undergoing renovations and doesn't have room for Craig. Instead, he is placed in the adult psych ward, with a nearly catatonic roommate, Muqtada (Bernard White). In short order, Craig wants to go home but his new shrink, Dr. Eden (Viola Davis) says that is impossible, he must remain for five days. Fortunately, he soon makes friends with an affable patient named Bobby (Zach Galifianakis) and casts his eye on a lovely young female Noelle (Emma Roberts), who bears telltale scars on her wrists. These three strike up a friendship, with Bobby schooling Craig on how to ""dress up like an employee"" and leave the ward, at least temporarily! It is quickly evident, however, that Bobby has some dark secrets, as does Noelle, and Muqtada seems to be going nowhere fast. Can Craig get the help he needs, even as he helps others? This is a lovely film which highlights the topic of mental illness in a sensitive, intelligent way. Yes, there are patients with more severe troubles than others but all remain part of the human race, as shown here. The cast is great, with Gilchrist doing a fantastic job as the film's main character. Galifianakis, Roberts, Davis, and especially White, do great work too, as do all of the lesser actors. The setting is fairly limited, as most of the action takes place in the hospital, and the costumes are suitably drab, although Roberts looks very pretty in whatever she wears. Then, too, the script is comically insightful while the direction and camera work are quite nice. All in all, if you are hoping to watch a great film that touches the heart, with depth, view this one kind of soon.",2010
9,"""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" is based on the book of the same title in which Ned Vizzini tells of his experience checking himself into an adult psychiatric ward at the suggestion of a suicide hotline. The film by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck is lighter than their previous two films, ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar"", which deal with drug addiction and an immigrant's experience. Still the issue of teenage suicide is a serious one, even though Vizzini's book, and Boden/Fleck's screenplay, treat it with many comedic moments. Keir Gilchist from ""The United States of Tara"" is nuanced and convincing in the lead role, and is backed up by a strong supporting cast led by Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. If you can remember or relate to what it is to be a teenager under pressure from school, parents, friends, and life in general you will like this movie. It will make you laugh, cry, and be glad to be alive--isn't that what film is all about?",2010
10,"This is one of the most rewarding pictures I've seen in a long time. It's a breath of fresh air from the usual mainstream hokum, mixing black comedy and dry humor with genuine warmth and empathy. It's a movie you don't want to end, but when it does, you kinda want to give it a big hug.",2011

9,"Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden are, in this reviewer's opinion, the best writer / director team working in film today. Both Half Nelson and Sugar (Which made my top 5 for 2008) were good and here they go more mainstream and produce a simple yet vibrant low-fi comedy. If you go expecting the Hangover, a full on comedy, then this might take some adjusting to - it is more than that. It reminded us most of the same vibe Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist had.",2011
10,"The real treat about this movie is the performance from Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. Both of them do a superb job, and left me wanting even more. The entire script is actually funny, and I mean funny as in you will be giggling the entire movie. This movie just makes you feel good, it makes you want to experience life even more. It has a great message, and keeps to the plot of the book a lot better then most adapted screenplays. Going back to the acting performance though, it really is something. While Zach Galifianakis usually plays the oddball in blockbuster comedies, he does a FANTASTIC job being a psych ward patient who is absolutely hilarious. Emma Roberts shocked me, to be honest. I've only seen her in Nancy Drew and a small glimpse in her Tween TV show ""Unfabulous"" in which her acting was borderline on being downright awful. In this movie, she completely breaks out of that role, and jumps into one that the people who aren't the ages of 10-13 and female will actually like! Several times during the movie i honestly didn't believe it was the same girl. She really does a great job. The bottom line is that this movie is great. It's not the best, but it is a movie worth seeing that has a very good story and great acting to complement it. See. This. Movie.",2010

6,"This is a slightly fun movie, but do not expect laughing your guts out. It's a almost a teenage romantic comedy placed in a different environment than the regular college movies. It has good characters and decent casting,and they will grow on you easily. Also, I appreciate such characters that are very enjoyable even if they don;t have more than 2-3 lines, such as Muqtada or Solomon. You may not remember this movie next year, but you might be hearing a friend sayin to you ""get up, Muqtada"" if you don;t want to get up from your bed :). This is a good 2010 movie, with a low budget,low commercial expectations but with great feedback. Despite dealing with depression issues, the atmosphere is positive and delivers a good feel at the end. Nice to see this kind of movies from time to time.",2011
5,"I watched this film out of boredom one evening with high hopes considering my love for coming of age type films. Well after 40 minutes I found myself wondering, ""When is something going to happen?"" I was waiting for something to connect to me emotionally and make me feel for the characters. However, all I received was a boring story that leads to a predictable ending leaving me feeling nothing. Keir Gilchrist was boring in his role, although I don't believe he had a lot to work with. I kept expecting the story to dive more into Zach Galifianakis' character and give the actor a chance to show off his true acting abilities. The film never goes there. It addresses his condition and his relationship with his daughter very lightly, but not enough to make the audience care. In fact, the film fails to make the audience care for any of the characters. Emma Roberts does a fine acting job although the chemistry between her and Keir Gilchrist is non existent (which I don't blame on her). If you are ever looking for time to kill then perhaps you can give this movie a shot, but I wouldn't spend any money on it. I was very disappointed.",2014
4,"I guess i went into this movie with high expectations. As far as the storyline goes, this movie is about an upper-middle class ""Emo"" kid who is depressed because he couldn't get a girl, then he goes to a mental hospital helps people out, figure out his problems and then everything is fine. It's your classic feel good movie, but it lacks realness, I would guess that the writers only connection to psychology was a college course they were required to take. Not only did i detest the writing, I also felt the acting was horrendous, with the exceptions of Zach Galifianakis and Jeremy Davies. I think they spent too much money casting Zach and then ""cheaped"" out on casting for the characters Craig and Noelle. I also felt there was a lack of chemistry with Craig and Noelle, it's like the whole thing was phony. Overall, if you do decide this, go in with low expectations. You'll either find it more enjoying or you'll see where I'm coming from.",2011
9,"This film is putting a picture to the story of when you hear about teens who find themselves in a bout with depression. Most people blow off this idea, wondering why a teenager would ever have any reason to be stressed out to the point of wanting to kill themselves.

2,"Keir Gilchrist is really good actor. His eyes have the mesmerizing ability to look deep and delude us into hanging on as an interesting story is about to develop very soon. The bland emptiness of this formulaic 'teen American movie' with a flotsam of black sink holes is exasperating. There is a phobic aversion from delving anywhere within the orbit of the characters troubled past. With no inkling into how they got committed to a mental hospital - never mind why - how can we ever care what happens to them. For example the Emma Roberts character is just flashed to have self harm issues and we are supposed to be satisfied with that. When the two main characters play a question game, it is just to tease; as no answers are provided. All the movie characters end up as a collection of discarded transparent balloon people going limp as soon as they are half halfheartedly inflated into shape. I never expect a romantic comedy to ask heavy questions about adolescent angst or mental hospitals. But the offhand way the problems and inmates were dismissed is pretty offensive. Yes it is a kind of funny story - 'funny' as in 'ludicrously absurd'.",2015

It took no convincing the group that our time would be better spent watching...jackass. Yes this was that bad. The ending must have been something ground breaking to generate good reviews.

He just didn't give that click to fall in love with the character enough. It made me think, why couldn't they have gotten an older actor playing the teenager? It would be totally different and a lot better since they would have more experience then a teenage actor. ",2015

They were so funny together it was great. The story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film. The only draw back was the length of the movie, they could have trimmed it a bit but overall it's a solid summer comedy. Dare I say this was Will Ferrell's best performance since Anchorman. It's certainly one of those movies you will be quoting with your friends for a long time. The entire theater was laughing throughout the entire thing..Great movie...go check it out.",2010
7,"OK first off I will say that the story was just OK. But that usually happens in comedies. So you have to rely more on the film trying to make the viewer laugh. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy and Mark Wahlberg, then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film. Ferrell really gets to act like himself in this film. I mean he is playing a character, but he gets to use his typical humor. Wahlberg plays a really angry cop and some of the things that come out of his mouth will really get you laughing. I actually laughed more at Wahlberg than Ferrell. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are in the film a bit as the head cops; like a newer Starsky and Hutch. They were entertaining. Eva Mendes plays Ferrell's wife and she is actually entertaining. Then the chief of the police station is played by Michael Keaton. Throughout the movie he kept quoting from the group TLC. He was actually also pretty funny. You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the film. But there are some parts where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be a turn off in a good comedy. There are some great one liners and scenes that will stick in your mind. So a pretty good comedy and I will end by saying, I want to see Mark Mahlberg do more comedic roles, because he is pretty good in them.",2010

9,Yet another underrated movie given only a 6.6 when a minimum should be an 8. This movie will have you laughing throughout the entire movie. I've watched this movie 3 times already and definitely bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. Will Farrel is a genius at finding some way to make everyone laugh as usual and Mark Walburge is just the touch needed to make the dysfunctional team even funnier. I love Sam and Dwayne's(the rock) part in the movie all though I thought they should have gotten a bigger role. Overall a great movie and no complaints by me at all. The casting was perfect also. I hope there's a second movie after this or something similar to this because I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Great comedy.,2011

Try this on for size: Usual Ferrell comedy plus crazy action plus subtle political and economical commentary plus excellent soundtrack. The Other Guys is a surprisingly hilarious and surprisingly action-packed movie that will keep you entertained throughout without actually dumbing you down. Unlike most Will Ferrell movies, you don't have to shut off your brain in this one; you actually have to pay attention because aside from the comedy, there is a complex crime to solve. Adam McKay delivers his best writing and directing performance, while the excellent cast ranging from Ferrell to Wahlberg to Keaton provides plenty of laughs, plenty of one-liners, and plenty of entertaining moments that propel this movie past the slowest of scenes.",2010

I don't know what everyone here is smoking, but has to be good, because this movie was as lame as a day at the doctors office. First, the plot. We've seen it so many times, it's gotten to the point of insanity. Two cops, one the straight edge, the other the wild man are teamed up and miraculously solve a crime that has confounded top investigative for years. Not only is the plot terrible (something about a ponzi scheme looting the NYPD pension fund, *yawn*) boring but this movie commits the cardinal sin of movie comedies: IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY! The jokes get old 5 minutes in. The running gag about how beautiful Will Ferrel's wife is and him not appreciating it wasn't funny the first time, and was even less so the fifth time! The two main characters have zero chemistry, and Mark Wahlberg is really annoying in this movie. The supporting cast tries, but they can't do much with this terrible script. I was hoping Michael Keaton would steal the show as the duo's boss, but it wasn't meant to be.

1,"We went to see The Other Guys following a funeral. We were looking for something funny and uplifting, and had very low expectations of The Other Guys. The Other Guys failed to deliver on any positive level. Let's go through the reasons why. 1. When 2 of your 6 best actors are ""killed off"" in the first 5 minutes, you minimize the number of actors left to carry a movie. 2. When your only funny interaction between actors is between the male lead and the female lead, and it lasts for only 5 minutes of the movie, you minimize the number of laughs your comedy can have. And finally, 3. when you put every single laugh into the trailer, and leave absolutely zero remaining laughs for the other 102 of the 107 minutes of the movie, the audience will not laugh and will look for a way to leave the theater. I personally saw at least 2 separate groups of people leave and never return. My wife asked me numerous times, ""Is this ever going to get funny"". This movie failed on so many levels, with what should have been a great cast. Wahlberg was terrible, Mendes only was on screen for 5 minutes, Michael Keaton was given very little to work with and Ferrell was lost in a pool of ""Huh?"" This movie left me with questions though... why didn't they keep Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock alive, and have them compete against the other guys? Why didn't they have Mendes on screen more? Why didn't they remember to include any laughs in the movie? Questions, all left with no easily found answers.

I laughed MAYBE 4 times throughout this whole dog of a movie. The acting sucked and was forced. The chemistry was non-existent between Will and Mark. The whole movie was so unbelievable and juvenile that you would either have to be drunk, stoned or under 16 years old to think that this film was funny in any way shape or form. I bet that the Rock and Samuel Jackson were grateful that they only had small parts in this movie and were out of it after the first 15 minutes or so. I would have been happy if I were them too, when the script read for them to jump off of a building together and basically commit suicide. They got off lucky by being killed off as soon as they were. I'm just kind of surprised that they didn't survive the jump, seeing as how unbelievably stupid that the rest of this movie was. Do yourselves a favor and pass this dog up.",2011

Maybe this is a cultural thing and people in the states like this type of comedy, in Ireland the whole thing just seemed pathetic. I can't understand how Mark Wahlberg made it to play in a comedy.

4,"""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell has made a mint out of playing morons. He delivers another hilarious performance as a moronic New York Police Department detective in ""Talladega Nights"" director Adam McKay's ""The Other Guys,"" an ambitious but half-baked parody of slam-bang police thrillers. Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed"" co-stars as Ferrell's pugnacious NYPD partner. Unfortunately, Wahlberg displays none of Ferrell's comic genius. Nothing Wahlberg does registers as remotely amusing. He is either screaming at Ferrell out of spite or skewering his partner's masculinity. Wahlberg appears to be channeling Joe Pesci from the Martin Scorsese classics ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Alas, Wahlberg is no Pesci. The funniest thing next to Ferrell is the non-stop ridicule reserved for our hero's red Prius. One cop calls it a 'tampon on wheels.' Surprisingly, the car is far funnier than Wahlberg. McKay and ""Land of the Lost"" scenarist Chris Henchy struggle with little success to combine a formulaic police buddy picture comedy with a complex white-collar crime conspiracy involving a shady investment banker. Think of ""The Other Guys"" as a mediocre ""Police Academy"" wannabe with half of the laughs. Primarily, the humor grows out of the irony that a couple of pencil-pushing desk jockeys replace two loose-cannon celebrity crime busters as the top cops in the Big Apple. The stunt work is terrific. The opening gag where a heroic pair of testosterone-driven cops crash their sports car into a double-decker bus to arrest several shooters for a misdemeanor amount of narcotics is impressive. Alas, McKay and Henchy make some poor narrative choices. First, they kill off the two most charismatic characters, Highsmith and Danson, and then struggle to replace them with two boring morons.",2010

Some others in the theater had a laugh every now and then, but mostly were quiet. The acting was poor and the actors were wasted on the script. The shootouts were asinine, the dialogue was idiotic, and the NYPD are all made out to be two-dimensional morons.

There is never a connection between Ferrell and Wahlberg, neither comedically or as partners on the police force, nor is there a connection with the supporting cast. The entire movie seems disjointed and boring with a few funny parts thrown in to keep you from walking out on the movie. Talladega Nights and Anchorman are two of my all-time favorite movies; however, this movie doesn't even come close. Wait for it to become a discount rental.",2010
2,I can not believe how it is possible that people make a movie with talented actors and still make something that is way below par.,2010

1,"I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. ",2010
5,"It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes. There are some ""Disney moments"" that literally set off a gag reflex as well.",2010
3,"Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.",2010
1,"Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.",2010
1,"Oh...the irony of it. As probably many know, Tim Burton started as an employee of Disney. But his work was considered too frightening and surreal, and soon he was fired. Now this movie marked his return. This alone should tell the story. Face it, we never liked Tim Burton for his amazing skill to write dialogues, for the deep characters he create because (not counting Edward Scissorhand) there were none. We liked him because he was a big kid, with a fascinating, dark, twisted imagination. He had style and creativity. Now the kid is all grown up and became a money-hungry prostitute. Sad and harsh. But true. Sweeney Todd was the first sign and this....this piece of... ",2010
6,"Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for.",2010

1,"I had high expectations for this film, as well as everyone else, but I didn't think it would be another Burton flop. The 3-D was just a last-minute money gimmick; there was nothing jumping out or anything exciting as one would expect with 3-D. On to the movie, it was your typical Burton film, the over-usage of Johnny Depp and Helena Carter, though Alan Rickman is in it, I enjoy his acting, not so much JD or HC's. Also, the way Burton changes the story somewhat bothered me; the Alice-defeating-the-Jabborwocky (misspelled, I know) just ruined the main idea of being in Wonderland, which wasn't even CALLED Wonderland throughout the film. The use of pigs was another thing that caught me by surprise; Burton must've had some of the caterpillar's smoke when he put that part in the film. Tim Burton has disappointment many fans, including myself and I hope that he doesn't create another monstrosity like this, hopefully not Wizard of Oz.",2010

Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope, she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy. And so, Alice in roped back into the world of fantasy/absurdity.",2010
2,"I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'.",2010
4,"I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals, and jaw dropping set pieces, I found the movie to be incredibly dull, flat, and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents, and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue, to a feminine lisp, and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph, the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original, except a lot more Johnny Depp- a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for, but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice (the stone faced, newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned, mildly puzzled, and mildly agitated) flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland, referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters, most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic, and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen (Bonham Carter, slightly overdoing it, but arguably the best actor of the bunch) rules the land, but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister, The White Queen (Hathaway doing an air-headed imitation of, you guessed it, Captain Jack Sparrow). Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candy-something that is visually pleasing, but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big Fish. However, this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars, but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought, but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 4/10",2010
4,"Before getting into any details as to why I left the cinema with confusion and disappointment, I want to start with what I perceive as the best argument why this movie sucks: I saw it at an Sunday afternoon screening, so the cinema was filled with kids at all ages, accompanied by their parents. And during the whole length of the film, I didn't hear a single child laugh or giggle. I didn't laugh myself either, for that matter, but how bad must a children's movie really be if it completely misses its target audience? I mean, it's not like kids have that high standards.",2010
8,Disney presents Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland,2010
1,"What a over-rated, self-indulgent movie. Right from the inclusion of Johnny Deep in a maddening avatar to Helena Carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head, Tim Burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony, in a bad way.",2010
1,"Imagine having no hope for something and it still managing to let you down. It began with a pleasant waltz through a fairytale, as depicted in Disney's rendition of the brilliant satire-laden wonderment: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carrol. It has turned into another epic movie, simply seeking to reach into your pockets, and, with what nostalgia is left since your own childhood, throw the last of your hard earned money at an utter failure in script and creativity, at something that looked as though it couldn't possibly fail this hard (with names such as ""Tim Burton"" and ""Johnny Depp"". Let us understand a few things here:",2010
1,"I was oh so very excited to see Alice in Wonderland. It was my one of my favorite movies growing up. I even went to the theater in my AiW paraphernalia. I like Tim Burton and I like Disney, do I honestly thought that nothing could go wrong. It did.",2010
6,"I saw the trailers for this movie and I knew this movie had potential. Tim Burton was directing, for God's sake! So I went to go see it. It started out okay, although Mia Wasikowska as Alice was very dull. I understood that Alice was always an introverted, pensive character, but that doesn't mean she has to wear a straight face the whole movie. But I can let that one slide. The scenery was terrific, as all Tim Burton movies are. The Queen of Hearts was brilliantly played by Helena Bonham Carter, and I think her performance was the best. The characters Alice met on the way all had personality, but that's when Johnny Depp came along as the Mad Hatter. Johnny Depp gives personality to all of the characters he plays, but this one I think had too much personality. I say that because his makeup is just creepy (creepier than Willy Wonka's) and a little over the top. It honestly made me think of a three-year-old putting on every gloss and powder she could find (and lots of it) so she could be like her mommy. Aside from the makeup, it also sounded as if Mr. Depp kept switching accents from British to Scottish, like he couldn't make up his mind. So I think his character was a little over the top, but I didn't let that ruin the movie for me. After all, there was more to the story. Anne Hathaway came into the picture as the Queen's sister, who was okay in her performance, but came off as a little dazed at points. But for the most part, she did fine. So you're probably asking ""So what made the movie so bad?"" The futterwacking scene (I'm not sure if that's how you spell it). Yes, the scene where Johnny Depp's character, for some reason, just starts to dance in what seemed like break dancing and just wiggling his legs. And if that wasn't bad enough, the music sounded like a mixture of hip hop, Celtic, and renaissance. That whole scene turned my review from an 8/10 to a 6/10 because it just seemed so dorky and Disney-like (remember way back when we used to consider that a good thing?). It was unneeded and made the movie just seem babyish. I honestly am starting to hate the Disney corporation because in most of their movies they have to make someone or something break dance. We have already seen break dancing guinea pigs, pigs, wildebeests, and now Mr. Depp. But, believe it or not, I don't think Tim Burton would deliberately put that in any of his movies. So this movie would be a whole lot better if Mr. Burton steered clear of Disney so his film wouldn't be ""kiddie-fied"". The end finally came and I left with nothing but the dance scene in my mind, just wondering what idiot thought that would be a good idea to put that scene in the movie. Disney needs to stop making things dance disco or break dance and they need to stop making movies about strange animals. And Tim Burton needs to stay away from them because they dilute his talents, along with Mr. Depp's. Other than that, this movie was okay. Not bad or great, just okay. Mr. Burton, I hope you have learned your lesson to stay with Warner Brothers.",2010
1,"And yet again Tim Burton's ego gets in the way as it did with Willy Wonka seriously thinking that he can improve an age old classic by replacing what he refers to as a mere series of events a little girl stumbles through, with a trite paint by numbers good versus evil story a la: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Chronicles of Narnia, Golden Compass. He leaves out the magic of the books, the cutting wit, the Topsy turvy absurdity which make the stories so special and a little girl called Alice who's precocious cleverness is way beyond her years. It is not about stifling a director's artistic vision (which every artist has a right to) or reworking of the story but the mere greed and egotistical ambitiousness with which he went after this project, clearly to fatten his pockets. Poor Lewis Carrol is rolling in his grave.",2010

8,"New cop dramas come out every year or two and most are hit or miss, but there is something to this show that leaves me hoping it gets picked up again for another season. The show follows a group of fresh rookies trying to find their way on the force through mistakes and errors in judgement. It's filmed and set in Toronto, with its share of Canadian actors so that hit home with me. I read a review of this show that was very harsh and was disappointed that the show wasn't accurate in terms of what actual police work is like for rookies in terms of the amount of freedom they have in this show and the ability to make decisions. TV is meant for entertainment so I'm glad they don't have it accurate to a tee. But the emotions, fears, camaraderie, and pain these characters go through while trying to find their bearings in a new career are very real I think and contributes to the strength of the show.",2010

Of course, this is the writing. Unlike so much crap on TV today, the writing and character development has been excellent. These guys really have matured from rookies to (at least) sophomores. What's great is that they haven't been written as knowing it all -- yet. But, am I the only one who sees -- and feels -- that the entire 15th has become a big family, all having each others' backs? I care about these people, and I hope ABC sees fit to renew it to fill in for the soon-to-be-history fall show that fails first.",2010

9,"After watching season 1, all I can I say is that I enjoyed the show a lot. It's fun and interesting without being shallow. The focus is on the characters themselves and the personal relationships between them rather than on the events taking place. This probably makes it refreshing and exciting compared to the multitude of impersonal police and investigation drama series where viewers are only presented with the events as such and are not allowed enough access into the personal dimension of the characters. Each character is unique in their own way although they do share a common trait: humor, whether it is voluntary or not. It seems to be in their nature to treat the 'drama' in the show and in their lives with the necessary, required amount of irony and sarcasm, a fact which makes them funny and pleasant. As policemen, they do their job well, but at the end of the day they prove they are still human by going out for a drink with their friends, thinking about and analyzing the events they have just been a part of and drawing certain conclusions about themselves and life in general. Most of the times they don't allow themselves to take complex situations or difficulties too seriously although they are aware of them and the consequences these have on their lives. The characters are all 'fighters' and no matter the hardships they are faced with, they don't give into them and are prepared to start again the next day. The overall tone of the show is light-hearted but it is welcomed considering the police drama series genre. There is chemistry between the major characters and compatibility between all the characters. I do have to confess that, although at the beginning of the show I thought Andy and Luke would form a better couple than Andy and Sam, my opinion has changed since then. For me it is obvious, at the end of season 1, that Andy and Sam would form a better couple because they share a deeper level of understanding and communication. Sam is closer to Andy than Luke is and the first relates to her better than the last. I think that Andy simply needs more time to understand both of them and accept that Sam is the better option. Maybe as a viewer I would need to know more about Luke's character and to see more of his personal side and history to be able to still support his relationship with Andy. At the same time maybe we, as viewers, aren't really supposed to get a better look at Luke's character precisely because there is nothing more of interest other than the passion for his job. Either way, the fun of it all is also added by the fact that the five major characters are all rookies not only in their profession but also in their personal lives. They don't only need to 'discover' themselves but also those around them. It's going to be interesting to watch the transformations they undergo and the way they 'grow'. I'm anxiously waiting for season 2 to start - whenever that may be ,though I hope it is sooner than later-, and I hope the show not only 'lives up' to season 1 but also surpasses it and my expectations.",2010

This is one of the best kept secrets on TV and seeing that it has been renewed for a 4th season, it may have a following that I don't know about. It's a Canadian show and that something I didn't know at the outset-but it made sense in retrospect.

This show might be old news to a lot of people but personally, I only know a handful of people who have seen this. So let me give a brief synopsis before getting into the review.",2012
8,"I want to take a moment to defend this show, and I will defend it mightily. Yes, there are some unresolved issues that the creators would benefit from paying some attention to. Yes, the show can be much better than it is. Yet, that in itself is kind of inspiring, and certainly enough to keep this show around for more than one season. I would be willing to see a LOT more of it, in fact. It has so much opportunity to address so many issues with its fantastic premise. If it bobbles every once in a while like with the third, so what? It's only four episodes in. Every show's team makes mistakes sometimes. The point is whether or not they learn from their mistakes. The episode that came on after the third was infinitely better than the previous one. The lead characters seem to be having a BALL, always an important aspect of what makes a show watchable. There are a myriad of possibilities left to explore. The lead actors and actresses are excellent and perfectly cast, Mr. Sam whatchamacallit is an excellent handsome lead I promised myself I would not fawn, and Andie is a very compelling character in herself. I would prefer a voice over from her so that her behavior made more sense why be so mean to Sam because of rules that are not under his control? Why can't she just TALK to him about it? Is she actually not interested?. I would also prefer that she be a bit more approachable, and please God, better at her job. Right now she SEEMS every bit the bumbling intern, and is clearly not doing as well as everyone else. Yet that gives her the opportunity to redeem herself. Many shows begin with a much less interesting premise and get less interesting as they go along. This show is better than at least half the shows on television, including those that have somehow like a certain criminal investigation show, anyone? persisted for a good three years longer than they should have with critics' inexplicable approval. This show is fun, it is real, it is a look at a world we have only seen from the rosy point of view of the very best. We have never seen the criminal justice system deeply challenged from the inside, which Andie seems poised to do. We have never seen the rules of engagement actively challenged, which Sam seems poised to do. We have never had any writers tackle the very real problem of special treatment in selecting new candidates for the force and offering promotions. We have never seen people of different races work together and address misunderstandings, like Andie's best friend and her paramour. This is very good television, AND it is very female-friendly television. Men, shut up. This show is not for you. This time, it is not ABOUT you!",2010

I know firsthand that the courtroom drama shows are also very unrealistic, but most trials actually get very boring, and who wants to watch that? For those who are carping about the acting, I wonder which shows you usually watch. With a heck of lot of training and performing under my belt, I'm very impatient with poor acting, but I find these characters very engaging, which is a good sign that the acting chops are there. My suggestion: Either don't watch it, or relax and enjoy it for what it is. I, for one, hope it stays on the air.",2010

Yes, there are moments when I'm yelling at the screen because one of the ""rookies"" completely disregarded all common sense, never mind their training. Truthfully though, these characters are all young (well, compared to me) and I'm perfectly willing to admit that I didn't always show the most common sense when I was that age, so these blunders don't bother me.

The third season did not disappoint me so I went back and bought the 1st season on my kindle since I was having withdrawals from the show now that it's Winter.

I think the writers were really trying to humanize the characters and show that cops don't just pop up being all bad ass and knowing all the stuff they know. This is really more of a training camp for cops from the very start, clearly they know the very basic but the instincts it takes to solid interrogation or street smarts while on the job are just not there so I'm gonna chalk that up to realism of the first few weeks of being on the job.

It is a striving cast who works with with interacting with each others characters in a way of sense. The engagement in the character's moods and tone make it more interesting to watch. Rookie Blue is never a dull moment watching and makes me not want to take my enlisted eyes of the TV screen. They all do their job correctly in the sense of the relationships between the cops and their actions. All of the story lines have my mind into a set of entertainment and the action gets me hooked on the couch wondering how it all is going to match up. Although, officer Mcnally never shows her appreciation as much as she should when someone hands her something, she is a caring gal who strives to make her relationship with Sam work who is a fun and caring guy who is perfect for her.",2015

Normally when there are love triangles I always have a favorite but even with that favorite I realize that maybe the other person might be better for the actual character that has to choose. But not on this show. Luke is great but I just completely feel like the character Andy (who is a girl) needs to be with Sam and am so happy they finally are! I just hope they don't make them break up. Specially if one of them cheats or if they play it out like they aren't working. Because they have built up this relationship which is a great on, better than Bella and Edward in my opinion, I just hope they see it through.",2012

2,"As a city police officer myself I'm always interested in the latest new cop show hoping it will be realistic enough so I can relate to it. This show is not even close to realistic. Police departments are para-military in structure. A rookie would never talk back to another cop. Also, you pretty much NEVER leave your FTO's side. You're slightly scared and are in a learning mode with NO time to try and ""prove"" yourself. Some cop shows get some things right but as I'm writing this review I've been trying to think of something this show got right and I can honestly say besides the fact cops wear uniforms this show got nothing right. However, if you know little or nothing about police work you might enjoy this show.",2010
1,"This is so much rubbish. Totally unrealistic. All these model-looks rookies running around together solving crimes and having soap opera relationships. The cast of this show would be better in Scooby Doo! It makes TJ Hooker look like a gritty docu-drama. Watch Southland instead, it's way better. I haven't seen anything this shallow, pretentious, unreal, undramatic and simply annoying in a long time. The main players have clearly been selected because of their looks, not their acting abilities. The storyline and scripts are just completely contrived and unrealistic. The producers obviously haven't employed the services of anyone who's ever worked in law enforcement, or if they have they blatantly ignored any advice they were given by such persons. It simply beggars belief that in a TV age that has seen the likes of Hill Street Blues and The Wire, any writer or producer can create such garbage as this.",2010

The story lines are predictable and the at times totally unbelievable. Within the first two episodes, Andy has had a gun pulled on her twice and was allowed to go under cover. The acting is sub-par on so many levels, over the top and at times unbearable. I'm so glad I TIVOed it so I could just run through it in about 45 minutes instead of wasting an hour on this show.

9,"In many ways, ""The Fighter"" is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn't surprise me was Mark Wahlberg's signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan's made for TV ""The Substitute"" Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg's strengths and ended up saying ""Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade"" I had Donovan's words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching ""Boogie Nights"". Wahlberg also produced ""Entourage"" and the startling ""In Treatment"". He now produced ""The Fighter"" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won't be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!",2010
8,"After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is ""nothing much"". The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.",2010
9,"When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching ""another boxing film"" can be off-putting. But ""The Fighter"" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.",2010
10,"Such a fully satisfying film is a rarity. A story of family, struggle, and love told with great humor, intelligence and heart. I've already seen it twice and am telling everyone I meet to be sure to catch it. I was blown away by Amy Adams' touching performance in JUNE BUG and by the raw beauty of Melissa Leo's work in FROZEN RIVER, but have been slow to distinguish among the crop of young male stars and directors who deserve to be household names. Christian BALE, MARK WAHLBERG, and David O. RUSSELL are names now branded in my consciousness. This season I've been stunned by the creative forces at work in films including SOCIAL NETWORK and JACK GOES BOATING, but for its overall achievement, this amazing film based on the true story of two boxers from Lowell, Massachusetts earns a championship. It is much more than just a fight film or a biopic though it certainly sweeps us into the drama of the boxing ring and quivers with the diamond gleam of truth. Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity. Russel's team of artists including cinematographer, costume and sound design were all spot on in their respective contributions. Tho Leo and her gaggle of daughters struck me at first as verging on caricature, I quickly saw that they perfectly captured the family culture while providing a delicious comic motif.",2010

10,"This is the film that David O'Russell and the cast and crew have outdone themselves on. the best way to say it is WIcked outstanding.

""the fighter "" does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. ",2010
10,"Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.",2010

I should point that he was someone who had no interest in anything art house . Everything Scott watched had to be either American , feature a big name or feature an action sequence so our tastes weren't very similar . Regardless of this one film Scott felt the need to rave about was THE FIGHTER . I'd seen the trailers and vaguely knew the story of Micky Ward and felt it was going to be clichéd true story bio-pic with embellishment and a happy ending . In other words it was going to be a seen it all before sports movie .",2013

4,"As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.",2011

Wahlberg, who takes centre stage as Irish-American welterweight boxer Mickey Ward, spent four years bulking himself up for the part and learning to fight like a professional fighter. You have to admire his dedication, as his performance and the film itself is surprisingly excellent.

Although the Topher Grace and the ""death row"" inmate have some classic lines also. I just want to add how nice it was to see the Predators doing what they to best again. No more Alien hunting.

There's more to an action movie than the action. There's suspense and build-up. This movie had those. They brought back the music from the first one and kind of modernized it and had scenes and lines similar to the first to try and please the Predator fan. Worked for me. While making this movie, the writers and staff were told to only use the first Predator as a reference which is why it was so similar. I loved the way they brought back Long Tall Sally by Little Richard at the credits. Nice homage to the helicopter scene from the first one. The acting was good and so were the lines, but it could've done without the 30+ F-words. The ending to me was a disappointment, though. So, all in all, really good movie if you're not picky about redone scenes from the original and redone music. 10/10 stars forever and ever!",2010
7,"Just to clear the air, this film is not a reboot or a remake of Predator and its associated follow ups.

1,"After reading the reviews and watching the trailer, I was excited to see the movie. One word...terrible. Have you ever started watching a movie and it didn't start off very good, but you think to yourself, 'Hmmm, I did just pay $10 to see this movie. I'll just stick it out. I'm sure it gets good.' Then as you continue on in the movie the writing gets worse, the music doesn't fit, and the acting is questionable, but again you think, 'Okay. It's been like 45 minutes, i'm sure its gonna get good now. It's really too late to leave. What if I leave and then it gets good. No. No. I'll just stay.' And the movie continues to get worse and worse. By the end you are upset and think, 'Okay this is the end. Please, please redeem yourself. Dazzle me.' Ugh, the ending is god awful. You walk out of the movie theater feeling disgusting for falling for such a sham. Then this supposed 'action' film starts playing this completely random song that sounds like Rockin' Robin by Little Richie... What?! Didn't this battle just happen between human and Predator and now you are playing a Rockin' Robin sound-a-like song? Odd. Cheesy, Cliché, Predictable, and Out of place. They spend more time showing the entire cast come through a door rather than showing them make traps which they out of the blue start talking about. ""They see our traps."" What? What traps? Did you see them make any traps? No, but I did spend 2 minutes watching the entire cast climb through a door. If you start watching the movie and you start getting that feeling like 'Hmmm, this is terrible. Nah, I'm sure it will get good.' I suggest you trust your gut, leave before you reach the half way point, and get your money back. Epic fail.",2010
5,"I went in with average expectations and I was still let down. The Predator's good name has been tarnished over the years by turning what was once a scary monster into a franchise that sells toys to kids. Crossing it over with Alien was a bad idea that resulted in an indescribably awful film in 2004 and, impossibly, an even worse film in 2008. As far as I was concerned the franchise was dead.

I have never been so disappointed in my life, I went into Eclipse expecting a really bad movie like New Moon and it turned out to be much better than I expected. It's the best of the trilogy, even though that's not saying too much. New Moon was very possibly one of the worst movies I had ever seen, it was very poorly written and had God awful characters that are not likable in any way. Twilight, the first film, was so small for what it was trying to do and just wasn't very strong. However, working with a much better director like David Slade who did Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night, he knew not to take the film so seriously and it actually matured quite a bit.",2010

1,"OK, my experience in seeing this movie was particularly excruciating because I was stuck in a theatre of people who kept either groaning, cooing, or yelling advice to the characters on screen at the top of their lungs. But even with that aside, what few other people will be likely to say still deserves to be said: this movie sucked big hairy werewolf balls. Unfortunately, trying to explain why would take up a lot more words than I've managed to cram in, so I can only focus on the main issues. For starters, Bella has become increasingly unlikeable since we saw her last, and as she's the central protagonist around whom all the ensuing events revolve, that's going to be a problem. Originally a great character in the first two films, her appeal here takes such a massive nosedive that, no joke, it actually becomes hard to fathom why exactly everybody around her is risking their lives for her safety. Her constant lack of consideration for certain people (particularly her long-suffering dad) is getting exceedingly grating. There were a number of moments in which I wanted to bite her neck myself just to shut her up. The scene (spoiler) in which she punches Jacob because he kissed her was the last straw for me - I hardly think that that warrants a punch considering that he can't help being in love with her, especially since, deep down, she loves him as well. The little trout deserved to get her hand sprained. But no, he still apologises, and not just for the kiss but for the fact that punching him sprained her hand. How predictable and how pathetic.",2010

All this saga was calculated on 12-15 years old teenager girls, which love to watch Crap like this. ,,OH what a Lovely screenplay, oh my god"" - No, you are wrong, screenplay sucks, it's another romantic movie with special effects and billions of dollars. Like once David Duchovny said in ,,Californicatin"" it's another ,,Twilight Boolsheet""! There are no Vampires, and no such awful Love stories between girl and vampire. if you want to watch movies exactly about Vampires watch ,,From Dusk Till Dawn"", which is billion times better than this crap.",2010
2,"It's just a plain awful movie and there is nothing good about it. The acting is weak, the visual effects are poor (the second one had better production value but the fact still remains that surely that is not a decisive factor in generating an audience), and the story itself is so mild. I'm not even going to harp on the issue that it holds completely untrue to all vampire rulings. There is nothing dark, enchanting, sad, nor even eternally romantic (mostly for femme auds granted) about this telling. Even the chemistry between Edward, Bella, and Jacob is so unapparent. Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson in no way sell that they are eternal arch enemies and Kristen Stewart is so uncharismatic and unable to connect to the character of Bella (I have read the books and they are far better). It's just a weak update on Romeo & Juliet aimed at generating teen female obsession. Anyone who is not a die-hard tween fan, that I've ever spoken too, concurs that they just don't get it.",2010
4,"When ""Twilight"" came out back in 2008 I became immensely curious in the franchise (even though I'd never read the books) due to the overwhelming hype from the fans. After the viewing I felt that the film was left very hollow and weighed down by the sub-standard acting, iffy directing, sloppy editing and overall adolescent melodrama. It felt incomplete but as though it wanted its creators to try harder and become a developed rendition of the books. Regardless, I saw the possibility of potential and found myself interested in seeing where the series would go in the future. ""New Moon"" was released last year and I had actually bubbled up a sense of excitement from watching the trailers. It came off as a new and improved version of the original with a much more interesting story; I couldn't have hit further from the mark if I tried. Completely immersed underneath terrible acting, absolutely sloppy editing, gut-wrenching writing, mediocre directing, god awful story development, empty CGI and a go-nowhere-at-all story only meant to tug at the heart strings of pre-teens, ""New Moon"" was instantly put on the list of worst films I had ever seen in my life. I had become completely turned off by the idea of seeing this franchise grow any further. Alas, my OCD personality refuses to let me start a film series and walk away from it so it was inevitable that I hesitantly saw ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"".",2010

2,"I have never seen such a boring excuse for a movie in a long, long time. Hell, I don't think I've EVER seen such a boring movie. ""Well well"", the sceptics say, ""you hate this movie because you hate the Twilight-phenomenon in general"". No, I don't. I don't hate Twilight just because it is cool to do so, I hate it because it is so mind-numbingly bad! I can't for the love of God understand why anybody would find the ""love"" drama contained in this sclockfest interesting and captivating. The first movie (Twilight) and the second (New Moon) was pure crap, but THIS, this takes the ****** cake! The poor characters (or ""talking cardboard cut-outs"") pukes out one melodramatic line after another, never giving any reason for the audience to relate to them in any way. The ""development"" of the characters are non-existent, they are as uninteresting when the movie begins as they are when it ends; Edward is an emo-creep, Jacob is his usual stiff self and Bella still uses her eternally open mouth as an insect catcher. Just close your damned mouth, will ya?!",2011

2,"I suppose I was naïve to think that this third installment of the Twilight cultural phenomenon would be any better or more interesting than the first two ""films"" in the series. To be honest, I watched this (and read the first three books) out of a sense of pop culture obligation—I do need to stay abreast of the popular trends in YA literature and culture. Sometimes that obligation is enjoyable and rewarding (e.g., the Harry Potter novels and films), and sometimes that obligation is an excruciating act of penance (e.g., any and all things Twilight). What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special? That the only thing worth looking at in this entire film is Taylor Lautner's bare torso? I shudder to think that the final installment of this series will be divided into two films. Please, have mercy and end this entire Twilight fiasco already.",2011
1,"It is indeed a pleasure for all the twilight fans to rush into the theaters when the next chapter of the saga is released. But this one is definitely not worth the wait..... It does not thrill every teenage girl out there. And of course I knew that it is not worth it...' cause I read the story. I watched just because of a lot of persuasions and I did not want to be the only person who did not see this movie among my gang of twilight maniacs. I never spend so much time writing negative reviews about a movie. Twilight was a great movie with a great concept. I just vampire-human love story, that concept. The following series bought up a new vampire-human-werewolf triangle love story. Which was terrible and ugly. I always thought that Stephenie Meyer spoiled it all. As far as I am concerned there is no thrill in it. Many loves this movie cause they love Edward and Jacob. Probably due to their glamor. And definitely there is nothing great about Bella for them both to love.",2011

8,This film surprised me in a good way.,2011
8,"The movie starts out as a generic and even pedestrian romantic comedy and appears to be headed in the typical cliché driven direction but, fortunately, evolves in to something more. Jake Gyllenhaal's character and his alleged ""funny"" fat side kick are established almost purposefully as illustrations of what's wrong with most romantic comedies. It's Anne Hathaway's character that is the catalyst for the transformation from two dimensional rom-com to something deeper and more enjoyable. As she is fleshed out (pun intended because the more Anne Hathaway nudity the better) her character forces both Gyllenhaal's character and the film itself to grow (almost Viagra like). What follows is a deep, sometimes moving and genuinely interesting film. Commentary about battling illness, life and enjoying the moment are all relevant and poignant. Even supporting characters are given moments to shine. Oliver Pratt's drug rep has a wonderful scene delivered over dinner and there's even a smart drunken ramble explaining what is wrong with being a doctor and a commentary on the state of the Hippocratic Oath. From an emotionless and even tedious start, this film surprised me and is worth the price of a ticket.",2010
8,"Like Maggie, I was diagnosed with a degenerative, neurological illness (with no cure or treatment) in my early 30s, and also met my husband around that time. Hathaway's acting (and the script) captures with devastating accuracy the emotions one goes through when confronting a degenerative illness at an early age, particularly when falling in love (i.e. trying to push someone away/set them free before you become a burden on them; stubbornly seeking independence/avoiding vulnerability, though in real life, you really do need someone to love and take care of you; wanting to avoid the grief inherent in your diagnosis, and particularly, wanting to avoid pulling someone ELSE into that grief; going out and seeking support groups, and feeling empowered by this; getting angry at your partner's refusal to accept what is; etc. etc.) ",2010
8,"This is one of those movies that have a weird marketing campaign, the studio wants to sell it like a romantic comedy when its more like a drama with complex and real characters. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyleenhaal have good chemistry on screen and secondary characters help to bring equilibrium to a movie that other way could turn to be a little depressing. I also think that this movie doesn't deserve the R rating just because it deals with sex ( I live in Mexico and here we have something like PG-15)hopefully people don't feel to uncomfortable with the sex scene because it gives more credibility to the story.In the end the film works better than others of its genre and its worth a look ( probably not for a first date) but if you are already on a relationship it will give you something to think and talk about.",2011
6,"Love stories are essentially the same -- it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through ""Love and Other Drugs"" and count the  romance clichés and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well, but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen, the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include  ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""The Blood Diamond"" -- not exactly  romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy's memoir) with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph (""The Interpreter""), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in  a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the ""diseased girl"" archetype, but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's self-esteem  might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of ""she's playing hard to get,"" which is not the  best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing  Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching  these two charm each other and overcome the cliché has a definite  appeal.  The two spend a lot of naked time together, making ""Love and Other  Drugs"" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note,  the drug angle and the ""recent past"" setting give us something else to  chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with  the romance except ""Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that  lacks an effective one."" The thematic ties are not quite there despite  the plot coincidences and the fitting title.  ""Love and Other Drugs"" is hardly the cure for the common romantic  comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes  away those symptoms.  ~Steven C",2010
4,"A disjointed series of scenes, some quite funny; none, not one, poignant – and that in a story about a Parkinson's sufferer. It feels like TV: things happen because they have to happen at a certain time, not because the characters have put them into motion. Thus, Jake must meet Anne, learn about her disease, face her doubt about him, deal with her leaving him, go to rescue her – all this because that's what the story should do. But the scenes between the two of them are just like a well-acted acting class-type escapades, with Jake very good and Anne always a little over the top. They, the scenes, don't add up to anything satisfying.",2010
2,"Hard-partying, emotionally-detached man meets sensitive, artist woman with fatal disease. They fall in love. They fall out of love. Will man come to his senses? Will woman allow herself to feel love despite downhill course of disease? Will the sappy music ever stop? Will we keep watching this dreck? Will attractive people getting undressed and having sex keep our attention? You know all the answers to these questions, as this film is just a rehash of dozens that came before it.",2010
5,"Ladies man Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a super smooth talker working in an appliance store. When he is fired for having sex with a co-worker he is pressured to find a new profession. His brother, a lazy overweight computer geek, has already made a fortune selling computer software to pharmaceutical companies. As such, Jamie uses his charming persona to become a sales representative for a drug company, working to sell drugs to local doctors and GP's. It's a cutthroat business, but he still manages to work his way around people. He meets his match when he meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), a slightly neurotic artist who initially holds him in contempt but then grows to appreciate his fleeting nature. She is only interested in casual sex but slowly Jaime becomes more attached and more concerned about her wellbeing.",2010
9,"I must say that ""Love and Other Drugs"" is clearly one of the better films I've saw in awhile. For a variety of reasons for one the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is in perfect form as the two worked together before(as a couple in ""Brokeback Mountain""). Second it's an emotional story that involves sickness and finding unexpected love. And finally what can I say the film has plenty of passion, lust and hot steamy love scenes so plenty plenty of sex! So aside from those reasons this picture can best be summed up as a kind of old fashioned romance falling in love story that touches your emotions as you feel the couples(Jamie and Maggie)growing pains of trust, sickness and feel good pleasure. Still the sex overshadows those ingredients leaving a happy and feel good side effect for a viewer like me and it helps because I'm a big Anne Hathaway fan and with this picture you get to see plenty of her skin.",2010
1,What was Anne Hathaway thinking? Did she fall for the 'to be taken as a serious actress you have to do lots of tasteless panting sex scenes and flash your bare breasts as often as possible?' She didn't even look particularly comfortable in the sex scenes - it was as if she was imitating an actress from a cheap porn movie.,2011
10,"The first part introduces us to Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal), a good looking schmuck who gets his way around women always, possessing an irrepressible charm that make them all feel weak in their knees.

10,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway deliver inspiring, charismatic and dimensional performances in Edward Zwick's latest directorial venture. The film, like the performances, arcs from shallow objectives and arguably questionable behaviors to capturing the essence of love. It's the classic tale of boy meets girl except as Maggie (Hathaway) puts it, ""...this isn't about connection for you, this isn't even about sex for you. This is about finding and hour or two of relief from the pain of being you, and that's fine with me because all I want's the exact same thing."" Maggie's quote is perhaps the single most foreshadowing moment that will cause their parallel paths to intersect, putting forth a moving story of human compassion and love. Jamie (Gyllenhaal) is intent on becoming the most successful sales rep for the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer. His aspirations are simple; sex, the Viagra account, and getting to Chicago. Maggie's objectives are a bit different. While she too is intent on the escapism she finds in sex, it's subtly presented that her goal is to be an artist - a goal that may be no longer achievable. What transpires is a character arc for each person and the realization that meaningless sex may have led to the ultimate human goals of companionship and love.",2010
10,"The acting of Jake and Anne are excellent portrayals of two characters who each have significant personal issues that prevent them from finding fulfillment in love; that is until they meet each other. The story centers around Jamie's overwhelming desire to hide his insecurity of self worth by being an overachiever in his work and social skills. Whereas Maggie's incurable Parkinson's disease, with it's progressive lifestyle deterioration, causes her to protect herself from those who would pity her or not be able to carry the burden of the support she will ultimately need.",2010

The promiscuous irresponsible guy ('cause men are always like that) and the promiscuous irresponsible girl (she's just that way 'cause she has a broken heart, 'cause women are never like that) played by Gyllenhall and Hathaway are just not convincing. Their respective friends -his loser brother and her gay black friend (sounds familiar?) are just useless for the plot.",2011
4,Here's a recipe to make a romantic comedy about an annoying couple:,2011
3,"To begin with I am a huge fan of Anne Hathaway and her choice of movies lately. But this movie just doesn't seem to fit that description. It took like years for the actual movie to start.Few characters were absolutely useless in the movie.Lots of loose ends.The end was too obvious.Even among the other love flicks, this did not score well at all.Some depth/ content started to come in the movie when they started to talk about Parkinson's disease but that did not happen for more than 5-10 min.Though Anne Hathaway is looking good as always and has acted brilliantly, yet the shallowness of the story and the same routine 'casual fling becomes true love' angle really puts this movie down.",2011
3,"Ed Zwick is a good director with an admirable body of work and Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhall can both act, particularly Hathaway. How did these elements go so wrong? Falsely marketed as a comedy about a viagra salesman and a beautiful woman, the movie is about a charismatic salesman who falls for a woman with a debilitating illness. We've seen it all before. Having worked at a big studio, I could feel the hands of the creative executives and their ""notes"" all over the screenplay: suck us in in the first thirty minutes with laughs and sex and then try to get us to buy into the drama of beautiful woman who is going to live a horrible life. Oh, don't forget that vulgarity is in vogue, so throw in the obese, sophomoric, internet-rich brother, to bring the sophistication level down to the worst Judd Apatow movie and let's throw in a totally unnecessary role for Oliver Platt. This seemed more like the first draft of a novice's screenplay than a professionally crafted effort. The screenplay (and the director) never could figure out where to go next. My biggest problem was that the Gyllenhall character, whose ""arc"" moves form a charming womanizer to a committed man. He was never a jerk or a bad guy and never did or said one thing in the movie that the audience could dislike him for; hence his transformation to a guy who loves a fantastic, beautiful, sexy woman wasn't that big a step or, rather, not an impressive arc. This movie needed a page one rewrite as it moved from rom-com to dramady to expose of big pharma, to vulgar for no reason andfailing to succeed anywhere. No red blooded man will ever complain about seeing Anne Hathaway nude but after a while it seemed like a gimmick--we get the fact that she was sexually liberated. Ten nude scenes didn't make the movie any better.",2011
3,"I have never reviewed a movie before, but I disliked this one enough that I felt the need to express myself. I was really expecting a lot from this one because of my respect for Jake and Anne, but whether it is because they are both so good-looking and successful in real life, or because the production was that bad, I found the whole movie completely unbelievable and I was incredibly disappointed.",2010

Of course, the end isn't really happy, because the girl is terminally ill. Most of the movie is Anne Hathaway showing her nice body. Nothing wrong with her body, but it just screams: ""We know the movie is crap, and we're not even trying to do something about it!"" ",2011

There are characters and events which are totally unnecessary for the plot. The dialogues are an endless repetition of the same ideas and the acting is mediocre. You know what the ending is going to be right from the start. The movie looks like a giant advertisement of Pfizer.

Not only was it not all that exciting and entertaining in the beginning and after in the first place, but when John finally got the letter from Savannah after waiting months (which was when I thought things were finally getting good) it turns out from then on ..nor John or Savannah try to get back in touch with each other after that. It turns out later on when he visits home to see his sick father on his death bed that she did go through with the marriage after all the feelings that were ""supposedly"" floating in the air and all around them. She didn't come to see his father while he was deathly ill, nor to comfort John for all the pain and mental suffering he's been going through with the war and now the only person that he really had all along is dying. And even after his father dies she didn't show up to the funeral. I mean my god.... it seemed where they lived was in a small area how COULD THINGS NOT SPREAD AROUND such things like someone dying? So that didn't even make sense. And then after all the bullshitting around they did when they finally spoke to each other after so long, she gives him a bullshit excuse as to why she dumped him in the first place, and even that didn't make much sense. She said she left him because Tim needed her, and so did his son...and she was lonely and not thinking... lol I'm sorry but if you really care and love someone and think about them every single freaking day then no way in hell can you go through that much torture successfully, unless you're emotionally messed up. She was being selfish and didn't know what she wanted, so let's just put it at that. So then, John takes his father's coin collection and sells it (ok ..good for him) but only to spend the money on Tim's expenses so he can have more time with Savannah lol ...that's about it as far the story itself goes ...we don't really know what happens between John and Savannah after that because the film was done poorly.

7,"I have to admit I wasn't expecting to like this film. I don't hate this type of film, but I had heard mixed feelings on Dear John, there were those who said it was touching and others who said it was too clichéd. Well after been blown away by The Notebook(book and movie), I saw Dear John. After seeing it, I don't think it is as good as The Notebook, but it was surprisingly good in my opinion. The characters are clichéd, and the beginning was a tad too fluffy for my liking, while there are some pacing issues. But while the book is better, having more depth and emotional punch, I was surprised at how touching Dear John actually was. The story is nice and believable enough, and there is some decent scripting. The direction is good too, while the cinematography and scenery are breathtaking and the score beautiful. Channing Tatum(my sister kept raving at how hot he was) and Amanda Seyfried are great and are believable together, while Richard Jenkins is heart breaking as Tatum's autistic father(I immediately sympathised with him as I have real problems with communicating with people and feeling comfortable around people and places I am not familiar with). I also liked the ending, it was ambiguous but also clever and subtle, and I think an improvement over the ending of the book(the book's only weak link). In conclusion, touching and well made, definitely worth a peek. 7/10 Bethany Cox",2010
7,"For starters, i'm not a big critic of movies. And sure, this one wasn't very complex, the characters weren't surprising and there was no big twist at the end--but i thought it was compelling.

It felt real and it really hit home for me, because It felt like true love to me. Some movie buffs might find this movie to be too corny or rather contrived, but I'm a sucker for some good romance, a rare bird as far as guys go. The story was very well done, and held my attention throughout. But what really made the movie for me was the chemistry between Tatum and Seyfried. Channing isn't the world's greatest actor, but he showed a lot of promise here. I also found the war scenes to be quite realistic and well done, even if there wasn't very many. I went into Dear John.

The ""twist"" which I won't mention was where I thought the movie went completely downhill. It was very poorly executed and if you've seen the movie, you'll probably agree. Throughout, the movie was very slow- moving and not very exciting but there were a couple emotional parts!

I didn't think it was going to be one of the best romance movies ever and it definitely wasn't. This movie is definitely for couples. The girls will like it cause they can connect with it.I recommend for everyone to see this film. It is touching, okay acting, and it does stick to the book.

I mean, I know it was trying to build up the characters and establish a good story line, but I was a tad bit uninterested, just because the characters were so plain at the time.

I have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (Tim's and Alan's characters). The movie didn't at all capture John and Savannah's relationship. Maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but I thought it was so dull compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great pick for John,but I had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so I think it was more geared towards them. The ending cuts the whole point of the book out so I was also unhappy with that. I was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. I do feel like I wasted a Friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story I was expecting to see.",2010

Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to reenlist--she wants him to stay home. What will they do? ,2010
4,"This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum",2010
4,"I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in ""Dear John,"" but it was very slow moving; and I felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.",2010
1,"This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not because of the actors but the plot. You have a decent young man who joined the military and turned his life around. He decided to continue to serve after 9/11 even though he really didn't want to do it. Also, it was a stretch to believe that he didn't know that there was a problem with his father.",2012
9,"Just watched this touching drama based on Nicholas Sparks' novel with my movie theatre working friend this afternoon. While I haven't previously seen any movies based on his other books, nor any of director Lasse Hallstrom's other films (other than segments of ABBA videos shown on ""The Midnight Special""), I knew they both had a reputation of doing quiet dramas based on believable situations and characterizations. So I was looking forward to this tale of an Army man named John (Channing Tatum) falling for a college girl named Savannah (Amanda Seyfried). There were also some compelling supporting characters in John's father (Richard Jenkins) and a neighbor friend of Savannah's named Tim (Henry Thomas, who can still deliver years after his breakthrough as Elliott in E.T.). Now, I've only just found out about the changes from the novel but while watching the movie I was emotionally enthralled by the whole thing and, for the most part, I was satisfied by what I saw. Also, how cool was it to see Ms. Seyfried sing and play guitar to her own composition here especially after her recent stint in Mamma Mia! And how dramatic were those battle scenes not to mention the fate of John's father. So for all that, Dear John comes highly recommend.",2010
7,"John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is on leave from the U.S.Army's special forces. It is the summer of 2001 and he has returned to his father (Richard Jenkins) and home on the Carolina coast. On the beach one day, a group of young adults are horsing around and a purse falls in the ocean. It belongs to beautiful Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and she is upset over its loss. Without hesitation, John dives into the water, finds it, and returns it to her. She is happy, although one of her companions, a male with an interest in Savannah, is less than content. Nevertheless, from that moment, the two begin a tentative relationship. John tells Savannah that he will be out of the army in about a year and asks that she wait for him. Although they only share a few kisses, the young couple are in love. However, they part, vowing to write to each other often. Complicating things is the fact that John's dad is autistic, relating poorly to the community, and so is the son of Savannah's attractive neighbor, Tim (Henry Thomas). Savannah communicates well with each of them but John does not. Then, 9/11 occurs and John feels he must re-enlist, knowing his unit needs him. On a very brief leave, Savannah and John spend a few precious hours together. But, then John is gone. What does their future hold? This is, surprisingly, a most lovely film and worthy of praise. A story that could have been melodramatic and trite is, instead, genuinely moving. The cast is quite nice, with Tatum and Seyfried making a fine couple, while Jenkins and Thomas deliver especially notable turns. The scenery, costuming, production values, and Nicholas Sparks' tale are good as well. Most importantly, Hallstrom ""mixes things up"" and uses some very interesting camera shots and scene arrangements to deliver a film of great style. Dear viewer, don't think this is another teen flick with little to offer for the general public. On the contrary, most fans of romantic drama will find it enthralling.",2010
8,"Based on a recommendation I went to see this movie a few hours ago. Have to say it captured the pain of love with someone who is on active duty in the military - commitment, not only to to your loved one but your duty as a serviceman in a time of peril.",2010
10,"Wow loved this movie! Channing was amazing in it. He proves in this movie that he's not just a cute face! This boy can really act, and it was impressive. You are cheering for him the whole time! The scene where he reads a letter to his dad, had every girl in the movies wiping their eyes and sniffing because his performance was so impressive. Amanda was cool in this movie. I personally didn't see what all the fuss was about this chick. Through her actions I got the sense she didn't love Channing's character as much as she claimed to. This was basically Channing Tatum's movie through and through.But, yeah it was wonderful. I'm actually seeing it again today and taking my brother and his friend.",2010
10,"I went to see Dear John just to see if they caught the emotion involved with this sort of thing. Mine occurred in 1969, and it is still sometimes painfully disturbing to me. The film caught the intense youthful attraction, the relationship that can develop in a short period of time before deployment, the love that resists separation, but only for so long, the intense feeling of loyalty for comrades that you've trained with and fought with, the addition of the 9/11 country-at-war component into his decision to reenlist, and the painful solitary existence suffered by a youthful female waiting and living only by letters and consequently driving her to another relationship, despite her love for her soldier. ""Frailty, thy name be woman."" (Shakespeare) As to many of the comments, I can say to the negative ones, I saw the film and disagree. The film was right-on. I don't care ever about comparing a book to a movie. You can't compare apples and oranges. One should judge a film for its making and its cast and acting. The book is the book, and the film is the film. I'll give you an example of the reverse, a bad book made into a classic film. The Graduate is a classic film that broke many Hollywood moulds and was superb as a film. As a book, however, it was cheesy and redundant and, in my opinion, poorly written. So, one should judge a film solely on its merits, not on a comparison to a book. It is not a legitimate judgment, nor does it make for a legitimate review. The only time I would include a book in a review is if the filmmaker leaves out a detail in the film that is included in the book, and it is a necessary component to understand the meaning of the film or the outcome of the film. For example, the ending of 2001 A Space Odyssey, was completely unintelligible to the ordinary viewer if one had not read the book. That was a major flaw that affected one's ability to understand and enjoy the film. This is an example of when the book can be introduced into a film's review. Dear John was a perfectly clear and understandable film. There's one more thing. Some of the male lead's (Channing Tatum's) detractors said in lengthy reviews that his acting was abysmal. I thought he was accurate in his portrayal of a young soldier living with the thought of imminent combat or deployment to a lonely and difficult assignment anywhere in the world. Also, his father stole the joy of life from him, and not intentionally. He, as an actor, portrayed that perfectly. I have never seen nor heard of him before, and I've never seen his prior work, but he was right-on for the character he played. Why do reviewers waste their time comparing films to the book? It is not a legitimate component of a review other than what I mentioned. Please don't waste your time and mine with comments like, ""The book was much better."" Who cares?! Dear John is a very good film.",2010
8,I will start by saying I have never read the book so I'm basing my review solely on the film.,2010
8,"I thought this show would've been one of those cheesy cop shows where they dart around and catch people. But no, my perspective completely change. I love this show and I don't understand why there are only 2 - 3 million views each week. I thought after the 5th episode the whole show would be repetitive but then the writers changed it up a bit, each ending of every episode there's a slight cliffhanger. Well, the main reason why I love watching this is because there is so much tension between Michael and Nikita (they have amazing chemistry on the show :D). Overall, try watching this show without knowing what to expect, because this show is amazingggg!",2011
10,"I'm really surprised at the negativity directed at this new ""Nikita"" simply because it's not the old ""Nikita"". I enjoyed Peta Wilson's Nikita and I enjoyed Maggie Q in this latest version. I think it needs to be taken on it's own merits rather than compared to the original. If your problem is that this is not a frame-by-frame remake of the 1997 version, just Netflix it or buy the DVDs and watch it. (Incidentally, the frame-by-frame remake thing was tried with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and nobody liked it.) Other complaints seem to be about the shows believability, but how does that have anything to do with anything? How believable was ""Lost"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""The Twilight Zone"" or any of hundreds of great shows? You could sit there and pick plot holes in all of them if you were determined not to like them. So forget the old ""Nikita"" for sixty minutes and take this one on it's own merits and I think you'll like it.",2010
7,"I just finished viewing the pilot episode of CW/s ""Nikita"" and here are my thoughts on it.",2010
10,Wow is all I can say.,2011
9,"Well I read the reviews and then started watching the pilot, with low expectations.Rather I found it very good. I really don't get the fact why people start comparing stuffs like this with previous similar ones. I mean the action is good, storyline is great and I couldn't see anyone over-acting. Right from the beginning,the building of characters was next to perfect. Its exactly what a pilot promises to deliver. A great start to a great storyline. I just hope they don't stretch it unnecessarily like few other TV series. Actors chosen are good, suiting the story. I would suggest to give this a try. Will definitely hook you up. Cheers",2010
7,"Maybe not a high intellect show, but lots of action and I like it! I really enjoy seeing Maggie Q's mature and interesting face, which helps make her role as a mentor more believable than if she had some unlined twenty-year-old face.",2010
8,"Nikita, is a different and entertaining new show! I have not seen the original Nikita films or series but I think anyone who bags out this recent edition is being just plain ignorant. I watched the pilot one night when nothing else was on. I came into the show with absolutely no expectations, no idea of the story line and unknown to some of the actors. But I found it as entertaining as ever and if i could give any advice to anyone considering to get into it, that would be ""why not?"". The show isn't for everyone and if we are being quite honest, it's not a highly intellectual series but it get's the heart racing and is great quality stuff. It is a sensational new drama that actually shows the characters in depth. Each episode you learn more about the characters and each episode literally has you at the edge of your seat! I have a thirst for action and spy-type shows and especially hate it when the fights look fake and are too choreographed to even watch. But let me assure you, this show has some classy action moves that will take your breath away and leave you in shock. So hat's off to Nikita. An enjoyable and quality show.",2010
9,"I used to be a fan of the original series and picked up this remake pretty late,only in 2016. So overall i did find it to be much more than i expected. Most of all I find the screenplay impressive and that unlike most American TV shows, the characters and the atmosphere in this one is actually quite believable. What most contributes to this is the characters speaking Russian where it matters....you see, most US shows just leave you to believe that English is the mother tongue for Martians, while this one gets you to believe that Americans actually do speak another language. Whilst it isn't perfect, that contributes to the overall atmosphere of the show and the usual action and suspense. ",2016
10,"I have to say, I saw the adds for it and thought ""woah this is something different"" yet I never watched the first episode. Only on a Thursday night when nothing was on TV did I decide to take a look. And I was impressed. I've continually watched it for 9 weeks afterwards and never fail to miss an episode, if there's a party or disco on on a Thursday night, I won't go. Though I am slightly depressed there are only 2 episodes left of season 1 for me to watch, and I hope that CW pick up from the awesomeness of this show and make a season 2. Maggie Q is a great Nikita, and Shane West is a great Michael, even the little roles such as Jaden, Thom and every other minor has been cast perfectly, and it's a great script. WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2010
9,"I had no idea this series, launched in 2010, even existed until I recently scrolled across it in NF. And now I'm binge-watching the first season and hoping the series continues on until I am old and gray. I saw the original 1990 film when it was released and it remains one of my favorite action films of all time. This series is quite different, but sticks closely enough to the original premise and style, and is treated with enough talent and respect to make the inevitable differences a trivial matter. ",2013
8,"'Nikita' is a fast moving, action packed series that garners glimpses of the back-stories and personalities of pertinent characters. This PG-13 conspiracy thriller surprises, mysteriously holds back, and smoothly slips snippets of dry humor into unexpected moments. Nikita operates from a damaged but determined and focused point of view. This is a strong woman who does not depend on her sexuality, but who is also not averse to pulling it out of her bag of tricks as a means to an end. She will bring these bastions down! She once was one of them, and retains slightly mixed affections towards certain individuals, but that will not stop her quest. Those affections go both ways. Will Michael(her ex-handler), or will he not, turn and aid her in her objective? On the other hand, might one of them kill the other? Alex, embedded within the enemy's lair, is Nikita's loyal cohort, collaborating in the ultimate conspiracy to tear down this gargantuan abuse of government power. Xander Berkeley embodies soul-less evil as Percy, the Director. Furthermore, the lovely psychiatrist, employed by Percy, is also the interrogator/ torturer. Hmmm? The story is just complicated enough to keep it very interesting. This is a new Nikita, not a remake. Watch and enjoy! 10/07/2010",2010
10,I never really new what Nikita was about and when it 1st came out i did'NT really think any think of it but i started to watch it in 2016 and thought i would give it a go and i have to say can't believe that i waited so long this is the great show ever and i don't think any other show will be any good after watching this and I'm in love with the show and don't mind re-watching it again thats how good it is. Can't believe that i didn't watch the show before when it was realised but now i have finished watching all the seasons i really want to watch it again and don't know what to watch after watching Nikita.,2016
8,"After having watched all seasons of Fox's ""24"" series, I began to go through what I jokingly refer to, as ""Jack Bauer Withdraw"", and was DYING to find another action/ drama/crime show to take it's place, but, I soon discovered that anything I found, wasn't quite ""there"". What I was looking for? An ongoing story line, that started in the 1st episode of a season, and was resolved at the conclusion of the season. Unfortunately for me, almost NONE of the shows that were recommended to me, just flat out didn't have an ongoing story behind them : (",2015
10,"I started watching this show when it first came out, because I wanted to hate it. I know that sounds perverse, but I loved the original French La Femme Nikita and everything that's come after has just annoyed me.",2011
10,This is a GREAT show! It is very entertaining and never gets boring. It is underrated and it was not promoted the way it deserved to be. I would have never found out about it if I didn't come across it on Netflix. Disappointed that it ended but glad it ended well. Even more disappointing that such a great show is over and many shows that are not worth watching continue. I definitely recommend this show to everyone. I hope a lot of people discover it and tell others about it so it will never be forgotten. I know I won't ever forget about it as it is one of my favorite shows and that's that I am kind of picky. Good luck to the cast. They did an amazing job!,2013
10,This is one of most rock solid series I have watched for a long time. ,2012
9,"This show is an example of taking an already been done concept, tweaking it a tad to change it but not take away from the original concept, and then go forward with the vision unafraid.",2016
10,"This is actually my first review and I'm personally excited that Nikita will be my ""kick-off"". I just loved it since the first trailer. It looked so stunning. The characters, the actors, the story lines are incredible. I love it how there are so different story lines and characters included in every episode but still the plot is going on so great. I wish I could get more of it and I'm sure I wouldn't get bored of it. I haven't watched any of the other versions or the movie but I'm sure that they can't take the love I have for this series. I'm literally addicted to it, I've watched it more than twice, especially the last season. I was very disappointed to hear that it was canceled. It deserves to get more attention than other really overrated series.",2014
10,"I am simply amazed at the genius of the writers, and the riveting plot lines which are nothing short of brilliant. Add the SUPERB acting by all the main characters, the incredible directing, and you get an addictive adrenaline pumping show that has the feel of a good action movie. ",2012
10,"The girls in this show are outstandingly beautiful... that got me hooked in immediately... then the show turns out to be the best series on TV in 2012... at last, I have something to watch after 24, lost and Prison Break ended.",2012
10,It's like a a good action thriller movie every week - a bit of Luc Besson and Mission Impossible for the small screen.,2012
10,"First I would like to say I am very happy to watch a show where a girl takes the lead not the guy. just saying. Anyways, every time I watch this show I get goosebumps and I'm always excited. All the characters fits perfectly. I love Shane West, he is doing an excellent job being Michael. Every time he plays Michael, I can't help but think of A Walk to Remember. I guess its because they both are alike, tough yet soft on the inside. And Maggie Q. KICK A$$ as Nikita. As for Lyndsy aka Alex, I didn't really like her character at first. But when she got kidnapped and did the whole ""I am Alexander daughter... blah blah."" I couldn't help but smile because her character matured so fast, now its kinda exciting to see how her character plays out. ",2011
8,"I understand that some of you are really against this show being aired, mostly because you've seen the so called original ""La Femme Nikita"". Well... news flash! - the old show is not being replaced, see it as an alternate story - the background may be the same but the writers are taking a slightly different approach this time, so I wouldn't compare those two just yet. Like some of you who just watched the pilot and already discourage people from thinking on their own. Because that's just amateur...",2010
10,"The cast and crew work hard at this show. The CW network should move it to Wednesday or Thursday nights. Friday is not a good time slot, Nikita was originally on Thursday nights and it should have been kept there, it would have boosted ratings up. The CW network seems to do this all the time, changing to a less desirable time slot after the first season or two of a show. I assume this is rating's and advertising related. I love the red L Verdad dress that Maggie wore the first season,,OMG. Everyone loves to compare CW Nikita to the USA Network Nikita of the late 1990s. My take on that comparison is CW Nikita is more like Daniel Craig 007, while USA Nikita was more Roger Moore 007. A great show, ahead of it's time. A bit of Art imitating life with all the recent global event's, hope it is back for a 5th year.",2013
10,"I actually quite enjoy this TV show. It's not your typical cheesy, little kid directed show on Disney. As said before the kids are just ordinary kids, with ordinary problems. They aren't wizards, or pop stars, or actor's on a TV sketch show. It follows a family's everyday life, brought in with a ""suprise"" little baby, 6 month old Charlotte or Charlie for short. It shows both parents working as most families do. It's more realistic and most teens can relate to. And the audience of which it is directed towards is more of the older teenage group, like myself, 17. Instead of ""Hannah Montana"", ""Wizards of Waverly Place"", ""Sonny with a Chance"" or ""JONAS"" which has teenage problems, but more directed at the pre-teen audience who still have a huge imagination. Overall the jokes are quite funny, and there is minimum cheesy moments. All the actors, are amazing. And the youngest, Mia, they put in her situations, that a normal baby would experience. I think this show could go far. It almost relates to ""Full House"" without the corny moments and music. Don't judge because it is Disney, I honestly believe people would enjoy this show, whole families indeed. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the shows that are directed at a younger audience, but sometimes they do get a little corny! :)",2010
10,"I have to say personally, this is the best comedy sitcom I've seen on TV in years. I've been a fan of Seinfeld, Cheers, etc., and haven't really found a show I really liked until GLC. This is a sitcom that TV has been missing for years. It really should be on network TV, but that's not so important these days. It has really good scripts, the characters are great, and I hope this show continues for years to come. It is not only the best show on the Disney Channel, but to me, it's the best sitcom on TV period. I'm glad Disney accepted this show, and also renewed it for a second season. This is a great family sitcom, something both kids and adults can enjoy. I do not understand anyone who wouldn't like this show.",2011
10,"If your looking for a new, funny TV show to watch with your family, DisneyChannel has a winner in Good Luck Charlie. My entire family enjoys this show, from my 40 yr old mom, to my 8 yr old sister, to my 17 yr old sister, to me (thirteen yrs old). The show is about the Duncan family, an average family with two sons: P.J played by Jason Dolley and Gabe played by Bradley Perry and two daughters: baby Charlotte a.k.a Charlie played by Mia Talerico and teenager Teddy played by Bridgit Mendler, and two parents Bob played by Erik Allen Kramer and Amy played Leigh Allyn Baker.It is about the whole family adjusting to life with their new arrival. They are an average-looking, relatable family. The jokes are fresh and funny, and ""awwwww""ing at little Charlie never gets old.",2011
8,"This is really weird. I am a 50 yr old African American male that is in love with show. I like its diversity, not because of the ethnicity of its cast but because of the madness of its characters. They are all so extreme. It is refreshing to see the parents just as crazy as the kids (i.e. the episode where the mom chased the teacher around the school).To me the star is the little girl that plays Charlie. When I first started watching the show it was about a quarter into the 2nd season (in fact it was after the episode Charlie is two on Netflix). So I didn't know about the pilot episode until later. I am amazed at how well the toddler who plays Charlie reacts to her scenes. She smiles and talks on cue. Normally an actor her age is played by twins but the producers of the show took a chance with just one child. Because she is has the presence to pull it of. As she gets older I think the show will be that much better as long as parents remain crazy.",2011
10,"Finally a show that isn't a pain to watch with your kids, but entertains to all ages. ",2010
5,"I find good luck charlie to be a very cute and funny show. The show has a mom(Amy Duncan) a dad(Bob Duncan), and their four kids. There is the oldest son(PJ Duncan)who is dimwitted which makes him hilarious at times, the second child who is their daughter(Teddy Duncan)who is a bit of a goody good, the youngest son(Gabe Duncan) who I find very annoying, and of course the child who the story revolves around, their daughter the youngest of all(Charlie Duncan)who is very cute and very funny! The TV show is very entertaining, but in the movie Good Luck Charlie It's Christmas Amy Duncan reveals that she is pregnant and in my opinion if she has another child it will ruin the point of the show which is CHARLIE.Teddy makes recordings of their lives for the future Charlie to watch which brings you the name of the show, because at the end of every recording she wishes Charlie good luck. So if another baby comes into it will Teddy start recording videos for it. The show will be destroyed if another child comes into it, Good Luck Disney Channel!",2011
8,"I like it so far. I totally agree that it is refreshing to have a show that is just about a family and the funny things in their lives. I agree that it is along the lines of Full House or Step by Step or some other shows that hark back to my teen years. I like the fact that this show is not as over acted as most of the other Disney shows like Wizards or Suite Life or Sonny. The biggest issue I have is that the baby, Charlie, is supposed to be 9 months old, but is obviously more like 2 years old. I mean she is up running around and has hair longer than her oldest brother (played by Jason Dolley who does clueless so well). But, having an 8 month old myself, I can understand how it is easier for the show, an older child can do more and can do it on command, but I don't see why they don't just say the baby is 18 months instead of 9, that I would believe. Bridget Mendler is great as Teddy. I thought she was a huge boon to Wizards and I was quite sad to see her leave, but I guess she couldn't do both. She is very real as a teenage girl trying to be the responsible child in the family, yet still have fun with friends and boys. The casting of the parents is great. I really like the mom. It is possible that I enjoy the show partially because I can relate to her. I really enjoyed the part in the pilot where Charlie dumps a plate of bananas on her own head and later Teddy asks her why they had to have another baby and she answers, ""Because 3 kids was just too easy, 3 is for quitters!"" The one character that is sort of just OK is Gabe the youngest until Charlie came along, who is feeling a bit neglected and jealous. Unfortunately so far he could be lifted out and the show would be just as good, at least from what I have seen so far. The writers really need to put more into him, otherwise he is just filler. I know that Bridget and Jason's characters get more screen time/lines because they are the ones people already like from previous Disney shows, but that is what the draw is, they should still try to make him stand on his own. Only 2 episodes have aired so far, so maybe they will and they are just drawing in an audience.",2010
10,"My son and I have watched this show together over the past four years and I am really sad that it has come to an end. I really like the character of Teddy but I feel that the other characters in this show are sufficiently developed that they could continue the series even though Teddy's character is off to college. They could always bring her back for specials, like Thanksgiving and Christmas episodes. This is one of the few shows for kids that the parents are not constantly playing ""dumb."" The kids are ornery (think Gabe) but not disrespectful to their parents like most shows are now days. I love the interactions between Mrs. Dabney and Gabe, as well as the rest of the family. Ivy and her family are also very unique and entertaining. I would hope that they will bring this show back as it's one of the few family shows that is worth while. It brings a good message to the viewer without being at all preachy. I will miss this show.",2014
10,"This is by far the funniest show on the children's/family channels. There is something to make people of all ages laugh,...over and over. Easily funny enough to be on a major network (i.e. ABC, NBC, CBS, etc.) in prime-time. Well written.",2013
10,"This is one of the best TV Disney sitcoms ever made! It shows a regular family that gets into sometimes crazy situations! And the actors are not all teens , they are all different ages. I definitely recommend this show. This show does not included Wisards or Popstars or anything like that, its a regular family, it almost reminds me of Desperate housewives but a sitcom version for kids. Its not Cheesy or Corny or Sad or Scary, its a comedy, its a little show made for kids that when you watch it , it makes you happy! It isn't only for kids, but for pre-teens too. This is the best Disney sitcom that just kicked Thats So Raven out of the way! Its a very good show with very good actors, Brigit Mendler is great has Teddy and Leigh Allyn Baker is THE BEST for the role of the Mom.",2011
2,"I find it difficult to watch any show with a laugh track, but this one is particularly annoying because the lines proceeding each loud hearty laugh are not even jokes. I guess it is more cost effective for ABC/Disney to hire engineers to insert laugh tracks than hire writers who can write decent material.",2010
4,"Where to start? I am seriously disappointed with the show. Poor role models for kids, especially for teen girls, irritating adults, annoying music and ""laugh track"" recording. The worst part for me was having teenage ""Teddy Duncan"" get back together with her lying, cheating boyfriend. What kind of message does that send to tween girls? Come on, Disney Channel. And one episode had her fantasizing about 3 different boys. Inappropriate! I don't care for her father ""Bob"" either. He comes off as grumpy and arrogant. ""Amy Duncan"" is one of the bright spots for me. Drama queen, diva, but funny. I love the babies, they're awfully cute, especially ""Charlie."" And I like the storyline, big sister making video diaries for little sister. So some bright spots but I'm still disappointed overall.",2013
7,"For a long time now, Disney Channel has been bad. Bad writers, directors, and worst of all, actors. This show manages to defy that rule, and comparatively speaking, is wonderful.",2013
10,"I love Good Luck Charlie. I really think that this is a very funny, very well done family show.",2012
7,"I didn't like good luck Charlie when I first saw it. The intractability of my older brother to always watch Disney made it so it was on. With the writing I was won over! My favorite moment from the show was where PJ has a concert and needs a guitar playing replacement. His dad volunteers and says ""I'm back!"" PJ says, ""it's for just one gig"", ""his dad says, ""for one night only!"". (""Teddy Rebounds"" Season 1). ",2014

9,"I absolutely love this show! The humor is good, the characters are memorable and amazing! I never knew I would see a show like this have this kind of potential. It actually FEELS like a reality TV show, everything just feels so real when you watch it. Teddy, PJ, Charlie, an d all the other characters make the show absolutely entertaining to watch. It's seriously unexplainable of what to say about this show, it AMAZES me. It honestly should've lasted longer.",2016
10,"This show has to be the best show in Disney as well as the funniest. From Season 1 to Season 4 every episode is filled with original humour throughout. It not only makes myself laugh but also my parents and my little siblings, showing that the whole family can watch it. The acting in the show is also excellent unlike other Disney shows where its too vague. Furthermore, the story line in the show makes sense and gives a lesson at the end as well. Also the movies and special episodes it gives are fantastic its as if its already been in the cinema. Overall a fantastic family comedy for all ages that will without a doubt always make everyone love, one of Disney's best up there with other shows that are not in Disney such as Drake and Josh.",2016
9,"Everything about this TV series seems great. The actors are doing their job just fine. The plot is clean, maybe not at its best, but for sure it is fun to watch. I am not sure, but I liked the character of P.J. Duncan. Maybe I am doing a wrong comparison, but this TV show reminds me of the show ''Married with children'. There is the father with a weird job that sucks and he is not very proud of it (Al Bundy). Sometimes when he comes home he wants to tell a story from work. There is a mother whose cooking skills are not that great (Peggy Bundy). There is the bright and smart daughter, Teddy (Bud Bundy), and the son that is... different, P.J. (Kelly Bundy). And the 'pranking the neighbours' part is on Gabe, who is kind of a combination of both. I am not saying I am right, but this really made its place into the good TV series. Maybe they will have a fifth season, but there are very low chances. I really recommend this show!",2016
3,"While the show is obviously a vehicle to push more of Briget Mendler's DisneyRadio music at our kids, it can be funny sometimes. So it's really a shame that most of the episodes seem to revolve around someone in the family telling a lie and getting caught. Dad lies to Mom. Mom lies to Dad. Teddy lies to her mom. PJ lies to his girlfriend. Teddy lies to sneak out to a party and meet boys. Gabe lies... but is refreshingly honest about the fact that he lies and cheats. Teddy tells more lies to get out of trouble for sneaking out to a party. It's funny for a minute but... come on Disney. There's got to be another hackneyed plot device to use once in a while.",2011

2,"I AM female. I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, the general public is judged by Hollywood--the American delivery system. It's not worth the money to see it. If you can get it on DVD for a buck, then judge for yourself.",2010
1,"As a longtime fan of the series I was seriously shocked and appalled that the 4 women that were initially portrayed as intelligent, fun, sexy New Yorkers are shown here as self-obsessed, over- sexed idiots that are not able to travel anywhere without offending the locals and looking ridiculous. The plot of the movie is non-existent. It all looks like a really long compilation of advertorials with not much connection between the scenes. And I am not speaking about the horrible inappropriate styling and the so-old looking women - it would be fine, if they at least were styled and made up properly: Carrie has this weird tan, looks about 10 years older than she actually is and has none of the coolness that made her so likable. Charlotte is losing it and in spite of all the makeup, looks tired and has totally lost her perky personality. Not only Samantha also looks much older than she is thanks to the terrible makeup, but her behavior is erratic and really not consistent with what has been shown in the series. The only one who was more or less OK was Miranda. And don't get me started on the Abu Dhabi stint - the Middle-Eastern country is ridiculed, wrongly portrayed and I frankly think that it is shown in a racist manner. It's a shame, really, that they have taken a social phenomenon and turned it into a shameful mess. I will choose to ignore this movie, pretend I never saw it and keep on watching the series.",2010

2,"Despite having almost not plot line at all. I did chuckle in my seat a few times. That is, until they decided to travel to another country and start offending other cultures in a manner that should be frowned upon. I have no idea how people of middle eastern decent will view this movie. I'd imagine that they would be highly offended as I am. Going to another country to visit and enjoy culture is one thing, going there and not having the slightest respect for their laws and telling them to ""Fuck You!"" while flicking them off because you disagree with their customs is another. I expected a little better for such a well known series. They really showed their true colors on this one. They showed how sensitive they really can be when interpreting middle eastern culture and way of life. Horrible movie.",2010
3,"The popular TV series Sex and the City has ran from 1998 - 2004, spawned a movie adaptation of the series in 2008, and here's the sequel that will most likely bring it to a close in 2010. At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.",2010
1,"I had heard some pretty bad reviews but nevertheless I took my thermos of Cosmo and a girlfriend to see the midnight show. I wanted to like this movie so much but I feel like I didn't have a chance - the girls looked terrible- the clothes looked cheap and badly put together- the camera angle was so unflattering- all the expensive tack they went nuts over was designed by someone who clearly had much more money than taste. And the story, well- what story? What did actually happen? Nada. The husbands (including Smith and excluding Big) looked like they were only in the film because they signed a contract 3 years ago. The ""story"" with Aidan didn't really go anywhere and the 5th ""girl"" NYC was merely in the opening credits. Nothing happened - except for me feeling the same way I do when I see Madonna these days - uncomfortable a bit embarrassed and really glad my mum isn't like that. All the sparkle and the love that used to go into this show was no were to be found. I hope they make enough money with this one tho - so they can make the 3rd movie with all the plots we wanted to see in this one. ",2010
1,"I'm an English person of no religious faith at all, but the way this film treats Islamic culture is so deeply offensive I literally couldn't watch at points. The four characters we have learnt to love over the series are made to be characters I literally despise in this hideously misguided sequel. They come across as ignorant, brash and horrible tourists who flagrantly disregard Islamic modesty laws while on holiday in Abu Dhabi and show little respect or courtesy in a foreign land. The scene where Samantha goes insane and starts throwing condoms at braying men is particularly embarrassing, followed by the girls rescue by a group of women in burkhas who then whip them off to reveal designer clothes beneath. The film doesn't set to dispel any myths about Middle Eastern culture, instead it actively enforces these stereotypes and makes them seem laughable and stupid, and worse encourages them to be disregarded and mocked by Western audiences. We are never given a sense of what Aby Dhabi is actually like; like stupid American tourists the girls spend little time outside of their luxury five star hotel and when they do eventually leave the Moroccan souk they visit couldn't look more like a studio set if it tried. The girls walk around with bare arms and legs as if this would have no repercussions in an Islamic country; the sad reality is this behaviour would see them swamped with lecherous men as happened to my friends during a visit to Morocco.",2010
1,"I feel like I was robbed. This movie was the epitome of bad movie sequels. I cannot believe that the Sex and the City girls would stoop so low to make this film. They must be desperate!

The variety published by a typical paper can usually be solved in less than 5 minutes, or at least that's been my experience with them. The goal for me was to grab an issue of The Kansan, take a seat in class, and have the Sudoku finished before learning was to commence. I didn't have class every day, so when I didn't need the Sudoku I kept the paper. A small pile sits next to me as I type this review. I never got to working a single puzzle after graduating; I found that writing and talking about movies was a more suitable exercise for me. It seems that the worse the movie in question, the more mistakes there are to find. For that reason alone, Sex and the City 2 is a good brain teaser.",2010

1,"I have a challenge for all you faithful IMDb users. Who can count number of times Abu Dhabi is mentioned in Sex and The City 2. I tallied 642. See if anyone else can do better. I wonder how much the Emirates Tourism Board offered the filmmakers for each time this occurred? If you Google ""Sex and The City 2"" and cross-reference the term ""product placement"" you will find over a thousand results. It seems I am not the only one who thought I was watching a 2.5 hour infomercial. Before the movie had begun I'd already suffered a million commercials for the usual chick products: adverts for Chocolate when you're feeling ugly, and adverts for beauty products to fix up the damage done by the chocolate. However, when a movie fades in, I expect the advertising to stop. Brandchannel.com called SATC-2 a ""brandapalooza"". The sequel even beat the first movie's record of 94 brand placements.",2010

I'm embarrassed as a long-time fan to have looked so forward to this film, and instead I feel like I wasted that loyalty on a pretentious and contrived waste of my time. Its very unfortunate that the girls (or NOT) are going out this way. REWRITE PLEASE! In the rewrite, please remember the ""and the city"" part. What group of executives thought it would make a good film to have these women in the UAE? I've been there myself many times and even with that familiarity and ability to relate to the situation, found it an utterly pointless story line and nevermind a scenario to waste most of the film on. Just constant disappointment after the other. Very few highlights (thank goodness for Miranda!) and one semi-fun scene with her and Charlotte getting a bit boozy. Other than that nothing. One part I disagree with other reviewers - don't get DVD. Wait until you can see it free on your cable movie channels!",2010

Where does this vacation take place? Why the only place where girls aren't allowed to show an ounce of skin, speak without permission, and wear burka's: AKA the Middle East.",2011
1,"Had there been a way to give this film a zero, I wouldn't have hesitated whatsoever. This movie, from the terrible beginning to the God awful end, shouldn't even be shown under the guise of a ""film."" First of all, I enjoyed the television show. The comradery is endearing, and all women dream of a perfect life, with perfect friends, lots of money, men that love them, amazing clothes, movie star friends, red carpet premiers, etc etc. SATC has created this dream into a likable series that most women enjoy. Now turning any series into a film is tricky, 30 minute stories every week isn't really in depth story telling. Venturing into this realm the first time was ballsy, but the second time around was simply egotistical. The film contains a various stories, all hoping to appeal to its mostly female audience, #1, Husband and wife fight over the TV, wife wants to go out, husband doesn't. Carrie wants to go to the premier, Big wants to stay in and watch TV, very relatable matter to most women right? #2-Menopause, seen as a chastity belt by someone like Samantha. She is taking any known medical serum hoping to prevent the inevitable. Aiming to guarantee her worn out body the ability to be enjoyed by the other half of Manhattan she hasn't already banged. #3-Not enough time with family, job too time consuming....yes, I know...you are trying to grasp how women with money, maids, and nannies deal with such trying issues, but I haven't told you the final story line...#4-A stay at home, uber wealthy mother with a live in nanny is trying to deal with being a mother!!! Are you on the floor? That one should've put you right over the edge. So, here we are, four extremely wealthy women, dealing with problems that you and I deal with every day. Except they have live in nannies, drivers, extra homes to hang out at when they want to ""get away,"" closets full of couture, and oh yeah, did I mention they're millionaires? So how much crazier can this story get you ask, well here it is, the writers/directors decided to throw these women into a culture that is the total opposite of everything they stand for-THE MIDDLE EAST..(gasp, hand over mouth, tears streaming down your horrified face). So they send these spoiled sluts on over to the Middle East, now this is where the story literally takes a nose dive into the Red Sea. The writers/directors thought it would be humorous to have these women confronted with a culture so unlike their own, and then have them mock it, very ignorantly I might add. If there is ever the stereotypical view that Americans are stupid and ignorant to foreign cultures, that assumption would have been reached upon viewing this film. The SATC sluts dress provocatively, then mock the local women for choosing a life of piousness to one of shallow days filled with shopping. The culminating shot was Samantha's purse being spilled onto the streets of a marketplace and her stack of condoms falling out. She then screams into the crowd that yes, she likes to have sex, all while gyrating her hips and pumping her fists. Are we to assume that the writer/directors were hoping that you would side with Samantha? Hooray for America, for women having sex, wearing whatever they want and being proud of it? Not that there is anything wrong with that, but they are placing the Muslim lifestyle under the DON'T column of this list. Upon picking up her stack of condoms, the women are helped by a group of Muslim women that take them to a back room and pull of there niqab's to reveal they are all dressed to the nines like the SATC ladies!! Hooray, this culture of women dressed so terribly, but underneath, they want to be just like us Americans. Heartwarming right? Well it's not, it is terribly arrogant and embarrassing. I feel there is always something good that comes from most movies, good looking guys/girls, cool clothes (btw-the women were all dressed terribly in SATC2), some humorous dialogue, but this movie has nothing. If there is a God, then this movie will surely end up in hell.",2011

1,"I guess that this is what happens after the prince and Cinderella shut the castle gates - happily ever after (not). The problem is that Cinderella (Carrie) is a spoiled little madam, not only did she blame Big for everything that went wrong during their courtship and then the disastrous wedding for which she was to blame - they had agreed on a quiet wedding and she went ballistic with Vogue and a Vivienne Westwood gown - but then, after two years of living in paradise with a gorgeous man who adores her and lavishes all he can on her in the way of worldly goods and attention, she has a tantrum because he is selfish enough to buy her a state of the art TV for their bedroom so that, after a day's graft of earning the money to keep her in luxury, he can relax. How dare he! Switch then to another storyline with Samantha, who hit 50 in the last film, so technically should be through menopause by now, but no, is taking every pill and lotion under the sky to ward off symptoms and acting like an out of control pantomime dame, and Miranda who has a new boss who doesn't like her, and of course Charlotte, whose children have a nanny who doesn't wear a bra but who loves to draw attention to that fact - well of course, all meaningful crises in the normal world, but we are talking megabucks city here guys. Then by some chance they are whisked away to the United Arab Emirates, to Abu Dahbi, where the luxury is excessive even to one who dreams of winning lotto. There, bare skinned and offensively dressed and behaving badly they proceed to upset the locals and get kicked out, after Carrie has met up with old flame Aiden and kissed him and phoned Big to blurt out the truth - why not wait until you can do this humanely, face to face if you have to tell him, and if it meant nothing, why torment the poor chap? They arrive home, having learned that of course all Arab women wear NY fashions under their black costumes and read trashy NY books. Big's punishment for Carrie is to give her a massive diamond. Embarrassing to see Samantha, (my favourite) become a joke; sad to see Miranda, (my second favourite) and Charlotte so petty, and sad to see that Carrie (sorry but always watched despite her, not because of her) has not grown up yet and is still childish, sulky, spoiled and ridiculous. A real disappointment. Quit while you can girls...",2010

She's cute and great to look at but it's really her quirky humour and craziness that delights! Bo is a good lead character and she doesn't seem to overdo the sexiness thing, being a succubus and all - but it's Kenzi that rules. Lauren, the scientist 'girlfriend' that Bo is getting more and more involved with is a bit wet but overall the series was great. Full of fantastic characters and 'faerie' creatures. I was willing to give Lost Girl a chance. Sadly, it has since all has gone downhill bit by bit and my interest has has now waned. It all began to get a bit samey.

10,I just read Rob Partridge (Ireland) review here and am i ever so glad i donot go by what critics or people say about TV shows or movies and i just judge it myself. Everyone are entitled to their own opinions but this guy sure has no clue. Because the show kicks a&& and i am not the only one who thinks so. I happen to love the way the actors play their roles every single one of them. Every time i watch an episode i go nuts waiting for the next. I love every single part of the show and so do a whole lot of my friends and we donot get showcase so we have to settle to view it online. I heard it might get to be shown on USA TV so i sure hope so! Anyways i give it a big 10+ and hope that it goes on for a long time and as soon as it hits DVD its mine!!!!,2010

10,OK so this is the first time that I've thought a show was good enough to write a review. its different its deep its SEXY. Anna silk does a great job at portraying Bo with her subtle seriousness and worried soul. hilarious sidekick that adds so much humour to every situation. the people writing this show are genius. its got a natural feel to the show and all the cast do a great job adding depth. not like shows i have noticed recently such as sanctuary and warehouse13 where the characters are not believable and are rushed with no character development and offering nothing new to us sci-fi fans other than cheap regurgitated Buffy and x-file episodes.,2011
8,"When I first heard the premise for SyFy's new show, Lost Girl, I greeted it with a big yawn. Luckily for me, my roommate recorded the pilot. She knows my taste in movies/TV and she insisted that I watch it. I didn't right away, but I did set the DVR to record the series. Last week, I finally started watching the first 7 episodes. I was blown away! First, I can't take my eyes off of Anna Silk. She is stunning. Then the sexuality that's central to the story - outstanding and artfully done. I like the concept. It reminds me of the Easy Rawlins mystery series. Like Rawlins, Bo can move between worlds in a way that others can't and so she is the perfect private investigator for those cases that require a unique approach. I hope this series gets picked up for more seasons. It's great fun!",2012
10,"I really do not understand what is with these bad reviews. Lost Girl is so entertaining! Isn't that what TV is about? Entertainment??

And you just KNOW her and Dyson are going to end up together, just as soon as he owns up to his feelings. And the potential Bo has to completely ruin the way the Fae are owned by light or dark??

I hope they make MANY more seasons because I will be super sad when it's over. The show is well written, it's hard for me to actually choose a favorite character, starting with the second season it will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. All the actors seem to work so well together and the settings are pretty cool as well. It doesn't have the old cheesy special effects of say Charmed either, everything looks real and is believable. The writers on the show are doing a very good job,and I really really hope they keep renewing the seasons because I think if enough people happen to watch it, it will be one of the big shows like Charmed was.",2016

4,"Lost Girl started out with an interesting premise: superimpose the macro level struggle between various groups of light ""faes"" and dark ""faes"" and their human ""inferiors"", against the micro struggle of one unaligned, newly aware Succubus. The tensions that were presented while the characters' back stories were revealed (along with the racy bi-sexual themes explored week after week) definitely drew in this viewer. And for a while, the weekly introduction of various mythical creatures, along with some twisty character development, provided ample amounts of interest, intrigue, and titillation. However, as often happens with shows that try to be a little too cutting edge, the edge slowly dulled, and the stories lost their punch, and even worse – their relevance.",2013
4,"As a fan of mythology, I adore any show involving the supernatural in modern times. However, Lost Girl is very confused on what it wants to be. Is it a show that just wants to get HBO's attention with its gratuitous sex scenes and stages of undress for the heroines? Is it a genuine grim and gritty update to Charmed or Buffy? Is it a half-baked comedy that features sex jokes as the mainstay of humor? The answer is, it tries to be all of the above and fails at all of them. The first season is OK, with a few nitpicks about the names of the mythological creatures. The second season gets worse with a few more visible issues though and dumb character life-decisions and development. IE, more HBO-wannabe sex scenes for the sake of sex scenes, characters that have outlived their purposes and flat character development. Bo stops being just a competent heroine and becomes an unstoppable Mary Sue that suffers no negative repercussions for her actions and can even take down the leader of the Dark Fae with no effort who I think would be a tad more resistant her orgasm powers.",2013

I was hoping to continue watching this but I just couldn't because it was so badly written and force thing for you to believe , kind of make me feel like the writer is a rookie and he is just gathering some magick books and basing his stories about, if this story was given to a good writer it could have been really more promising but alas ...

I don't understand the target audience for this series ... should it be some sci-fi bunch or some women that confuse feminism with self-centered views of the world and easiness, confusing independence but never relying just on them (you get the picture). I don't mind the original plot based on white and dark but the main character is just wrong and is extremely shallow. I understand that this type of persons really exist in real life but why would you make a serial about it. Weirder it is the fact that better serials are canceled and this is still ongoing. Anyhow i will end my review with the summary ""A series about a ""easy"" girl with some superpowers"". Le end.",2012

8,"Overkill is underrated. One of the many mottoes Colonel John Hannibal Smith throws around whilst hatching his brilliant plans, dispensing them like his insightful wisdom increases the chances of success. A motto director Joe Carnahan has taken to heart in making 'The A-Team'. A smart move, as complete and uncompromising exaggeration appears to be exactly what the format asked for. Especially since the translation of TV shows to the big screen has proved to be no easy task. Just look at 'Miami Vice', which pretty much bombed despite the presence of Michael Mann, the director/producer who created the original series. Or the near criminal trashing überhobbyist MacGuyver recently received by the hands of questionable farce 'MacGruber'. In a world so significantly different from the mid-eighties, the severely underpaid and hopelessly dated missions of the four fugitives could have very much been out of place as well. ",2010

8,"I remember first hearing about this. Cautious optimism was among my immediate reactions. Later, I caught a trailer(on that, do not think for a second that you saw all the good stuff, there's plenty they didn't give away). I was still not sure what to think. Then I watched it tonight. I enjoyed every single frame. No, I'm not kidding, this works from the very start and never loses you. I love the show, and this pays a lot of respect to it(at times, a tad much... early on, Neeson's every other line contains the word ""plan""), and this not only nails the four characters(who all get an unforgettable introduction each, and several individual heroic moments), it doesn't merely imitate, but builds and slightly reinterprets to update them. They are played rather well; Liam looks like he was born with that cigar in his mouth, Bradley genuinely is charming and suave, Sharlto(from District 9; he reverts to his dialect here and there) comes across as a lunatic without that making us dislike him, and Jackson... well, he looks cool, he's not asked to do anything he can't handle, and he's certainly got more charisma than any other wrestlers on the silver screen(or Vin Diesel). The acting is in general marvelous, and every role is well-cast. Everybody is a bad-ass in this(on/off at least), and that does get old every now and then. Biel is largely eye-candy(as is all other females in this), though we know that she can do this kind of thing, and she doesn't let us down. The dialog wants to be as clever and full of banter as 2008's Iron Man, and this leads to it trying too hard some(with that said, two thirds of it works perfectly, and it's not a complete buzz-kill when it doesn't). It is hilarious a lot of the time, and the half-full theater I was in all clearly got a kick out of it. This is two hours of pure fun with non-stop, awesome action that doesn't repeat itself, with shoot-outs, chases and fights. It's not realistic, and it's not meant to be. The plans are *brilliant* and seeing them gather materials for them is a blast. This keeps to an immensely fast pace, without overwhelming us, and it fits in plenty of well-thought out plot(that doesn't confuse, in spite of twists and such, that hold up). The script is by the guy who did Wolverine, Swordfish and Hit-man and a rookie; however, maybe because of help from the director(who I've only seen one other thing by, his outstanding The Hire short), they turn in something magnificent. FX are plentiful(occasionally overshadowing the people... be careful, Carnahan), and excellent with a few brief poor bits. The editing is tight, cinematography stylish. While it's black and white, switch-off-your-brain-at-the-door, Hollywood popcorn flick, it doesn't claim or attempt to be anything else, and it's an utterly well-made and re-watchable one at that. There is a little strong language and brutality to the violence in this(no blood). I recommend this to fans of the television series who don't have impossible-to-reach expectations, and everyone who can get into a movie that just entertains you for a solid 120 minutes. 8/10",2010

You have no sense that anyone is ever in danger, everyone is a comedian, the US Army is bunch of people who have no idea what anyone else is doing and rank is a non factor. This is a movie made for a 13 year old who has the attention span of a gnat. Two hours of non stop BS wrapped in a ludicrous plot. I hated the A-Team TV show because it was so silly and I was a teen at the time, this garbage makes that look like Shakespeare. This is the most overwhelmingly bad movie in a decade.

1,This was one of the worst movies that I've seen in years. I like action movies and usually have no problem with mindless plots and violence but this movie made Steven Seagal movies look Oscar worthy. The actors were fine and there were plenty of funny one liners. The plot was nothing special but I can accept that. The problem was that the movie was carried out with such a lack of cohesion that everything just fell to crap. I just did not give a damn what happened in the movie after the first 30 minutes and to tell the truth I just wanted it to end. My advice is to save your money and more importantly to save your time. Remember this is your life and you can never get those hours back.,2010

The A Team --- watch out for the best action flick -- Q.R.Jackson still remains the Man of the movie :) can give 9 for the action and 10 for the style. well this movie kinda started without any great events as every movie would have however when it gradually picked up, thriller entered the movie and there it went on. there was some scene which really made every one laugh though it was still a thriller and action flick. Awesome acting by all the four hero's and good supporting role for the villain. i was actually wondering how would they end the story as in all the movies where at the end of the movie we would have the bad boys caught but it had good real turns:) thanks to the director for giving such a good flick :) cheers for The A Team.",2010
2,"It wasn't until I saw A-Team that I realized I never bothered to actually define what a movie is. So I went to Merram Webster online and found this: ""a sequence of consecutive pictures of objects photographed in motion by a specially designed camera (motion-picture camera) and thrown on a screen by a projector (motion-picture projector) in such rapid succession as to give the illusion of natural movement."" That was a perfect definition and exactly what I felt about A-Team. It was nothing but that. Someone threw images on a screen. There was sound, color, plenty of sensation and exaggeration, absurdity and nonsense. Amid all this I found several delightful performers who had the misfortune of having to portray characters who were forced to fit into a mess of ""tossed-salad editing"". I really did like the characters. But they could not rise above the crap all around them. Character development was horrible, story development was horrible, and having to change focus on highspeed mood shifts and plot shifts just became way too much of an intrusion on my intelligence. Sorry, I am not going to allow myself to give this trash any respect if I cannot get it from people who don't know how to make movies.",2010

I know there is a lot of expectation when a famous and much loved TV show is adapted into a two hour feature film. Especially when it is 25 years later. But how Joe Carnahan turned it into (to borrow a quote from Roger Ebert) an incomprehensible mess, I'll never know. Forget the lame script, there is much bigger bones to pick. I don't even know where to start so in no particular order: Music. Apart from a few chords here and there, where the hell was the theme music? (Apart from the credits). BA's GMC had a cameo then got smashed to bits? Casting: Liam Neeson as Hannibal. Great. No problems. Bradley Cooper as Face. Great. No problems. Quinten ""Rampage"" Jackson. Mixed.

Half of Hollywood's A List star as vacuous stereotypes, moronically obsessed with the holiday in question. This despite the fact they are all living millionaire lifestyles, with perfect tans and the whitest of teeth. It's Love Actually, without a sense of humour or any depth whatsoever. No- one and nothing is remotely realistic - every storyline has a trite and convenient resolution and none is convincing or interesting. There is a perfect and unlikely ratio of ethnicities and sexualities. The sex trade is entirely trivialised and sanitised. No-one stays upset about relationship breakdowns for more than one scene. People break into spontaneous dance sequences in which everyone knows the pre-rehearsed moves but the film doesn't have the conviction to show it for more than 3 seconds... Just utter pointless and patronising bilge...",2010
3,"Did you read that cast list? Gives the term 'star-studded' a new meaning. Imagine what kind of film you could make with all that talent. Well, Valentine's Day is not that film. Far from it in fact. This who's who of a cast hampers any chance of real emotion due to the need to share screen time among them all. When you start getting interested in a character you'll most likely not see them again for another 45 minutes, pretty annoying when there are so few likable characters in the first place.",2010

After watching the film you'll find yourself counting how many of the stars and starlets on the poster were even necessary in the film and start realising that the number of 'name' actors in the film is directly proportionate to the number of dollars it cost you for the ticket. Had they dropped 8 of the major players out and actually investigated the remaining stories a little further, rather than jumping back and forward between around a dozen limp ones, it may have been two dollars well spent. Don't waste your money - $12 will buy cheap roses from the petrol station and will probably be a more memorable gift to your significant other.",2010

Well, they did. This movie had me feeling for, well, MOST of the main characters. Ashton Kutcher was very good in this movie, he also had one of the bigger roles and he pulled it off really well. The others were mostly good too, Taylor Swift's character was kind of annoying, but I think she was supposed to be. The story had me intrigued from beginning to end, seeing how all the different characters were connected and the chemistry between each couple was very believable also. If you watch this with your partner, it will make you feel closer. If you watch this without your partner, it will make you miss them.

9,"If you are a fan of animated movies, then this year is one of the best years of your life. ""Despicable Me"" is a movie that you can watch all over again without getting tired of it. It has many laughs, and memorable characters. The only problem of this movie is that the story is just simple but what makes this movie great besides the laughs is the heart. It is cute, entertaining, and amusing. Non-Pixar animated studios has finally know how to make a great animated movie.",2010
8,"Living up to the advertising buzz DESPICABLE ME is absolutely a hoot. Steve Carell voices Gru, a bumbling egotistical villain with life long plans of stealing the moon. Gru's personal weapons specialist Dr. Nefario(Russell Brand)creates a shrink-ray so the reflective orb can be shrunk and brought back to earth. But as Gru and his diminutive little yellow pill-shaped helpers called Minions can get the rocket assembled and ready for blast off...three little orphans Margo(Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes(Elsie Fisher)and Edith(Dana Gaier)enter his life.

6,"Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures that follows an eerie criminal mastermind as he works to become the greatest, most despicable villain in the world. The film, starring the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a criminal intent on executing the largest heist in the history of the world, is often funny, always entertaining, but unfortunately much more forgettable than the animated films it goes against (see Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon). Regardless, for young kids or an adult audience alike, it provides enough wonderful visuals and comedy to keep you fully competent for it's fast paced 95-minute run time.",2011
7,"This is a CGI movie for kids and adults, where the plot is mainly from a villain's point of view. Gru(Gru) who is the bad guy or as bad as these CGI movies for kids and adults go. The rivalry between the villains is done well and the jokes are clean and yet fun. All the little things that happen in the background is fun to watch as well and just about everything is played out very well. I also enjoyed the mischievous music that is constantly played in this movie. It's also cute, charming and touching at times without being too cheesy, the minions was also one of the best part about this movie.",2011

He is at the top of his game, is planing is biggest heist to date, to steel a shrink ray, and get funding to build a rocket, fly into space, and shrink the moon, and steel it. With the help of his little yellow minions. But his plans quickly go awry, when another super villain wanna be named Vector(Jason Segel) steels the shrink ray from him, and just as Gru is smart, but Vector proves to be one step ahead of him. But he soon finds out that Vector has a weakness for cookies, when he sees three orphan girls sell him cookies. Gru decides to adopt the three girls, in hopes the will help him steel the shrink ray back, but will the plan go through? ",2010
7,"I love the concept of this film, how the viewpoint is of the villain and that conflict and battle of the egos' for the best villain title. But i think the film really kicked in when we are introduced to the cutest little orphan girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes (Agnes being the youngest and cutest) I loved the character development of Gru, who turns from failed villain to loving father and big softie. But sadly this film kept being interrupted by silly characters such as Vector (who just simply wasn't funny) and Dr. Nefario who was just a British idiot. But then when we are brought back to Gru's storyline which simply make the film what it is. So it did feel inconsistent, the storyline of Gru and the little kids is the best and i guess you can cope with the in between bits. Of course it's not as good as a PIXAR animation: because it didn't have that emotional depth as PIXAR does (it was emotional and sweet but thats it, nothing more) and a PIXAR film feels right and feels so nurtured by a group of enthusiastic artists and animators but this felt like just a good film. But putting that aside this is no doubt an enjoyable film, of course the little minions were cute, and there was some great character development in this film so i would say it's a good watch.",2010
4,"Oh Dear! This is fine you children 8 and under. However, for anyone older the plot is highly predictable, the characterisation belaboured and most of the jokes purile in the extreme. Comparisons with similar recent offerings (UP, Toy Story 3, How to Tame your Dragon) are inevitable and DM does not compare well on any measure you care to use. Might be worth buying the DVD to keep young kids occupied for 90 minutes when it's raining, but there are far better animated films out there that will entertain you better and will be worth a second or third showing.",2010

7,"Having caught every single episode of Haven up until now, i would say that Haven brings with it a rather weak plot outline in the weekly episodes. Do not expect mystery solving the likes of Fringe or humor like Stargate. Sure, it have its good lines in its episodes. However, what i felt was best in this show is the characters, actors, and that the pace of which the major plot arch in the show plays itself out. The characters are believable, the fr-enemy relationship between characters, the casual flirting, the writers did not overdo it. It clicked really nice. The actors were great, they were able to take some of the rather boring lines in the script and inject some life into them. Overall, i would give haven a chance and let it pick itself up and find its way around. At least it's much more watchable then the first season of V.",2010
9,"Haven is an excellent series for so many reasons but the most important are as follows: a) Genres; Haven crosses so many different genres, such as Thriller, some Comedy, some Romance, Mystery, Drama, Sci-Fi and Horror. There are more, but I'll stick to these as they are the ones that stand out most. b) Appeals to a mass audience; to follow up on that last point, given all that the show delivers, it's nearly (or even theoretically) impossible for any individual to enjoy SOME aspect of this show. It will draw you in for more. c) Location and Setting; The strong location backdrop and scene locations are hard to be beat with a series which relies almost entirely on a small Harbor Town...and a beautifully stunning one at that. Beaches, ocean, a marina, boardwalks, rocky Maine coastline (although filmed very close by in Canada) surrounded by thick forests makes it pleasurable to watch for the views alone. And the small harbour town, again, makes for a ""small town feel"" amongst the great cast of characters but also allows room for the outside to come in which can be good at the right time. And when this occurs, the show never fails to maintain its strong beliefs and appeal of the mysterious town of Haven. d) Great acting...a must in any TV or Film! e) Having a link to Stephen King and his novel ""The Colorado Kid"" definitely draws in even more viewers.",2012
10,"The first thing 'Haven' has going for it is the beautiful, seaside Nova Scotian landscape which is masterfully captured for this series. As a result, I feel compelled to take a vacation to a place I have never even considered! Secondly, an eclectic cast of actors make up the core of this new SYFY series. Nicholas Campbell, (formerly of 'Da Vincis Inquest') whose persona seems to slip from the pages of an Erle Stanley Gardner novel, and Lucas Bryant, who does not feel physical pain, represent the law as a father and son duo. Just their last name, Wuornos, colors this picture eerie. Emily Rose, who I really enjoyed in 'Jericho' (a show that ended before its time), performs the role of a temporarily displaced FBI agent who just might get some answers about her own unknown past from this strange little town, should she stay. In the meantime we are torn between the two men in her life, and getting some frights, as well as kicks and giggles out of various characters. ",2010
9,"When the X-files was over, I always wondered if there was ever going to be another show that I liked as much as TXF. Or a show that had all the elements that could be very appealing to me. Eight years later, Haven aired.",2011
10,"The series has the suspense, action, drama, and everything else you need to keep viewers tuned in. It is very original and has very good acting. I am not usually a syfy fan, so this show really surprises me. I wasn't able to watch it when it aired so I just recently began watching. I watched all 13 episodes in less than 3 days. I just couldn't stop. Every episode is amazingly entertaining. I think that Emily Rose is a great lead with Lucas Bryant doing a great job, and Eric Balfour is as astonishing as he always has been in every role. to the point Great Cast, Great Story-lines, Great Plots, and Great Jaw Dropping Cliffhangers= Top Notch Show",2011
5,"At first glance, Haven seems like a potentially good new series from Syfy. However, the mystery of the town in Maine and it's residents is over-shadowed by the real lack of realistic dialogue and emotion from the actors. As mentioned in another review, the main character is struck by lightening in the first episode. Not only does this not bother her at all, but she acts as though it's a normal FBI thing that happens daily. The dialogue is intended, I think, to be slightly comedic in serious situations, but instead presents itself as inappropriate for the situation and as such reminds the viewer of the preposterous situation the characters are in - and how unsurprised they are.",2010
10,"Haven is a so much fun to watch. This show combines small town privacy with supernatural terror. It is very much of a Twilight Zone sort of feel in Haven, ME. Basically, you get to have a GOOD Stephen King-type story/movie every week. It is not super bloody or gory (YAY!), but is suspenseful and has great character development that draws you in. Quirky back stories and long-term mystery keeps you coming back for more. The mystery that creates the ""troubles"" in the town seems to be of the paranormal sort and affect all characters in the mix. It is great group of actors who have a great on screen rapport. I am looking forward to spending some time in Maine this summer. Bring on season 3!!!",2011

8,"I have, so far, thoroughly enjoyed the pace of this series. Every episode has given us a small peak into the overarching mystery that is Haven, and has only increased my desire to see what is to come. Whether it is a tidbit of information about Audrey's mother, a strained interaction between Nathan and his father, the mysteriously combative relationship between Duke and Nathan (possibly my favorite) or ""the troubles"", every episode has offered some small insight. I think this series has set up such an interesting world with so many questions, and the writers are doing a fabulous job of giving us glimpses of the answers without unraveling all of Havens' secrets. Those are, after all, what make this town so very interesting.",2010
2,"I wanted to like this show as I love the premise. But I struggled through the first episode, desperately tried with the second, and even went on to three and four before throwing in the towel. Yes, it is beautifully set (which is why I didn't give it a 1) but the main characters are stone-like - it was impossible for me to engage with them on any level - and the stories are just silly.",2011

4,"This series is pretty typical work of the Syfy network. The premise is based on a small town in Maine called Haven, where some people get supernatural powers for unknown reasons. After a while you get the feeling you are watching some version of X-Men and Heroes mixed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You know the show you are viewing is in trouble when they start casting pro-wrestlers in the second season. I continued to watch up to the third season on Netflix but it refused to get better. ",2014
3,"The story centers around a woman who never met her mother. Through her work with the FBI, she found herself in a town in Maine that has some kind of magic going on in it. She finds evidence that leads her to believe her mother has some kind of connection to the town. Basically, throughout the show she is working on cases that involve the supernatural, which is something she is open enough to believe in. The plot in itself is similar to many other shows the center on the supernatural. Now, in regards to the show itself: The plot could be great were it carried out more appropriately. The actors are not par minus 3 or 4 of them, at most. The key role is held by a woman who really sucks the life out of the series with her acting and personality. There are scenes that have the worst visual effects I've ever seen in the 21st century, despite being around when there was much better software. Could have been a potential 8/10, but because of horrible actors, bad effects, and bad cinematography, it is a 3 at most, mainly because of the plot, which at sometimes also sucks. Do not recommend.",2012
4,"I've never written a review, but here goes. I watch primarily shows that have come out in the last 10-15 year, or around the year 2000 and on, because TV shows have gotten, for the most part, so amazingly good that they often rival movies for their acting, production, etc. When I watch most 70's and 80's TV I see wooden acting and hokey production- not as bad as 50's and 60's TV/movies, but not that much better.",2013
6,"I started to watch Haven mostly because of the fact that it is based on a Stephen King story, and at first it's what it actually did look like. At the moment I'm watching season 3 and wondering where it went, because it is now so much like any other TV show where the plot is not important as much as the relationship between the characters-four main characters at the moment.The plot has gone through the roof and not in a good direction,and too far, and actually, all that's keeping me watch it is the gorgeous scenery, this beautiful, splendid little town where they are filming the show, and to be honest, I am fond of the characters, so I find myself watching the show to look at the people and the set, because,like I said, it hardly makes any sense anymore, although it seems like it develops further on, it is simply going beyond believable even for a King fan",2012
6,"This series isn't terrible. There are some really strong actors (John Dunsworth of Pit Pony and Trailer Park Boys fame, for example), and there is a lot that they could do with this show. There seems to be so much promise: even if you wanted to do ""monster of the week"" like Supernatural, it could be paced better and written with more convincing banter in the dialogue. It just feels stilted to me (with some exceptions, like the brothers who run the newspapers), and that there are implausible leaps or solutions to the show (people who are stuffed with rags and scraps, anyone?), and even though it's supposed to be supernatural, someone needs to pay a little more attention to the continuity and even remote plausibility of the story. As a Haligonian, I want so badly to support this series, but unless it gets its act together, I'm going to have to sign off. Frankly, the fact it is filmed locally with local talent is the only reason I press on right now. We're eight episodes in, and I am sorry to say I don't see this being picked up by Syfy for another season.",2010
6,Haven has always been the type of show that was pretty good but it never really reached its full potential. The first three seasons defined the show well but once the fourth started everything turned a little sour and it lost the spark it once had.,2015
8,"When you first start watching Haven.. it seems to have a twin peaks feel to it but rest assured, it is not that confusing. What you get is an introduction to the town and its depth of strange goings on and the towns' diverse characters. This makes you want to learn more and find out why all these supernatural things keep happening. The fact that the town is cut off from the rest of America and most of the action is in Haven, actually enhances the appeal of the show as it gives it a personal feel and that you begin to 'know' the town and its characters. It will be interesting to see how the second season develops, as you would hope that the series continues in the same vein and does not go too far 'out there'..",2011
7,"The premise of this show has yet to show real originality, but has many things going for it. The central character Audrey Parker is a young FBI Special Agent who is sent single handed to the eponymous Haven to look for an escaped prisoner. He is dead by the time she gets there, but she finds the circumstances of his death suspicious. On arrival she is placed in or life or death situation and is saved by a local detective who is also son of the sheriff, and it turns out there are father/son issues. He is assigned to her and together they investigate the mysterious death; how did the crim fall so far away from the cliff he fell off? Fortunately for us the small town of Haven is filled with strange and interesting people, at least one of whom is endowed with a strange power - watch on for the denouement of episode 1! The acting is very able, the location stunningly beautiful, and there are plenty of quirky characters such as the two local newspapermen, not quite the Lone Gunmen! The choices of music are great as well. Well what are the writers reaching for? Northern Exposure meets the X-Files? Whatever, Audrey decides to stay on in the town to investigate the woman who looks so very much like from an 80s newspaper - the mythology starts to build, and it seems that her boss at the FBI is in cahoots, with whom, the sheriff?

10,"'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other.

10,"Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.",2010
10,"""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.",2010
10,"This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.",2010
9,"Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!",2010

Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film.

The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie.

Rob Reiner did a superb job telling it entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters Bryce and Juli tells each side of the story from each point of view. Sometimes the views are not the same. Juli's favorite spot in town is the top of the sycamore tree which is cut down by the yards owner. Juli starts to questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.",2010
10,"A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.",2013

10,Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.,2011
9,"This movie was great! An unorthodox film about crushes and young love, it was a break from all of that stereotypical romcoms that have more or less the same cheesy plot. This movie surprised me. There were a lot of happy moments, some sad moments. I really liked that the plot constantly shifts from the guy's point of view to the girl's point of view so we can better understand everything that's going on. It has its fair share of drama and sweetness that really brought back some childhood memories. The premise of first love kind of movie really got me on board with this film. It also shares some truthful life lessons with us and lets us relive all of those first love feelings. There are some subplots that weren't fully touched upon but overall the main plot was sweet and comfortingly romantic. I was definitely able to relate to their feelings and situations in some points. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",2014

8,"Although my (pre-)teen years were decades ago, it is sometimes nice to remind and compare - in particular, if script and directing are good. In Flipped, it is so indeed, plus a good choice of child actors provides additional value to the movie. Unlike many youth films made in this century, the story here focuses on human values, generation ties, friendship etc, not on ""cuteness"" or being popular on account of personal wealth. The two neighboring families depicted are different (creative vs. formal), and those differences bring interesting angles and twists into the storyline. The cast is evenly strong as well, the grown-up characters are performed by Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn... The latter was the most interesting to me and his presence on screen was more frequent as well. Kevin Weisman performs a small, but very difficult role of a retarded person.",2013
9,"iridescent - adjective: showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles When I hear ""romantic comedy"" I think of 20 something year olds in New York swapping corny lines via Twitter at a bar. Flipped takes a more adolescent perspective on love in a quainter town and in a quainter time. Interestingly enough, even though the main characters are children, the movie targets an adult crowd. Not because there is adult content, but because it takes an adult who has gone through life's lessons to appreciate the complex and pithy analogy and irony.

5,"I saw the good reviews and was excited for a family film I could enjoy without worrying about content. I can see how this would appeal to a person if they found the main characters endearing. I didn't. The girl is a flighty daisy-minded girl who will likely grow up and make beaded jewelery for a living and the typical boy will grow up to be the typical insignificant person he is working a dead-end blue collar job. There are apparent anachronisms, scenes of spectacularly unspectacular acting and the ""flipped"" visual effect that you find in bad power point presentations never gets old. Looking for the positive points though, I'll never have to watch it again.",2011
1,"From the opening frames this film had a cloying, cutesy ersatz sweetness that was annoying. The movie's look and feel resembles a television episode.

9,"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.",2011
10,"A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker.

In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.",2010

The mother has died after finding out the truth, now she wants her children to go on a mission to find the truth rather than reveal to them the truth through the letter. One could argue that the mother wanted to reveal the truth and reveal the horror and the pointlessness of the Middle East conflict.

5,"Incendies was a mixed bag, but I felt like it's negative aspects really bore down on it's positive ones. On the solid side of things, Denis Villeneuve has a real knack for storytelling and an eye for imagery that is truly gorgeous. Some of the shots here dug deep into my brain, be them haunting or beautiful, they managed to elicit a strong reaction from me.",2011
10,"Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",2011

I've been a member of IMDb for 12 years and most of the time the ratings on here kind of show me whether a movie is good or bad. Not so with 'Incendies'. It is rated 8,3 and is in the top 250, I can not see why that would be so. There is absolutely no depth to any character, no motivation, no background. The problems in some unknown unspecified middle east country are black and white. The only reason why you would make it so is that you do not want to do any research to make the situation believable. But the nail in the coffin was the unbelievable (literally) story. How did the writer get away with such a plot? At least when you read Sophocles you know there is much more to it than just the plot. This was embarrassing, all the more because it is in the top 250.",2014

Worse, the entire movie felt like a string of clips put together for an hour and a half and not like a movie at all.

I understood that this was to be a children's movie, but the series was for children as well and I loved that. What could go wrong? This movie was a cinematic abomination. The entire movie, which covers the first ""Book"" of the series is rushed together and jumps around in a totally nonsensical manner. There is absolutely NO time spent on characterization. None of the characters had any depth at all and may as well have been cardboard cutouts. Major plot points are summarized through narration or montage and the film would leave any person not familiar with the story absolutely dumbfounded. With all of my heart I discourage you from seeing this movie. Go see Karate Kid. Go see Killers. Go see (I cannot believe I am saying this) Eclipse. Just stay away from this movie.",2010

However, I didn't know that would make me literally want to leave the theater in the middle of the very movie. How someone could do such damage in approximately an hour and forty minutes is entirely beyond me. It was ridiculous, the only way to describe it is a $150 million dollar failure. I could understand if the effects were not up to par but the biggest disappointment was the acting. It was so stiff and it never once felt like the actors meant a word they were saying. I caught a glimpse of an interview with Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone on TV and even their approach to that felt so wrong. It felt kind of disgusting to see as I've lately been watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (with extras) almost religiously for the past month.",2010

1,M.Night.Shyamalan ought to be ashamed of himself. I went to the midnight premier of the Last Airbender as a hopeful long time fan of the wonderful animated series. Less than thirty minutes into the feature however I realized that my hopes would be dead on the ground by the time the movie ended.,2010
1,"The only thing I can really say about The Last Airbender is this: Epic  Fail. Just how epic? Paramount Pictures gave M. Night Shyamalan $150  million dollars to adapt the popular Nickolodeon cartoon for the big  screen. What they got is an absolute mess of a movie, complete with  poor acting, the most hackneyed script ever, and a last-minute  conversion to 3-D that only serves to destroys what was possibly some  lush cinematography.  The Last Airbender is perhaps the worst film of the summer, a feat I  thought Jonah Hex had locked down. However, Airbender makes a  determined effort. Let me put it this way, as good as Toy Story 3 was,  Airbender is just as bad. It was hard to find anything wrong with Toy  Story 3. It is nigh impossible to find anything right with Airbender.  The story is ridiculously complex. In a world where people can  manipulate (bend) the four elements of air, earth, fire and water,  depending on their tribal affiliation, there exists a being (the  Avatar) who can manipulate all four. This person is also the sole being  capable of communing the the ""spirit world"" which serves to keep things  in balance. This being went missing 100 years ago, only to be found in  a giant ice sphere by two children of the water tribe. In the 100 years  the Avatar has been gone, the Fire tribe has begun conquering the  others, though we're never really told why. The disgraced Prince  Zuko(Dev Patel, the Slumdog Millionaire himself) of the Fire tribe  wants to the Avatar so he can return to his family. The Water children  need to save the Avatar to ensure the Fire people don't win. For this  point on it becomes to silly to try and summarize.  Shyamalan succumbs to his own hubris, loading the film with long,  boring exposition communicated through long, boring speeches that I'm  sure were meant to be inspirational. Instead they are clichéd,  burdensome mounds of words that only slow down an already languidly  paced film. He heaps some unnecessary narration on top of the  exposition, condescending to the audience as he does it. Perhaps the  narration was put in to help the film's target audience, the  prepubescent b0ys and girls who watch the cartoon, understand where  this convoluted story is going. Sadly, it doesn't. The dialogue is so  corny, it left me squirming a little. Also bothersome is the ham-fisted  way Shyamalan expounded his themes, which seem to be responsibility,  responsibility, and the horror of industry destroying nature (lifted  with little change from the Lord of the Rings). Seriously, the Fire  people sail their world's oceans in giant steel yachts that feature  gigantic smokestacks over visible flame. These stacks spew out a never  ending cloud of dark, ashy smoke. The metaphor could not be more clear  had it just been printed as a subtitle across the screen.  The acting is bad across the board. The child cast as Aan, the Avatar,  Noah Ringer, a wooden child actor if there ever was one. He speaks his  lines as if reciting them of a cue card just off screen. The two Water  tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) are  no better. A colleague of mine I saw the film with noted that Rathbone  seemed downright anxious every time he was on screen, delivering his  lines tersely, with little emotion. The older actors just phone it in.  The usually reliable Cliff Curtis looks bored stiff as the leader of  the Fire people, while the main antagonist, a Fire general played by  Aasif Mandvi, is neither menacing nor scary. He comes off as a  schoolyard bully, all bluster and no balls. The only actor I found  brought any sort of depth to his role was Shaun Toub (Yinsen from Iron  Man). Playing Prince Zuko's Uncle Iroh, he's conflicted between his  duty to the prince and his beliefs in the spirit world, something the  Fire people have come to consider children's superstition.  Perhaps the most egregious error of the movie is the 3-D conversion.  3-D tends to suck all the light out of the images it portends to  display, leaving viewers with a murky picture where shadow and light  blend together. There are no crisp lines in the film, no real detail.  Which is a shame, as the film's setting should've been its biggest  strength. The movie travels from an arctic campsite, where the whites  should have popped against the bluish hues of the ice and water around  it. When it travels to warmer climates, the greens and browns should  have been awe-inspiring. It's not. It all looks faded. Much as with  Clash of the Titans, the 3-D is barely noticeable throughout the film,  and contributes nothing. I fear that Hollywood has cynically latched  onto this fad for the high ticket price it commands rather than for any  real artistic merit. My only relief was the movie was short, so I  didn't get the usual headache 3-D movies tend to give me.  I didn't expect much going into The Last Airbender. However, I didn't  expect it to be quite so bad. It's like watching a train wreck unfold  over 94 minutes. The problem is, that 94 minutes feels like an  eternity. The end of the film hints at a sequel. I hope some divine  being takes mercy on us all and never lets that happen.",2010
1,"First off... Did M. Night Shyamalan even watch the Avatar series on TV? Or take a glance at it? Also, Dante Basco, the original voice actor said that he would be interested in playing Zuko, but they made the cast predominantly white. The show was based in Asia, how do you screw that up? It was White people, Arabic people, and Hispanics.. Now, there is nothing wrong with any of those ethnicities (I'm white) but, none of them looked Asian. If you have seen the series, you'll hate it, if you haven't seen the series, the lack of plot line and the anti-climatic story will make you hate it even more: seeing as how you won't understand what you just watched for almost 2 hours.",2010

I hope that the man or men responsible for this never get work again. This is what I would hope qualifies as a career killer, because I wish I had slept instead of going to this movie. I want my money, time, and expectations back. As in I expected at least good fun with the 'bending' or fight/dance scenes. I feel like I just got served... Do not watch or let ANYONE YOU KNOW GO TO THIS MOVIE, AND SOMEONE SHOULD PETITION TO CANCEL THE OTHER TWO(three?).",2010
1,"WARNING: MANY SPOILERS!! I just returned from a midnight showing of The Last Airbender, and it was by far the worst movie I've seen in some time. I'm a HUGE fan of the cartoon, and even after reading poor reviews from other users, decided to see it anyway. There are very few films that I can't stand, and I thought that since I was a fan, I would enjoy seeing it even though I was prepared to be disappointed. In short, this film contains nothing that made the show great. There's no chemistry between Kitara, Sokka and Aang. Appa and Momo had exactly no personality. The entire story seemed to be presented far too quickly, and with no emphasis on any one particular aspect. It essentially goes from Aang being rescued from Zuko's ship to the Northern Water Tribe with a montage in between after Sokka suggests they hit a bunch of small towns and create rebellions against the Fire Nation. They briefly go into the concepts of bending. They briefly mention the spirit world. They don't mention the Avatar state, although Aang uses it at the end. The characters are never developed. You never get the feeling of any bonds of friendship. Aang isn't lovable and playful. Sokka isn't funny. Kitara isn't motherly and caring. The bending is dumbed down. Only a few great firebenders can create their own fire. The rest of the bending seems like far too much work for hardly any payoff. For example, at one point it takes 5+ earthbenders about 7 seconds to throw one rock about the size of a dinner plate. I guess the best way to put it is that it looks as if the benders are dancing while the elements almost move themselves. It doesn't feel tight and/or coordinated and all the elements move far too slow. The only characters that even remotely look like their cartoon counterparts are Aang, Sokka, Kitara and Yue. Zuko, Ozai, Zhao, Ihro, and Pakku look completely different. The dialogue made me cringe the entire time. Also, many of the names are pronounced differently. Ihro is pronounced Eeroh, Sokka is Soka (like the word ""so""), Aang is more like Ung, and the word Avatar is pronounced like Ah-vatar. Many great characters are just not there, like Bumi, Jet, Roku, Kyoshi or any of the Kyoshi warriors. Not even the cabbage merchant. I don't understand how a film like this could be green-lighted. To conclude, if you like the show, you won't find anything you liked about it in this film other than a watered-down version of the main plot of Book 1 and some weak bending. If you didn't like or didn't see the show, then you will most likely be confused and bored and possibly even angry you wasted your money. Or amused at how ridiculous this movie is. True fans will see this anyway and they can't be blamed, but if you haven't been looking forward to this movie for awhile, don't waste your time.",2010
1,"Whenever an adaptation is mode, it is hard to view said film in any other context than in comparison to the source material. While it is important to take things in context, it is also important to view a film as what it is - that being the film medium. In the case of the critically acclaimed television series Avatar: The Last Airbender it would be impossible to adequately recreate or adapt every single thing in the entire first season in to a movie. M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is an adaptation of the first season or ""Book 1"" of the television series.

As an avid ATLA viewer and a living fan, I'm insulted by the lack of respect to make this movie what it could have been. It should have followed the series to the T.

Also, he deleted all kinds of material that could have easily been included (at minimal cost) Even the mention of the 'spirit world' at the beginning was betrayed at the end when Princess Yue ascended as a moon spirit.

9,"HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one ""action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects"" after another. But wait...",2010

8,"I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.",2010

It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good.

What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.",2010

4,"Ah, the pre-summer action movie. Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate it ",2010
2,"There are SPOILERS here, so beware....",2010
1,"Yesterday I watched Clash of the Titans at a local theatre and I have to be sincere, the direction of the movie was so bad that I was speechless for a few minutes for all the wrong reasons. I'm still trying to understand how someone could leave such a rich tale so undeveloped on every front with 106 mins of running time at his disposal. ",2010
6,Is it wrong to remake a movie just so you can update its special effects? Hollywood doesn't seem to think so. The classic claymation and stop motion sequences of old are some of the first things we think about when bringing up the subject of mythology movies. But one still cannot help but think how totally awesome it would look if it were updated.,2010
3,"One word, DREADFUL!! Never have i felt so let down watching a movie, maybe i was just to hyped up so its easy to get disappointed, but no, it was just that poor? The acting was ridiculous, as was almost everything else in the movie.",2011
1,"And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie? Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original CLASH OF THE TITANS. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.",2010
3,"The myth of Perseus is based on deep philosophy and tragic elements, which have been popular throughout the centuries. You may want to Google it and read the original. You might discover a few things that didn't know, for example that there is no Cracken, no scorpions, and that Medusa's head ended up decorating goddess Athena's shield, just as real shields had often Medusa painted, to scare the opponents.",2010
7,"I've never seen the 1981 original version of Clash of the Titans. I wasn't originally planning on seeing this new updated version either. Going by the previews, this looked like nothing more than a CGI-fest...which is what it pretty much ended up being. To quote Sam Worthington from various interviews, it's basically him ""in a skirt with a rubber sword, killing monsters"". If you're expecting anything more than that, then yes, you will probably be disappointed.",2010
1,"If you want to see Clash of the Titans with a compelling narrative, good creatures, good action sequences, and a SUPERB cast, watch the 1981 original. It may be a little dated, and some of the effects are certainly old-fashioned by today's standards, but it has something the remake doesn't even come close to achieving: - Class!",2011
2,"The producers of Clash of the Titans brought the story of Perseus to a place it has never been to, then told it to get out of the car and walk home. It was definitely no more brutal than being hit in the face with a bag of bronze statues; moreover, it was more interesting than the instructions that come with a hair brush.",2011
1,"Whilst waiting for this film to come out I must admit that I nursed a growing sense of expectancy: the cast seemed strong; the original film has achieved cult status; the storyline is a classic dating back to Ancient Greece and from the trailers it looked aesthetically pleasing. In my naivety I couldn't see where Hollywood could go wrong, after all it's never let us down in the past! Right?! ",2010
3,"This film would have been in line with Louis Leterrier's previous work: highly enjoyable high octane action movies that even adults can appreciate. Then somewhere along the lines, the greedy and short sighted producers decided to cash-in a meager few extra bucks by ""converting"" into 3D a movie shot in 2D. The result is fake at best with fuzzy, dark and double edged images. For most of the movie you'll feel the urge to remove your glasses. Too bad for the decent cast (special kudos to Mads Mikkelsen as usual), nice photography and music by a promising newcomer Ramin Djawadi. Bottom line: Recommended 2D, Disaster in 3D Not everybody is James Cameron.",2010

5,"I, being a huge fan of the original, was probably more excited to see this movie than anyone. And in 3-D no less. So...I walk into the theater with my 3-D glasses on my head, holding my $5 popcorn and get ready to watch my favorite childhood movie and...and...and...oh no. Oh no. This is awful. I sat through the movie wondering why I don't care about any of these characters. On top of that, I'm wondering why I spent the extra money to see it in 3-D. The best 3-D effects came during the opening credits. Other than that, I could have thrown the glasses away. Now I know why James Cameron is not a big fan of making films 3-D after the fact. To make a long story short, I was incredibly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Go see the original ""Clash of the Titans"" if you want to lose yourself in a good movie. After seeing this one all I could think of was ""oh how the mighty titans have fallen.""",2010
1,"Is worst than I expected. I walked into the theater ready to see a bad remake of one of my favorite movies of all times, but this movie was a lot worse than I could even imagine. It wasn't half the movie and my wife wanted to leave the theater, and how can you blame her? Since you heard the narration at the beginning of the movie you got that feeling: ""there is something wrong here"". And that feeling just grow every single minute while you watch the movie. The whole plot of the movie is based on the hate and resentment of the human against the Gods? In the original movie, Perseus grows to be a hero because of love and because this was his destiny. In this movie Perseus is just a guy with bad attitude who suddenly changes from a fisher man to a one man army with a huge ego.",2010
1,"Sam Worthington made a shitty performance acting like pompous bastard. The whole movie was about HIM, and how great he is, and he is JUST a man and he spits on faces of gods. The whole movie was 2d no matter if you're wearing 3d glasses or not. the plot could have been good, but not with sam worthlessgton shouting lines from avatar... i.e. ""i need your help"" and ""someone has to stand and say - ENOUGH"". This movie is a rip off and it deserves the worst evaluation. 1. It's obvious that director and other staff involved tried to make this movie look like avatar, but they have failed. It is NOTHING compared to Avatar, which in my opinion is great.",2010
5,"3D is not perfect. Avatar may have shown its full potential whilst Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon have continued to prove it can be utilised successful, but if not given the time and effort it requires, the third dimension on screen can actually detract from the movie. Unfortunately this is the case here. The last-minute decision by the filmmakers to add the extra dimension feels tacky and lazy. The objects in the foreground don't seamlessly meld with those in the background and a lot of the action is blurry and unfocused. The desert-brown palate is dimmed even more by the glasses – something the aforementioned movies could cope with due to their vibrant colours – and all of the wide shots are blotchy at best.",2010
3,"Remakes these days are almost always terrible and having seen production photos of COTT before its release, photos that didn't inspire much confidence, I decided not to see the remake on the big screen, opting to wait for it on DVD or download. I always had a love/hate approach to the original which I saw at the cinemas when I was a young teen. So take this as someone who's not a fanatic of the original and was going to hate any remake from the get go. With that said the new film is thoroughly awful in almost every way possible. Except for the beginning (which is OK, not great), the action packed but not suspenseful Medusa scene and the clearly OTT ending, there's nothing much else to see. The entire cast of characters is uniformly unpleasant. Not one likable character in the whole thing, including a growling Perseus (played by one-note Aussie actor Sam Worthington). This is difference with the original. I basically liked almost every characters, no matter how cardboard they were.",2010
2,"Clash of the Titans is a remake of the original movie from the eighties, when you're reading this review, take in mind that I haven't seen the original movie. Almost everything about this movie was boring. The story was quite bad as I found myself drifting in and out of the movie, unable to pay much attention to it. The acting wasn't very good as half of the cast looked like they didn't want to be there and just tried their best to hide that fact. The characters were quite boring and you didn't care for any of them at all. The direction wasn't bad but I can't say the same for the script, as that was terribly boring. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the battles, which were quite entertaining and were executed quite well. The CGI was okay as well, it wasn't terrible but it weren't all that great.",2010
1,"By remaking The Clash Of The Titans the director, actors/actresses and all those involved are opening up opportunity for comparison to the original. There's no denying that, so that's the angle I view it from.",2010
7,"I saw Clash of the Titans in an early screening, and I didn't expect the film to be good. I thought it was just another ripoff. But at the end of the film I was really liked it. The creatures looked great, the acting was good. And I thought it would be corny, but the majority of it wasn't at all. I am actually really glad that I saw this film. I really think Sam Worthington did an okay job as an actor, it was certainly believable. If he keeps doing films like Avatar and Clash of the Titans, he could have a long career in his life.",2010
5,"Clash of the Titans is one of the earliest films I can remember having watched it as a kid in a big theatre, not the multiplexes we have today, and I liked it so much, it probably ranks up there as one film that I've watched the most times, on television reruns, or off a recorded video tape. The story's fairly simple, but to a kid it had plenty of charm, and a basic 101 guide to Greek mythology, of which the promiscuity of the Greek gods struck me as quite odd, save for the need to produce plenty of demi-god heroes from which stories are spun of.",2010
7,"When Bruce Willis plays his indestructible yet on the surface everyday guy he is right where the audience loves him. In RED, ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"", he has a close to perfect vehicle. And, so RED delivers in spite of a fairly ridiculous scenario of a group of ex-CIA operatives,or which Willis is one, being singled out for execution on the eve of the vice-president announcing his candidacy for president.",2010
8,"When I first saw the trailer for The Expendables, I was already thinking of the interesting and funny relationship between the characters played by those action icons. After a zillion trailers and a movie, I was sourly disappointed. Now, I don't know who's fault it is, but relative to The Expandables, I almost haven't heard of Red before its release. However, it was exactly what I was looking for.",2010
8,"You're wrinkly, have health issues and your age is higher than the calibre of your gun. So what's a senior to do? Why get a bigger gun of course. That is certainly one of many philosophies in the action comedy RED (That would be Retired Extremely Dangerous for those still living in fear of Communism. Hey, it is the right age bracket) which collects a who's who of Oscar-grade talent and has them blow stuff up real good. This is but the fourth men-on-a-mission film so far this year after The Expendables, The A-Team and The Losers, heck even Inception could fall into that group. The good news is with the exception of the latter it is the best of the bunch and by far the most fun you're bound to have this fall season. ",2010
7,"Silly is the operative word but also very entertaining. What did it for me was the cast. Helen Mirren lifts whatever she is in and the endearing thing about her is that she's not ""precious"" She goes for it and her fun becomes our fun. Hurrah for that! To go into the plot seems an exercise in futility because that's not what we will enjoy particularly but Mirren holding a machine gun with relish, the wonderful Mary Louise Parker tied to a bed or Brian Cox with a Russian accent and a mischievous spark in his eye. John Malkovich, I hope he soon plays a woman, he would be marvelous as Edna in ""The Edna May Oliver Story"" He is such fun to watch. Bruce Willis can do this kind of film in his sleep and he kind of does and Morgan Freeman? Well, he's always worth the trouble. The film has already vanished from my brain but the cast is glorious.",2010
8,"Red manages to balance the line between action thriller, and light comedy, and does it quite well.",2010
7,"RED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Red completely justified to its Slogan ""Retired-Extreme-Dangerous"". The whole movie plays out really cool, funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action, Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a non-stop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED, I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit, Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! Mary-Louise Parker is adorable, after watching her racy/funny side on ""WEEDS"" from almost 4, 5 years; it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch, the chemistry between Bruce Willis & Mary-Louise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious; I never knew this man can be so funny, his moves, dialogues thus every thing was great, and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess, though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren, who just simply stole the show, seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable. She brought the utmost charisma to the team of RED. The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban, his tux made him move like 007 & he gave an utmost completion to the RED team, the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox, Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!",2010
10,"I never thought much of this film prior to viewing it, as many others might not have either, but if you have even the slightest inclination to view this, you must! The story is typical, nothing special about the basic plot synopsis, but the delivery and the interesting plot twists keeps it fresh and interesting. The humour is hilarious, mostly a subtle humour that is apparent throughout the entire film, in nearly every scene.",2010
9,"You will leave this film laughing. The action scenes are really good but it's the characters and actors that makes this film worth seeing. The casting in this film was perfect! Great all around supporting cast. Morgan Freeman is always a nice touch to any film. Helen Miran firing a Rambo sized gun is worth the admission alone. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich! John Malkovich steals the show with maybe the performance of his career. If Johnny Depp can get nominated for ""Pirates"" and Robert Downey Jr. can get nominated for ""Tropic Thunder"", then Malkovich should get nominated for this, seriously. Every time he came on screen the whole theatre would be dying with laughter.",2010
8,Went to watch a preview screening of this last night. I should qualify that I'm a big fan of Bruce Willis especially when he plays this kind of character - a tough guy with a wry sense of humour.,2010
3,"I guess the people who found this film 'hilarious' and 'amazing' must be really easily pleased. I found it overly long, badly scripted, predictable and poorly acted. Malkovitch put some effort into his part as Marvin the paranoid android, err, sorry, ex-CIA agent but all of the other big names seem to have decided that what this 'comedy' needed was for them to ham it up. And Brian Cox was the hammiest of the porcine bunch.",2010
5,"¨He got old. Then some thumb-sucker came along and tagged him RED: Retired, Extremely Dangerous.¨ Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler's Wife, and Flightplan) had the privilege of directing a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss. A lot of big names for the latest adaptation of the DC Comic graphic novel written by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. One would expect nothing could go wrong with a movie with such great star power, but I was disappointed with this lightly entertaining comedy slash action flick. Red suffers from a poorly adapted screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber (the guys who brought us one of the worst films of 2009: Whiteout). The plot is really bad, and the actors do the best they can in order to save the film. There are some funny moments (but far too few) thanks to the talent from the entire cast that save the movie from falling into horrible territory. John Malkovich gives a very comedic and surprising performance, but unfortunately he doesn't get enough screen time to save the movie. The rest of the cast give good performances, but they are far from memorable. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker (Weeds) is pretty decent, although nothing we haven't seen before. I really expected this movie would have a lot more funnier moments, but the screenplay failed to help out the great cast. Red could have been much better if the producers would have taken more time in finding better screenwriters. I just felt this movie was like an All-Star team without a good coach to help them win the championship. With a better plot, Red would have been a great and memorable movie.",2011
6,"I haven't been to the cinema much recently as for me there hasn't really be many films out that have caught my attention. The last film I saw at the pictures was the impressive The Town directed by Ben Affleck that I saw in late September. Red I saw in a trailer prior to that and it looked like terrific fun and was a film I was very much looking forward to. The 7.7 IMDb rating on this film in my opinion is a little extravagant and isn't really justified. It's for me hard to avoid the conclusion that the director Robert Schwentke just placed all the fun moments in the trailer for the sake of drawing the audience to the cinema in a way, but it isn't entirely true.",2010
1,"Sigh, hard to believe people are giving this anything over a 4/10. Red was a horrible movie all the way through. From the directing style to the just down right bad jokes, this movie was just another piece of garbage that will be forgotten in 6 months. I just don't get who this movie would appeal too? Maybee really REALLY ignorant couples who enjoy laughing with an audience. The only thing missing from the film was a laugh track so everyone could chuckle on command.",2010

Frank has a crush on the pension department attendant Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), who is a lonely woman that has disappointing dates, and he tears his checks to talk to her. When a team of heavily armed killers break in Frank's house, he escapes and travels to Sarah's house. When Frank meets Sarah, he explains that he is a former CIA agent tagged RED – Retired Extremely Dangerous - and her life is in danger since they have had many phone conversations. Sarah does not believe in his words, and Frank abducts her and he crosses the country with Sarah to meet his loyal friends and gets information. He meets and teams up with Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) that lives in a nursing home; the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) that lives hidden in the woods in Florida; the retired Russian spy Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox); and the British assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren). Their investigation shows a huge conspiracy, where the Vice-President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon) and the gangster and former CIA agent Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss) are involved.

So what went wrong? I dare to say almost everything: Stiff and lifeless acting, lame jokes and a horrible soundtrack. If you watched the trailer then you have already seen the best parts! I highly doubt that anyone with a brain is able to enjoy the story let alone the whole movie.

Clearly Robert Schwentke isn't one of them!",2010
8,"I saw a screening for this movie today and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It has action, comedy, suspense and even a little romance. The film had me enthralled; several times during the film I actually jumped in my seat due to a sudden surprise. Other times I laughed out loud and clapped. The cast had a lot of chemistry; John Malkovich stole the show as a crazy, paranoid retired CIA operative. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren were completely believable as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) former CIA. Another thing to appreciate about this film: No plot holes. Everything was plausible; nothing was too far fetched. I didn't roll my eyes even once during the entire film.",2010
8,"RED (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) is directed by Robert Schwentke and loosely based around the three-issue comic book limited series of the same name created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. It stars Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox & Ernest Borgnine. The screenplay is by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber.",2010
10,"The Coen brothers are known for being one of the best filmmakers of our time. They both compliment each other perfectly. When I heard they were remaking the 1969, John Wayne classic True Grit, I was extremely excited and had incredibly high expectations of the film. Being a major fan of Western movies, I was really interested how it would turn out. I wanted the movie to be more faithful to it's original source material, Charles Portis novel, than the 1969 film had been. I was also hopeful that Jeff Bridges would fill the huge shoes of the classic, legendary John Wayne. I was hoping that they would blend the humor of the original 1969 film with some of the suspense or thrills from earlier Coen brothers films like No Country For Old Men or Fargo. But not become way too violent that it causes to stay completely unrecognizable to Charles Portis classic novel. ",2010
8,"As is to be expected, the film has all the classic Coen flourishes, first and foremost its use of language. The Coens have always been impeccably tuned in to language and accents, from the most creative use of swear words in The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading to the colorful, stylized prose of The Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn't There to the very distinct accents in Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. In classic Coen fashion, the use of language is very much emphasized in True Grit. The characters have a very distinct use of words, lifted right out of the novel and, as it feels at least, right out of the time period the film takes place in. Unlike something like Deadwood which features a very modernized and stylized version of 18th century speak, the dialogue in True Grit sounds completely authentic and, along with the impeccable and accurate-feeling costume and set design, really adds to the realism of the world True Grit creates. Accents are also very important – the harsh Southern drawl that the Coens have always been attracted to is very prominent and plays a very large role in the film.",2010
8,"Near the end of October, I handpicked True Grit along with Black Swan and The Fighter as three films that could potentially go on to become the film of the year. Joel and Ethan Coen were reuniting with Jeff Bridges after all in True Grit and that was exciting enough, but the Coens managed to take a remake of a western from 1969 starring John Wayne and give it a modern retelling without desecrating the original in the process.",2010
10,"Those of you who wonder why someone would remake a good film, need to withhold judgment until seeing this film. It was one of the most authentic westerns I've ever had the privilege of viewing, and I am a die-hard western aficionado, and true-west historian. The costumes, the buildings, the interiors, and the dialogue were so meticulously crafted that I felt entirely immersed in a world long since forgotten, and often misunderstood. The acting was unbelievable as you'd expect from such established, accomplished thespians, but Hailee Steinfeld was a revelation, holding her own, if not carrying the entire film on her relatively small shoulders. The Brothers Coen have justified their choice to adapt Charles Portis' novel, not remake the John Wayne classic. The impact, and visceral reality of life in such places and times, coupled with the abrupt, brutal violence is something you didn't fully grasp in the grandstanding, heroics of the 1969 version. I applaud the Coens for exercising restraint and understatement to allow the scenes and the situations to breathe and take there natural course. Overall, it was an amazing cinematic experience that truly transports the viewer to a very real and fully realized time and space that crackles with fire and true grit.",2010
10,"To be honest I was never a big fan of western movies... Somehow I made myself to watch True Grit - had big doubts about it, but after all it was Coen brothers movie and it got only positive reviews all over internet. When the movie had finished I was completely stunned by how the story got me into it, how interesting and absorbing it was from the very first minutes!!! The characters were so genuine and extraordinary in the same time. I guess each of them could have their own individual movie, but here we had 3 of them crossing their paths of faith. Acting was just PERFECT - honestly I think this is Bridges best role, not to mention fantastic Damon and brilliant Steinfeld! In addition to that scenography and photography was excellent. Everything gave the viewer almost 2 hours of an amazing story, told in the best possible manner. Thank you brothers Coen for this masterpiece!",2011
10,"I am a fierce John Wayne fan. He was really great as Rooster in True Grit. The new version is not the same movie as John Wayne's. Don't compare the two. The story line's are similar, but that's it. This new version is a whole new story than the one written for John Wayne. This is a great movie, with truly great acting for all involved.",2010
10,"True Grit is not a remake, but a re-imagining. Narrated by Mattie Ross, played by Hailee Steinfeld, who makes her feature film debut, we find Mattie picking up the pieces following the death of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (Brolin). A headstrong girl, Mattie isn't looking for a handout; she's looking for justice. She is directed towards Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), a Federal Marshall whose reputation for shooting his prisoners makes him the right fit for Mattie's cause.",2011
8,"Let's get the comparisons with Henry Hathaway's version of the Charles Portis novel out of the way. The Coen Brothers certainly knew that, however much they want to 'go back to the source material,' their film would play against Hathaway's version.",2010
7,"Don't get me wrong, True Grit is a good movie. In a time when most films seen in cinemas are made for teenagers, it can appeal to anybody regardless of age. The gunfights (not much) and talking (a lot) give it a nice pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat while not being chaotic enough to confuse your father.",2011
10,"Just came back from seeing ""True Grit."" Now this is the kind of film that the average person goes to the movies to see. It was amazing, highly entertaining, suspenseful, funny, and had a great story line. Jeff Bridges was fantastic, as was Matt Damon. Josh Brolin was good too, the only problem is I didn't get to see enough of him. He is definitely an up and coming actor that I hope to see more of. However, the best acting in the entire film was done by Hailee Steinfeld. Hailee plays the role of Mattie Ross and she is incredible. She really is 14 and held her own with the likes of Damon, Bridges, and Brolin. This film was an excellent western and comedy. There were several times that the theater was filled with laughter. I will definitely see this film again and may even purchase the DVD.",2010
5,"Sorry folks, the 2010 version can't hold up to the 1969 version. I can't see an academy award going to anyone for this movie. It was okay, but I'm to much of a fan of the 69 version to rate this movie any higher. I found so much in this movie that compared to the first that the sequences, dialogue timing, actors actions, etc, of the new version in some cases didn't make sense. I found some of the dialogue was not as fluid as it could be. It almost appears the movie was made in a rush when you listen to some of the lines. I can't say this has been some of the best acting for Bridges and Damon either. Hallie Steinfeld however deserves all the credit for the success of this movie.",2011
1,"Let me just start out by saying I have never reviewed anything in my life...OK maybe I have (music album). I just created an account to review this awful movie! I have never seen the original, but after watching this, I wish I had. This is sooo boring I can't believe all the people praising it. and WHAT BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY?! there is nothing special about it!!are some people just so desperate for a good movie that they go on lying to them selves so they can like it! I understand people got different tastes, but the way positive reviews just keep on coming makes me wonder if I am the crazy one! No Country For Old Men had a beautiful cinematography, but this one was soo pale.",2010
1,"Had the original 1969 production of ""True Grit"" never been made, I would have said this new version is a pretty decent movie. HOWEVER, not only have I seen both movies, unlike most here, I ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK by Charles Portis. Matt Damon admittedly never saw the original film and the Coen brothers apparently say they only saw it as kids. Quite intriguing since they supposedly wrote the screenplay and manage to match much of the original film's dialogue word for word. Additionally, much of the acting here is nearly identical(Voice inflections and such. Hmmm).",2011
6,"It seems that the consensus of opinion is that this is another masterful work by the Coen Bros, but it left me disappointed. In a nutshell it felt to me that they never got the movie together. ",2011
1,"I was very excited to go see this film with my husband as we both love westerns. To both our horror this film was very slow and too manicured and staged to even be halfway believable. The acting was stiff and I felt the lines were awkward and unrealistic for the times. The cast just did not work well together and were simply reading their lines and had no feeling or expression in the presentation. The film went on and on and on and never did pick-up. Wow....I wish we could get back to the great westerns with awesome actors that can really give you a heart pounding performance and keep you entertained throughout the entire story. If you love a true western that really makes you believe & feel involved and interested in the story then I would highly suggest you skip this film, it is by far the worst western I and my husband have every seen!Our friends also saw this film and found it terrible!",2011
6,"Owning the original, and having looked forward to seeing the new version, I find myself wondering why the Coens rewrote the script to have LaBoeuf live, instead of following the original script and letting him die of the blow to the head administered by Chaney, after guiding his horse to pull Cogburn and Mattie from the snake pit. His death makes the outcome of the journey more bleak - the attempt to bring Chaney to justice costs yet another life - and makes Cogburn's rescue of Mattie especially urgent. It gave extra texture to what had seemed like amusing superficiality in Glenn Campbell's original performance. I wondered whether star-status made the Coens, or their money-men, think ""we can't kill Damon off - his public wouldn't accept it."" Result: LaBoeuf's presence becomes mere comic relief, and this version of the film is weakened.",2011
1,"Most of the movie involved Rooster and Labeef arguing. Who likes listening to a drunk and a liar argue. The first time may have been a little amusing but it wore off quickly. Mattie was boring. Most of Rooster's monologue was mumbled, to give the appearance of being drunk I suppose but if you can't understand someone then what is the point. John Wayne's Rooster was a lovable person. Bridges is just a drunk that no one would care about. Why the Clown Bros. thought they could remake a classic and outdo it amazes me. There was nothing that captivated me, there was nothing amusing about any part of the movie. It was quite painful watching it. Overall the movie was terrible. I'm sorry I wasted my time.",2011
4,"Okay, I admit it. I have never had that much love for the Coen Brothers' films. Even ""No Country for Old Men"", which I did enjoy, was marred by its botched ending. Plus the original ""True Grit"" remains one of my favourite westerns. So you can probably already guess where this review is going. I'm sorry but once again I cannot square all the praise this film has received and its subsequent Oscar nominations against the film that I actually saw today.",2011
3,"Headed by an all star cast & one new comer True Grit is the story of a young girl looking for revenge for her fathers death in 1877 Arkansas. Directed by the Coen brothers in crowd pleasing mode much more akin to O Brother,Where Art Thou? than No Country for Old Men. Which is disappointing & misleading because the trailers framed Grit more like the latter rather than the former. The performers are all there up on the screen doing what they should be but are left hanging scene after scene with nothing to do. Except walk here,babble out dialogue there & look completely lost the entire length of the movie. Admitedly the Coen brothers have done some extraordinary work but lets face it they have done an equal number of crap pictures as well. The problem with True Grit is that it sticks too close to the source material never not once taking any risk in telling this story in a way that would breathe new life into it. It also does the western a huge disservice. Im not interested in bigger set pieces & loud action set ups but seriously utilize the talent you have guys. Character driven stories are what the Coen brothers are know for but True Grit is watery & perfunctory. It seems like this version was tailor made not for movie lovers but the short attention span crowd. Those that don't recall what they watch with any more enthusiasm than eating a sandwich & carrying on. Yet the approval ratings critically commercially & otherwise contradict that & its puzzling to me. This is a pay check to all involved & Oscar bait for the studio executives. I mean the ending of this infuriated me so bad that I had to get up & leave. Even without seeing the original it was badly written but aside from that this is Rooster Cogburn man! How they summed up his story was just disrespectful proving that the makers behind this remake truly not only have no understanding of the original story or story telling in general but clearly no grit what so ever.",2011
1,I haven't reviewed anything in a long time. I've seen some notably good and bad movies but this one has a lot to be said about it. I went to this movie with my boyfriend who is a big fan of western's. I'm not as much a fan but I enjoy a good old western shoot 'em up flick every once in a while. It did look interesting and it was a remake of a John Wayne film- How could it not be good? So I bit the bullet and tagged along not expecting much but hoping to be entertained. ,2011
2,"I consider myself a movie buff and have seen many a good western in my time . Sadly I feel this is not one of those movies . Instead of a long winded review, ill keep it brief. Bridges , you couldn't understand a damn thing that came out of his mouth. Brolin was on screen for the only ten good minutes of the film. Damon was laughable, and the girl had no character development so although her acting was good, her character was annoying. Now the story; you have the girl mouthing off the first half hour, then her and Bridges, and yes sometimes Damon frolicking across the desert for an hour and ten minutes. So that leaves about five minutes of the real story we've been waiting for. The ending leaves little or no closure. I found myself bored and restless during the movie. I also find myself wondering what drug everyone is on to find this movie so ""amazing"". Please save your money and go watch something else instead.",2011
1,What a stinker this film is. It was tiresome and painful to watch. Slow and boring.,2011

8,"I'll start off by admitting that I'm almost 19 and I look forward to watching this show whenever it comes on YTV. I understand that Victorious is designed for a younger audience, but let's be honest, it's easily one of the most quirky and just flat-out enjoyable nic shows out there. Yes it's a touch over-dramatic and can be pretty corny, but that's all part of the show's charm. It's like the love-child of Community, Glee, and one of the other nic shows like, I dunno, iCarly - and that, as it turns out, is a pretty killer combination. All of the cast members are so talented. From musicality to comedic timing, they've got it all. All of the characters are unique and interesting - particularly Cat and Sikowitz.",2012
10,"Dan Schneider you've done it again! this show is awesome, good cast, acting, jokes. like everything of this show is awesome! its good for teens, children, adult...like everyone. it doesn't have cheesy jokes and stuff. if your someone who loves drake & josh, icarly etc...well then your gonna LOVE and i do mean LOVE this show. everyone is talented in this show! you can see that its a typical Dan Schneider show. my rate for this show is 10/10,i got no flaws or nothing bad 2 tell about. its just to good! and plus they have some really good songs and amazing singers. like Ariana Grande(Kat) she has this AMAZING Christina Aguilera voice! but this show, OFF THE HOOK! hope it last long!",2011
10,"Unfortunately for me I didn't come across this show until the last regular episode aired. My niece watches it all the time and I finally sat down and watched it with her, and I liked it immediately. Likable characters, and funny story lines. My favorite characters; Jade, Cat, and Rex ( yes, the puppet ). I wish I had had a teacher like Sikowitz. I hope Nickelodeon changes their mind but it's highly unlikely, even though it's the most popular show they have right now, if I read correctly. I hope all the main characters go on to future success. Dan Schneider had yet another hit with this show, and I'm sure will have another new show out soon.",2013
10,I think I can make this comment short & sweet:,2010
10,"This is literally one of the shows you would like to watch after a hard and tiring day. It will not make you laugh out loud in every single episode especially in the first season,but it is relaxing and funny and the characters are really interesting and unique. Also,as the seasons pasted the comedy felt more effortless and it was improving,eventually making me laugh and smile through the episodes.It helped me through a difficult time by reminding me that you have to try hard for your dreams,respect your friends and even enemies and have fun in life. It might not seem that deep,but every single episode has some kind of moral and Dan manages to show little advices for kids and adults with his one of a kind amusing way,without the audience even realizing it. I am 18 years old and i love the music in it(even though i am more fond of the old rock/jazz type of music,but their songs work for this show perfectly),especially when Liz (Jade) or Ariana (Cat) or even better the whole cast is singing. It makes me want to dance and sing with them.The whole cast is incredibly talented and i am sure they have great futures ahead of them. Wish them the best! Btw,i hope Nickelodeon regrets canceling it and sees their mistakes now that the views on their current shows are getting lower and lower. 10/10 Because this show will always be in my heart, as one of my favorite teen shows!",2013
10,"Dan Schneider is really excellent in Creating Victorious he has chose the best actors to deliver the script perfectly, Victorious is hysterically funny and one of the best shows in nickelodeon and the actors deliver the script very perfectly when there is a really funny scene they try not to laugh and they always succeed, Victorious is inspiring people who want to be pop stars someday that anything can happen like what happened to Tori she did not expect to be a student of Los Angeles best acting school, Two thumbs up, Victorious is a funny show very entertaining, They should have 9 seasons because they truly make me laugh hard and such a shame many people hate it, but what matters is your personal opinion Victorious is truly Victorious.",2013
9,"This show is awesome. It's a goldmine of entertainment! It has the cutest character ever (Cat), the dumbest talent-hog ever (Trina), and the most cynical, sarcastic, and Gothic character ever (Jade). In one episode (The Bad Roommate), we find out that Jade likes to pick her nose! And you would not expect that from someone like her, cause she's so mean and hateful and never does silly stuff. But we know her secret now! It could be that's why she's in denial. I have to say though, when she did pick her nose, it was actually attractive! She's so beautiful, even when picking her nose! By the way: My fav character is Cat. She usually sooooo innocent but in the episode I just mentioned, she actually TWEETS about Jade's nose picking problem! I think it could have been pay-back for all the times Jade has been mean to her and others. Also, Trina is hilarious as well!",2013
9,"For those users who submitted a low review on Victorious, their expectations were most likely a little off. I don't know what they expected. As a 20 year old guy and long time Disney Channel and Nickelodeon fan, Victorious has been by far one of my favorite sitcoms. The humor in this show is geared towards the mid to older teenage audience, for both guys and girls. ",2013
9,"I like the show Victorious. I think it's a nice family show that most can enjoy watching. The script is usually quite witty and often it has includes some humor that all ages can enjoy. I think that Victorious is more enjoyable for people over, let's say, 13 to watch, than say iCarly. As for the characters and actors, Victoria Justice isn't a favorite of mine. She's clearly improved since the first season but I still find her character annoying and not likable. I end up relating and having more compassion to Jade (Liz Gillies) who's meant to be the mean girl that nobody likes. I think that Liz and Ariana really carries the entire show from time to time. I love Cat (Ariana Grande) as a character. She's very likable, cute and funny. Although I like the chemistry between Liz and Avan Jogia, Avan's character Beck I feel is very plain. Another funny character, played by the very funny actress Danielle Monet, is Trina who is Tori's crazy, untalented and unpopular sister who also ends up being more likable than Tori in the end (at least for me). I don't really pay much attention to the other characters like Andre (Leon Thomas) or Robbie (Matt Bennett) they aren't really the characters that bring on the most chuckles. Another quirky and funny character is Sinjin (Mike Reid) who plays this really weird character but still remains funny. Another mentionable character is the kids teacher Sikowitz (Eric Lange) that guy is hilarious! He's such a good actor!",2012
10,"I love this show! During the age where kids are obsessed with celebrities, this shows a high school where stars are made, making the trend relatable and fun! The show includes old favorites, like Victoria Justice, and talented new faces like Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande! Plus, the hit-maker Dan Schneider is the creator of this show, which is sure to make it a win! His previous shows have been hits in my book, and I'm sure this is no different. One thing I've noticed is that this show is probably for an older audience than iCarly, Schneider's other hit show, since the students seem to be older and one of the main characters, Beck, shared a kiss at least 3 times during the episode, all of them seemingly passionate. However, I have no problem with it, but I was surprised as Schneider normally steers clear of offending people, and we all know there are some overprotective parents out there! I can't wait for the rest of the season to come April 11, as this is a show I will definitely watch alongside my kids!",2010
7,"After launching his career as the creative force behind All That, Dan Schneider has gone on to create some of Nickelodeon and TeenNick's best and most well-known programs, including The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, and iCarly. His latest effort is Victorious, a Nickelodeon sitcom starring teen idol Victoria Justice. Known primarily for her supporting role in Zoey 101 and starring in the iCarly movie, iFight Shelby Marx, her first lead role in a television series finds her as Victoria ""Tori"" Vega, an easily likable high student whose talent is obvious to everyone but herself. After her naive sister is unable to perform at her art school's annual talent show, Victoria unwillingly takes the stage, wows the crowd, and, eventually leaves her ""normal"" high school to enroll at the fictional Hollywood Arts High School. From the very first day, it's clear: the transition will be a difficult one, thanks to the inherent irregularities that come with such a process, but ultimately necessary to achieving her lifelong dream.",2010
10,"Good messages about having confidence in yourself and following your dreams. There is also no talking back to adults in this show (although they make the adults such fools). The reason this show is called ""Victorious"" is because it's ""victorious"" in quality over all the other Nick shows. It is my #1 favorite show, next to Jessie (on Disney Channel). I wish the two had crossed despite being on separate channels though. I also think it was just plain stupid of Nick to cancel this ""victorious"" series, and replace it with crap such as Every Witch Way, The Thundermans, Bella and the Bulldogs (which I haven't seen the last one yet, but I have a feeling it will suck eggs).",2015
10,"Vitorious is the perfect show for teens that just want to laugh after a dull week. Victoria Justice (Tori) is meant to play her role, she's a great actress, and apparently a good singer too. Daniella Monet (Trina) is an awesome actress, she could have easily gotten the role of Rachel in FRIENDS if so ever she was born a couple of more years earlier, plus she's really hilarious. The extremely talented and cute Ariana Grande (Cat) fits her role perfectly. She's probably my favorite of all because of her ridiculous cuteness and great talent, or maybe because she was a Broadway star... The first time I saw Leon Thomas III (Andre) was on iSave TV on iCarly, even then I thought he was an awesome guy, and now on Victorious he seems even more awesome. Liz Gillies (Jade) can really put on the villain vibe and plays her character really well.",2010
2,"When I saw Drake & Josh for the first time, I laughed hysterically at some moments. When I saw iCarly for the first time, admittedly, I still found it funny. I watched Victorious today and not even a chuckle. But even though there are episodes of iCarly that are just as bad, I have to justify my opinion of Victorious with several crucial elements that set it lower than its predecessor.",2010
8,"The young and beautiful Victoria Justice from ""Zoey101"" knows how to take a lead. In her show as she lands a role in another Nick show called ""victorious"" Something that has not been seen on Teen TV show comedy's like Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly place,I Carley.This show is funny and entertains the audience to like it.It also has a very good cast and it feels like they get along with each other.it's truly the funnest teen show since""that's so raven"".judging from the pilot the acting is better than any Nick show currently on right now.I will continue to watch this show as it gets better and better. 10 out of 10 stars!",2010
9,"After seeing the first few episodes of this show I realized something, it's just like iCarly with a different cast at as different place. Same style of humor, same jokes, same writers, same creator, just with a different cast and place. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing, its actually a very good thing! This show is not laugh out loud funny (at least not for a teenage boy like me) but it is entertaining when nothing else is on. Personally I prefer Drake and Josh and iCarly over this so far, but hopefully during it's second season it hits it's stride. The highest point of the show is the star Victoria Justice. She's probably the funniest and most talented of all of the cast members (not to mention she's hot)!",2010
10,I found this show to be great! I loved all the characters especially Cat and Tori. I am 12 years old and I loved it! I've been watching nickelodeon for a long time and I've loved Victoria Justice since she was on Zoey 101 and I think its a must see for anyone who likes Zoey 101 and iCarly. In my opinion its the best show Dan Schneider has ever created. I even think this show is better than Disney channel's sonny with a chance. From now on I will watch Victorious every Sunday night instead of sonny with a chance.This is now my new favorite show. I think Cat (Ariana Grande) is the funniest one on the show! Tori (Victoria Justice) is also one of my favorites.,2010

9,"""VICTORIOUS,"" in my opinion, is an excellent Nickelodeon show. I watch it with my 9-year-old nephew from time to time. I always smile and laugh whenever a mishap occurs. I would have to that the funniest one is everything that happens when Tori (Victoria Justice) has to look after Trina (Daniella Monet). Another thing that makes this show funny is Robbie's (Matt Bennett) comic relief. If you ask me, she always know just what to say and do to make the audience laugh. The writing is always strong, the performances are always good, and everything else about the show is good. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that if you don't have basic cable, you should get it. Now, in conclusion, I hope this will be on Nickelodeon for many years yet.",2014

1,"This is yet another teen show put out by Nickelodeon, which seems to be trying to do nothing short of making itself Disney Channel Lite. Seriously, does every actress on every Nick show need a singing career? What's next, giving the VAs for Penguins of Madagascar and Fairly Oddparents recording contracts?!",2011
1,"I have watched Dan Schneider's shows since I was little. All That was great and then there was Drake and Josh which made me and my parents laugh out loud. Zoey was 'ok' and when Victoria Justice came in season 2 she was pretty but that was about it. Even iCarly has some hysterical moments, especially Sam and Freddie. So naturally, I thought this would be another home run for Mr. Schneider. What a horrible disappointment. There is nothing redeeming about this show on any level. The acting is terrible. The writing is anything but funny. The characters are shallow and meaningless. It makes me feel like the entire show is riding on Victoria's appearance which, frankly, can't carry a 30 minute show on its merits. This comes off like a 'poor man's Glee'. Maybe Schneider has past his prime of creating funny kids shows? If it has to, finish its first run but for God's sake, take it off the air and replace it with something watchable.",2010
3,I know all the Disney and Nick people want to keep pumping out fresh new stars on their shows...but please..this show won't be doing that. This is suppose to be a performing arts high school...yet none of the students really have ANY talents at all. Of course most of the adults are clueless and have no real wisdom to teach..they might be better suited to a mental ward somewhere. The main star...Tori Vega..is pretty and she is the ONLY one who truly seems normal..and she really did not want be thereto begin with...(I wonder why?)..but she got stuck going there because of her horribly untalented sister...who thinks she IS the next MAJOR star...guess what? EVERYONE knows she will never be a star...major or otherwise. How did SHE manages to get into this place? There are random other kids who all seem to have major issues of one kind of other too...one guy constantly carries around a ventriloquist's' dummy...which is freaky...one girl is angry all the time..dresses in black...and actually has a boyfriend who is a nice guy...someone r swho would be better suited for Tori...hmmmm...I wonder if THAT will happen at some point? Predictable...yes....entertaining...a little...annoying...oh yes...kids and teens love it...but I wish they would come up with something original to make a show about...stop repeating stuff that already has been done.,2010
10,"Victorious is good for what it is! This show may have had the fame concept too, but it was more about the crazy journey to fame. Meanwhile, thanks to Trina sometimes, we'd have jokes about people regarding the industry such as people not caring who wrote the song or how today talent has nothing to do with many people being famous. Tori Goes Platinum was definitely the episode that showed what life can be like in the industry and I believe it was done really well since we had seen such a different side to Tori that not even she was pleased with. And even after she performs at the awards, even after the times André has impressed a producer with his music, it's not happily ever after for them. They still have to work their way up or find another opportunity to get picked up by someone and I find that pretty realistic as it's been said that you really do have to keep working at it with your talents and keep practising and doing gigs. Unlike other fame shows, not only did this show a crazy journey to fame, what with this being by Dan Schneider, this also showed the process of becoming famous to be as realistic as it can be.",2013
8,"If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO's critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers"", change the channel",2010
9,"""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that. ",2010
6,"""Don't Compare it to Band of Brothers"" they shout!",2010
7,I enjoyed this series very much and can see why there has been so many comparisons with Band Of Brothers. My observation is that in The Pacific many of the characters lack depth and development. The result was that I cared less when ill befell them than I did in Band of Brothers. I think that the first episode could have contained a lot more time letting us get to know the characters better before throwing them into battle.,2010
10,"I am a great fan of the original Band of Brothers and do realize that some of us do not get the feeling of getting close to the individuals as we did with BoB. The Pacific theater was different. The Japanese warfare was, and I suppose still is, different. I do not believe that it is fair to compare Pacific to BoB. We are trying to compare Apples and Oranges. I think that this miniseries is a great piece of historical story telling. Having read some complaints about the historical accuracy of the statement made in episode 3. What a wonderful thing that there are people out there that know the real history. Is it not a good thing that this miniseries actually gets us involved? That some, if not most of us, actually go and try to learn more about what had happened? Is it not a good thing that we hear names like Basilone ( a real hero), E.B.Sledge, and Robert Leckie? Normal people that have performed and endured in an utmost,and admirable way. If this miniseries has the power in getting our younger generation interested in this part of our history, it has done a wonderful thing. I would recommend for anybody watching this series to go and investigate the facts, read and educate oneself about the soldiers that fought for our freedom and for democracy. The only negative thing about this series is that the episodes are to short and the 7 days between episodes is to long. To all the Veterans past and present, thank you.",2010
8,"I'm Australian and it's ANZAC day today where the whole country honours all those who have served our country and others in all theatres of war. I judge The Pacific as a dramatic representation of the war in the Pacific, not a 100% historically accurate documentary.",2010
9,"I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.",2010
6,"Granted, I'm only on episode 6 of 10, so take my review with a grain of salt.",2010
6,"I don't compare the heroics of the European war with those of the Pacific war, but I've always been more in awe of the Pacific War. Unfortunately, this miniseries seems an afterthought, as if, after Band of Brothers, a Pacific vet went up to Spielberg and said, ""Hey, what about us?"" and Spielberg said, ""Oh, OK.""",2010
8,"I saw the first episode tonight and the first thing your mind does is compare. We see similar introductions to surviving American Marines (that were showcased by members of Easy Company in ""Band of Brothers""). The landing on the beach invites comparisons with Saving Private Ryan. SPR was a far more elaborate and bloody landing scene. In fact what was anticlimactic for the whole of the first episode is the small amount of ground battle on Guadalcanal than is yet to come. The hour whizzed by so fast it was over before I knew it. The main characters are introduced and the story has its foundations laid. From the (limited amount) of what I know of the Pacific battles, they were very long and took a huge toll on both sides as one side fought with determination to dislodge the Japanese invaders and as they got closer to the homeland, the Japanese fought with ferocious tenacity to hold off the American's at all costs.",2010
2,"When the makers of Band of Brothers get back together (almost to a man) to make a mini-series about the Pacific Theater in WW2 and furthermore spend lavish amounts of money to ""get it right"", it's a 'can't miss', right? Well, instead what we got was a poorly scripted, mish-mash of a story that assumes everything, explains very little, and is so obsessed with soldierly angst that it leaves us not caring a whit about the main characters (much less the secondary ones we know nothing about).",2012
9,"After watching the first episode of ""The Pacific"" I have to say I was gripped. Now, it is important to realize one major thing about this series as compared to ""Band of Brothers"". This is bases on the real life memoirs of only three Marines who served in the Pacific Theather of the war, while ""Band of Brothers"" was based upon Stephen Ambrose's account of a whole company of soldiers.",2010
8,"HBO's ""The Pacific"" is an excellent show in it's own right. While many fans of the previous HBO war series ""Band of Brothers"" may have high hopes and anticipations that The Pacific will follow suit of its wonderful predecessor, sadly they will be disappointed. The first few episodes are story driven but by the midpoint of the show, all the action begins to come through and some, if not all the action sequences are stellar. In the end, the story itself is driven at a much slower rate and is more dramatic and the visuals of the war in the Pacific are both beautiful and chilling. This is where the show shines the most.",2010
5,"The show is OK, nothing more. Definitely not as good as BoB. Main problems I got with it: ",2010
10,"A lot has been said already about The Pacific. But still I like to add my opinion on this series. I watched The Pacific some years ago soon after watching Band of Brothers. I admit I was slightly disappointed, I couldn't identify with the characters, I found it difficult to keep track of the story lines, the ending was not very satisfying. Recently I watched the series a second time within two weeks. Surprisingly I was very impressed this time, actually I consider this series a better one than BOB. I think it is more realistic in that sense that warfare isn't adventurous or heroic at all. The picture is a grim one, it shows a more true face of war (which luckily I have no idea about at all!) than BOB I think, no glamour, no heroes, no humor, no reward, no victory, even romance is due to fail. This time the story was crystal clear to me and the ending logical. I recommend this series, with in mind that it will never be able to present an accurate view of the reality of war, but probably it comes close. It is very well acted, visually exciting and leaving you with a scary view of battle, it is as if only faith will keep you alive. Finally, the visual and sound quality is amazing in my opinion. One of the best scenes is when Snafu and Slegdehammer hate each others guts on Okinawa after surviving all previous battles together, there's no sense of comradery anymore, no heroism or victory, all that has left is trauma and frustration.",2014
6,"Some people say this shouldn't be compared to BoB but to be frank, it leaves you very little choice because it's the same packaging and delivery but instead of getting some quality product you are given a charred broken piece of junk... With that said, it does have it's bright sides, few as they are...",2010
7,"Overall this show is not bad. Id even say it is good considering. But is it great, no. The main problem this show had was character development which many of these other reviews point out. But you must understand why. In Band of Brothers (BOB), most of the soldiers were alive during filming, and remembered so much that they were able to give detailed descriptions of themselves and their friends fallen in battle. This series didn't have that luxury. Only 3 men depicted were still alive during filming. That makes it very hard to portray individuals accurately with no one able to recall how they acted. So instead, understandably, they went in a different direction and focused on the war. Of the 10 episodes, 9 had major battle sequences. BOB had only 7 episodes with such battles. 6 if you take away episode 6 Bastogne as it focuses on Doc Rowe and his problems getting medical supplies and the hellish cold those men went through. Not to mention the entire first episode of BOB was all boot camp for that much needed character development. In The Pacific, the first time you see the soldiers together its as they are shipping out for battle. I wont go on and on like some, but basically if you go in not expecting to care for the characters and to enjoy the reenactments of the battles you will like it. But if your a true critic, it will be only good at best. And thats to bad. Of course rumors are already circling for a 3rd installment focusing on Africa. Wonder if that will happen.",2010
2,"As a 20 year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Korean and 'Nam era, I'd first like to make a few points to the other reviewers. One, when referring to U.S. Marines, the word ""Marine"" is ALWAYS capitalized. Second, Marines are not ""soldiers"", they're Marines. The Army has soldiers.",2011
9,"I think some of the negative reviews below are misleading because they were written after only the first few episodes. I too was disappointed by this show early on (especially after the Australian episode.) But things began to change in episode 5 when they land on Peleleau. The sustained horror and carnage of the battle scenes are exhausting. There is no glorifying of war here. The effect of this hell on earth for the soldiers, especially Sledge and Snafu, are what this show is really about. You can't witness images like Snafu tossing rocks into the blasted skull of a Japanese soldier or an Okinawan mother with her baby getting blown apart by the bomb strapped to her stomach without deep psychological scars. The penultimate episode, located on Okinawa where hundreds of thousands of civilians were involved, is when the show reaches it's peak with the most harrowing battle scenes I've seen. This episode really showed what the Pacific theater was really about; a race war to the death. No quarter taken nor given. Sledge comforting the mangled body of the old woman who his mortar team may or may not have ripped shrapnel into will stay with me for a long time. The Pacific unnerved me in a way BOB or Private Ryan did not. And that's how it should be.",2010
7,"I know that it was inevitable that comparisons would start to be made to Band of Brothers because they were essentially created by the same team. But I kept telling myself it's a different series, different characters and a different war.",2010
5,"This miniseries just fell flat. And no, I'm not comparing it to ""Band of Brothers"".",2010
3,"First off I am a massive fan of the first Band of Brothers. The character development it presented as the series went on really drew you in, as a result you cared about them which is what made the tension of the series.",2010
2,"Band of Brothers represented a decent effort, despite many misrepresentations, to tell a detailed story of one unit and their accomplishments and hardships. HBO apparently , like the producers of the original Star Trek, decided to water down this story with love interests. Does this stuff really draw in more female viewers? Or are they aiming for very young viewers? Does anyone interested in a true war story want to be distracted with a lot of irrelevant background? Band of Brothers, as good as it was, only focused on one small unit on a vast battlefield, and there are a million more stories to be told about D-Day, much less the Pacific campaign. Now it appears these inspiring stories won't be told. Instead, we are going to have to learn about the sexual escapades of young soldiers. Do the producers realize that we have all had sex before, but we haven't stormed a beach in the Pacific theatre, and the details of such an operation would be much more interesting than the pick-up techniques of John Basilone? Speaking of Basilone, the depiction of his death was a travesty, it didn't happen that way, he was killed instantly by an artillery shell.",2010
7,"The common view amongst ""professional"" reviews is that the movie is average. scoring below 50% from Rotten Tomatoes, and MetaCritic, and notably a 2 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.",2010
6,"Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time is supposed to be based on the video games of the early 2000s, and it does have some of the elements from the games: parkour, time-shifting elements, etc., but the film version of the PS2 classic is closer to an average sword and sandal adventure than the magical, sprawling world of the video game.",2015
9,"Tonight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of this film. Like many, I became a fan of this franchise with the Sands of Time trilogy, and I was very excited when I learned that there were plans to make a feature film based on it. The storyline of the game is very cinematic (at least in the aforementioned trilogy, not necessarily in the previous games in the series) so I felt that at film adaptation would be an impressive epic.",2010
8,"First of all when I read some of the reviews about this movie all my excitement was drained but I went to see it anyway. What do you now, the movie was great. It was fun, had a lot of action in it, the CGI was nice (excecpt few scenes in the beginning). I thought acting was nice Gyllenhaal (prince) and Arterton (Princess) did a good job in my opinion. As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. OK it was not the perfect movie but it was something that I would go and watch its sequel.",2010
9,"Did you see Iron Man and Robin Hood? Yes? Well, this film is better, simply because the story is original. I know, I know, it is based on the computer game...which I used to play ages ago...but the story portrayed in the script is classic and refreshing at the same time; the performances are natural and the stunt scenes are unbelievable. Now, what did Iron Man 2 miss and this movie excels at? Plot, and a fast action pace without being over caffeinated big bang explosions (ever saw G.I. Joe?)",2010

9,"I didn't expect much from this movie, and wasn't planning on watching it after watching the trailer, which had somehow managed to butcher the action sequences which turned to be pretty good in the movie. It hardly depicted the movie for what it made out to be, so i'm more than glad that i did. At first glance Jake wouldn't be my first choice for the role of the prince as i didn't think he really looked the part, with his slightly goofy looking demeanor, but he made up for it as he certainly played the part(and thanks to the costume designer, dressed the part), coupled with a good body double the parkour wasn't far off either. There was good chemistry between the male and female leads, however, granted perhaps overplayed in less than idyllic moments for pda haha, which some might find cliché but hardly something to dwell on in this pretty awesome movie so its not as bad as other critics claim. It offers aesthetically pleasing graphics (as to be expected of the people who worked on the pirates of the Caribbean) and although deviated from the plot of the game, the important aspects blended well and made for an enjoyable, and not totally predictable storyline. Another epic jerry epic i say. I sincerely hope they make a sequel, especially if the the dark prince is involved in the storyline, that would be badass (magma cracks already showing on the prince's body during slow mo time travel scenes so fingers crossed)",2010
9,Prince of Persia was an immensely enjoyable movie. Below I list the positives and few negatives of the movie before summarising.,2010
6,"I tend to feel Prince of Persia the movie owed me a watchable story, after paying 140 Baht(more than average in Thai cinemas) and two unremarkable hours in the digital cinema. I also tend to doubt the possibility this movie will ever speak to you with any messages, should them be fairy tale messages or serious politic messages. That being said, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is quite a disappointment from a bunch of names I admired.",2010
8,"It isn't often that a video game is so vivid, so involving...so enveloping, that it is looked on as a possible movie franchise on all those merits. Usually, just the action (Doom, Final Fantasy), or just the body (Lara Croft...Tomb Raider) or just some other one aspect makes for a great game, but an underwhelming movie. I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an early screening on Monday night, and it is definitely a step above and beyond the aforementioned videogames-turned-movies.",2010
5,"The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from ""Beverly Hills Cop"" to the ""National Treasure"" franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as ""Enchanted April"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.",2010

10,"As a Prince of Persia fan i enjoyed this movie. The Park our scenes were stunning. There is a lot of Action in this movie which is in my view a good decision. If you are looking for a some good Swords battles you will enjoy this Movie. the different Assassins characters were also a interesting part of this Movie. I have to mention that Disney done a great job with the atmosphere Music in this Movie. I think Disney did a great job with this movie,at first i was very skeptical with Disney producing it. But with Pirates of the Caribbean and Prince of Persia I'm very satisfied with Disney's quality as a big blockbuster Movie Producer.

1,"Anyone still impressed by CGI after we've had Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and hundreds of other fairly decent films thrown at us needs to get a life. Please stop talking about how good the special effects are. Impressive explosions or magical events on the screen do not a Jedi make, or a good movie. Any good movie or film has two key elements, story and direction. In this case, you have no story and a very convoluted plot. The story is a made up fantasy based on a video game that is only partly successful. Strike one. Secondly, let us consider director Mike Newell and his mostly television career. The small screen is one form of entertainment. When you take an image and blow it up to seventy feet across, you'd better put something interesting up there, because people will see every detail. Unlike television that shrinks a world to sameness, film is an art form that examines details. A good director can use even limited actors and make something work. But a bad director will fall back on things like special effects to sell a bad scene. This film is an example of directing at its worst. The stumbling pace, the up and down tempo, the failed execution, and the poor acting I lay at Newell's doorstep. This film is about to lose about a hundred million dollars or more for Disney at a time when their Magic Kingdoms have seen dramatic fall off in numbers, and I would not want to be in his shoes when they start adding up the loses.",2010
1,"If I thought the overlong, frightfully dull ""Avatar"" contained and rehashed every Hollywood cliché ever used, albeit in blue, ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"" runs the gamut of every mindless Hollywood action-feature effect, computerized or not, and even as an admittedly escapism event, it falls short of any intended mark. It is obvious that there is little new under the Hollywood sun. Frankly, 1942's ""Arabian Nights"" did this plot line much better and Shemp Howard, of Three Stooges fame, surpassed Alfred Molina's deadly dull and ineffective attempt at humor. Jake Gyllenhaal, in spite of much daring-do stunts and macho posturing, is still not the virile stud hero that his handlers are trying to turn him into, and Arterton's clichéd bitchy dialog becomes tedious after 10 minutes. It's a shallow waste of time from beginning to end and how Ben Kingsley could keep a straight face throughout this loud, noisy romp is a testament to his enormous experience in front of a camera.",2010
7,"Prince of Persia is the BEST PLATFORM GAME on computer I ever played as a child. It's not that industrial standard movies can create new ideas, they have to find a source to make an adaptation, but Sands of Time doesn't stand enough loyal to its title. What not staying loyal to Prince of Persia means, there is not any visually admirable combat with the film at all. When it's been first released, AUTUMN 1989, in Apple II; there were only a palace, a peasant child, a princess under the Caliph's servitude and hundreds of guardians defending the palace. Our peasant child as a spy was there to rescue the princess to bring her back to father the Persian Emperor. Looking at the continuation of the game series, the story is taken back in time about 15 centuries back to Persian realm before the birth of Christ. When I played the 2003 Sands of Time game on X-Box, the combat sense of the game had been gone. It was rather boring and bothersome since our peasant has become a prince, with not much to do other than jumping back and forth over the house roofs like Spider-Man.",2010

Hopefully they won't stray too far from the storyline that they've set and allow us to see the progression of the cloned Super-Man Connor as well as Speedy or the Red Arrow, which will make this one of the best superhero action series since Super-Man and Batman.

However, as they have fleshed out this seasons story line and developed these new characters, I have liked the series more and more. Impulse and Blue Beetle have turned into some of my favorite characters, and the plot twists throughout this season have been absolutely incredible.

Season 1 began and ended exceptionally well, and despite the five year time Skip, Season 2 is just as good. While some fans criticize the five year time skip i believe it was necessary. Robin's transference to Nightwing, Zatanna, and Rocket coming in the league Kaldur going undercover in black manta's organization. All these changes are keeping the plot exciting , and interesting to watch. The show is currently on hiatus, but i cant wait till it comes back again in September. It left so many questions unanswered. What happen to L'gann? How is Artemis going to work for Kaldur? Hopefully these questions will be answered soon.

Only one character is somehow not fitted for long run (for me) that's ""Impulse."" He came from future to change it, he succeed but did not succeed and stayed in present. That's not working for me. He should not be stayed more than 2 or 3 episodes. Other than that show is awesome. Must watch the show. It keeps telling me to write more and more lines but i have said enough. If it insists i say it again, This is the best animated series. I just miss it. Waiting for the new season sooo badly.",2014
7,"Young Justice was a show that I was keeping up with for a long time, but have recently stopped. Keeping up with the show was tough, because it wasn't broadcast on Teletoon where I live, it went on numerous hiatuses, but I found a way. And I always found a way, because I loved the show.",2012
1,"I first saw the trailer of the show online after school one day,and when I watched the first episode of the show,I really liked it and saw great potential.But after watching the rest of the episodes and seeing all of the controversies about the show not being back on Saturday mornings,and then the show being cancelled and people saying that Young Justice is the best superhero animated show ever after 46 episodes,I gave up on liking the show because it now feels too overrated to me.",2017
1,"When it was on for its first time,I always loved to wait till every Saturday morning.After it was cancelled,I was really sad,so I decided to see what happens if I watched the show a billion times on Netflix,but as I got older, I realized it was just a overrated show, and dc fans say it is way better than other shows made by dc that I loved to watch when I was a kid.And as I am almost 20, I have given up on this show.",2017
1,"This show and teen titans go are the worst dc has ever made, The shows is for edgy preteens who think they""re ""tough"" or just are plain moody and annoying even the poster is filled with angry teenagers I mean jeez pop a smile once in a while you stupid emos. Also the faces of all the characters look they were either taken out of a toilet I mean the joker looks like a douche bane looks like a moronic thug and the rest are either eye sores or just bland and mediocre. The animation isn't that great especially when you compare it batman the animated series Superman TAS and Justice League it lack fluidity and raw energy that Batman TAS had. The writing is also bad and mediocre with cliché take over the world plots that have been in comic books since the dawn of time with no colorful story telling interesting character or any originality or creativity to make the bland plots and better. Go watch the original teen titans show, batman/superman tas, justice league, or justice league unlimited instead of this crapola.",2017
9,"To begin, this show is really two separate shows with the same title, such are the differences between the first and second seasons in tone and content. This is largely due to the ageing of the team and the absence of the Justice League for large parts of Season 2 leaving the team in a position where they have to step up.",2012
6,"This is not a horrible show, however I can't understand why everyone is praising it so highly. To me, it is a slightly better version of Teen Titans. For the record, I am not a fan of that show either. ",2015
5,"The title sequence- which has the members of Teen Titans, oops I mean Young Justice, turn and moodily stare out the camera- reveals the intent of this show. That intent, as with so many shows nowadays, is one of self-conscious coolness- coolness, emotional detachment and darkness.",2014
10,"Young Justice from the get go grabs you and reels you in. The characters all have the right amount of screen time and story behind them. The show makes you not only enjoy them but actually get behind them all. From Miss Martians identity issues and Superboys need for acceptance from his mentor to the relationship between Zatanna and her father. And that is just season one! Season two brings a host of cool ideas and relationships as well. The interaction between the characters and the stories are all a breath of fresh air. Especially for a show really for kids. However, it came out when I was in my late 20's. And growing up with Batman the Animated series and Superman the Animated series I was no stranger to good animation and cool story lines. And Young Justice does not disappoint in the slightest way. Every aspect of the show gets a 10/10. The stories, the characters, the action, the animation... all top notch. The only disappointing thing about the show is that it got cancelled. One of Warner Bros hugest mistake since they let someone make that Catwoman film.",2015
5,I tried out the show because of the hype. So disappointed.,2015
9,"Young Justice, it could have been a pathetic attempt at a kids show with superheroes, but it became an icon for everyone from 10 to mid 30s. ",2016
8,There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.,2010
10,"This is a biopic about how King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Widely considered by all but his father unfit to be king, George is reluctantly thrust unto the throne and into the spotlight after his brother is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little-known Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue to find his voice and courageously lead his people into the most devastating war humanity has ever faced.",2010
10,"I think I must have seen a different film from the previous two reviewers at Leeds on Friday. It is now two days ago and I am still feeling overwhelmed by what I saw. It is a very touching, and quite inspiring story about a man, psychologically scarred, and trapped in a situation from which he could have no escape and facing it with immense courage. It so happens that he was royal, and that was a large part of his problem- but the film isn't so much about royalty as a human story. The film conveyed very powerfully in the opening scene, the enormity of what was required of him. As the film develops, the complexities of the character are revealed. The acting is superb, especially from the three principals, and the development of the troubled and sparky relationship at the heart of the film is a joy to watch. The film is very funny and the characters have warmth and humanity. The film is well paced, and carries you along to the emotional climax, so that, even though I knew the story, it had me holding my breath. If you don't need lots of action or special effects in your film, and enjoy seeing top-notch actors at the very peak of their craft, this will be for you. You might also, as I did, gain a bit more insight into the human drama behind a significant, but relatively unexplored period of British history.",2010
10,"I rarely rate a movie a ""10"" but in this case, it is well deserved. Truly, there is no way to improve upon the achievement that this film represents, whether in casting, direction, writing, artistic value, you name it.",2010
10,"No spoilers here. I would like to let everyone know that this is an excellent film. I enjoyed it this week at the Mill Valley Film Festival in Marin County, CA. Given the outstanding cast and director, and my fascination with historical figures, I had high hopes for this film, though mixed with a certain resignation that I might be disappointed. There was no way I could have imagined how wonderful ""The King's Speech"" would be. There was abundant humor without the film ever becoming a comedy, drama without dreariness, and many deeply moving moments. I can't praise this film enough. It boosted my appreciation of the human capacity to become our best selves, and rise to meet even the most daunting challenges.",2010
9,"After seeing ""Apartment Zero"" after many years and being bowled over again by his amazing performance as the Argentinean pretending to be British, I felt the urge to see ""The King's Speech"" again - So glad I did. It was very moving to see Adrian Leduc being George VI. What an astonishing actor. In Apartment Zero he creates a character without a personality. A repressed, innocent that comes out as a total weirdo but we know better. His undeclared needs reflected in Colin Firth's eyes are a prodigious acting feast. In The King's Speech, his George VI suffers from a different fear but it's also pungently clear in the actor's eyes. I think what they both share is a desperate wish to be invisible. For King George that's an impossibility so, his struggle to move forward, learning to be the man everyone expects him to be is enormously moving. As you may have guessed, Colin Firth has become one of my favorite actors of all time.",2017
10,"I could write for hours about this film. I only just heard about it last night at a New Year's Eve party. Saw it today. To use the vernacular, OMG. Director Tom Hooper has a masterpiece on his hands. Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, all turn in excellent performances. Not to forget Guy Pearce as King Edward who abdicated his throne for an American divorcée. David Seidler's script is brilliant. The story is laid out cleverly. The pace and rhythm are PERFECT.",2011
9,"What a wonderful performance! Compassion and clarity of vision, side by side. Colin Firth has been a favourite of mine since the extraordinary ""Apartment Zero' (1989) His maturity as an actor reflects his maturity as a person and how many times are we able to say that? Very few I'm afraid. What I thought I saw in him as an actor playing the zero of the title in ""Apartment Zero"" is here in spades. Wow! How rewarding! Here he's not alone. Goeffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce are all standouts and the stutter is just a device to show a whole picture. How strange we knew so little about this man. I guess Hitler got all the headlines. So from a historical perspective is also a feast of sorts. Bravo indeed!",2011
10,"I saw this movie at Ryerson Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival among many other movie's this one really acquired my attention , wonder if it was for Colin Firth or Tom Hooper's writing. This is a moving tale about a king's obligation and deep friendship toward the nation he loved. The screenplay by David Seidler is genuine and clever... Colin Firth as the king is utterly dazzling and doesn't stop to amaze us movie by movie , like last year's A Single Man his performance has good chance to end at the Oscar race this year. Geoffrey Rush had one of the movie's well written role as the Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue , his acting is splendid! Tom Hooper did an remarkable work , every detail of the movie is memorable On the whole this movie is a bright , smart and impressive picture.",2010
7,"While his ascension to the throne of England seems imminent, future King George VI struggles with a speech impediment that won't allow him to speak in public without a fair amount of embarrassment to himself and his audience. He seeks and finds help by approaching speech therapist Lionel Logue who offers him his services. This Oscar nominee showcases some very entertaining and witty writing accompanied by excellent cinematography and acting. I don't however think the film is all that it is made out to be with the exceptionally high score it currently presents itself with on this website and roaring Oscar buzz. The story itself is quite thin and there aren't many memorable scenes that warrant a second viewing any time soon.",2011
10,"A longtime Colin Firth fan, I saw this wonderful film twice at the Toronto Film Festival.",2010
7,"King's Speech is one movie where the story takes a back seat and actors come out and perform. Though the movie belongs to Colin Firth but the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush are extraordinary. The prime reason behind such brilliant quality of performances is the screenplay. The story is dull but some funny lines/ situations here and there makes the movie a must watch. Above i have mentioned that the movie belongs to Colin Firth, the reason being not just his performance but the amazing consistency and hold of the character. Sparing one scene where Colin Firth cries in front of Helena Bonham, his performance is brilliant. I believe if things go well than Colin Firth is on his way to win the Oscar for best actor. The on screen chemistry between Colin Firth and Geoffery Rush is brilliant and some of the scene are really funny.",2011
8,"This is a beautiful and well made movie. The director has made the story of King George VI into something more interesting than just ""the story"". The movie starts with George as the duke of York, and follows his way to become king, and his difficulties with the stammering. George finds a therapist, Lionel Logue, who will become more than just a therapist. A true friend.",2015
6,"The award season brouhaha seems focused on Firth's performance, and excellent though it is, I find it less characteristic and affecting than his turn in Ford's 'A Single Man.' Like 'The Queen' from four years ago, the British royal family is again the boat on which Britain attempts to take Hollywood. But 'The Queen' was a far more affecting film. Perhaps this is because 'The Queen' was so much more enigmatic, while 'The King's Speech' obvious: the king's doll-like daughters greeting him with ""Your Majesty."" Need a more obvious way to communicate the king's entrapment? The cruelty of the Duke of York's brother. The footage of ""ordinary people"" wincing at the king's stuttering. The cheap suspense created by Bertie not listening to his recording of ""To be or not to be"" until much later. All these are formulaic, and Hollywood formulaic, employed because the the filmmakers seem afraid that we would not be able to empathize with the character's speech impediment problem. But by overdoing it, they achieve the opposite.",2011
10,"The title of the film wouldn't necessarily have caught my eye, but am I glad I went to see this film, courtesy of an advance screening. It was bound to be good with Colin Firth playing the Duke of York who went on to become George VI, and he didn't let the audience down. Let's not forget also the other main characters, Lionel Logue played by Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter as the Duchess of York, Michael Gambon as George V and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill - all absolutely perfect for their respective roles. Whilst the dates in the film might not have been completely accurate, the film tells the story perfectly, sometimes humorously and and certainly sensitively, and I would like to think in such a way that doesn't cause any embarrassment to any surviving members of our Royal Family or indeed people who suffer from what must be a very difficult condition to live with. Certainly a film I would recommend to my friends.",2010
9,"Wow! I just saw this at the Roy Thompson Hall (TIFF) World premiere of The King's Speech with director Tom Hooper (great job), Colin Firth (great), Geoffrey Rush (outstanding), and the writer (excellent job!) present. Front row seating was actually really good.",2010
7,"While the very idea of a stammering king is inherently interesting, as is the historical context of a gathering world war, the real substance of this movie is the interplay between two fine actors, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Firth gives a particularly rich performance, bringing his character to life with depth and subtlety.",2011
6,"In opening, I must say that everyone involved with this production did a solid job. They all did their duty. In that sense, the movie resembles the British royal family as a whole - they're not especially important really, but they perform a useful function that fate has assigned them to. The trappings of monarchy aside, I suspect that their lives are probably rather dull and largely scripted. That brief description of royal life and duty sums this movie up perfectly.",2011
6,"Two years after the decent but unremarkable ""Slumdog Millionaire"" got an Oscar, and a year after the even more unremarkable ""The Hurt Locker"" also undeservedly received the coveted statue, the Academy performs an even worse atrocity by denying The Social Network and Black Swan (among others) the best picture award, instead opting for ""The King's Speech"", a movie so obviously engineered to win a lot of Oscars that it hurts.",2011
7,"Alright, I'm probably going to receive an onslaught of thumbs downs for this review for simply not agreeing with the masses but oh well this is simply my opinion of the movie. ",2011
8,By a strange irony the film I'd watched at the cinema the previous night was 127 HOURS by Britain's most innovative director Danny Boyle whilst this evening's offering was THE KING'S SPEECH which had made in Britain plastered all over it . Boyle's film fails to a large extent because it's rather anti-cinematic where as Tom Hooper's film should fail down to the rather passé seen it all before feel that tries a little too hard tro appeal to prize ceremonies . If I was disappointed by Boyle's latest offering I was pleasantly surprised by THE KINGS SPEECH ,2011
4,"I really do not get the Hollywood's weakness for everything royal and British. It is enough for a British actor to play an English queen or king to get nominated, it seems. For example Helena Bonham getting nominated here is just ridiculous, she is good of course but nothing deserving an Oscar nomination. The film is well made and acted, but is basically a lie, sentimental and simplistic one at that. King Edward VIII, the older brother here, was a known supporter of Hitler but the film does not mention it here. King George's speech impediment was not really so important, because the king's role was pretty limited at the time and his importance was little compared to prime minister's Churchill in preparing the country for war. Big deal that he was stuttering, he could have been mute and it still would not have changed much! The film also conveniently ignores that king George was NOT Churchill's supporter and thought his politics of clearly opposing Hitler was incorrect, instead he showed strong support for Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement, even after Chamberlain had cynically approved in Munich Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia! If it were up to king George, Churchill would not have been appointed PM, Halifax would have. And Halifax was just another Chamberlain. So the film is a sentimental lie for naive, sentimental public.",2011
4,"Eh, this movie didn't suck. It had funny parts and Helena Bonham Carter was a delight. That being said, it felt like a movie in a box. All the characters were more or less Hollywood stereotypes (over emotional protagonist, ""unorthodox"" aid to the protagonist, supportive wife, harsh father, wimpy priest, etc), and it made no real endeavors to be anything special. It's one of those motivational movies that's supposed to make you believe in yourself or whatever.",2011
10,"I did not expect much from this show at all. Some friends were watching it and I just caught a few minutes. One night I got bored and noticed that it was available on Netflix. I was hooked from the first five minutes, and I finished watching every single episode within three days. People say that the humor is similar to American Pie, but I disagree; it is more fun by far! The characters are perfect, and the actors have done a magnificent job. The jokes, the scenes and the actors together make this show the funniest I have watched in ages. I could not stop laughing. All I can say is that if you have a sense of humor and a love for stupidity in all shapes, you will love this show. I was really surprised, in the best way possible! Enjoy!",2012
10,I am a TV lover. I'm into everything and its not often that a show gets me as excited about seeing it again and again and again . really !! this show has got to be the best TV series i have ever seen to date and I've seen a lot. i cannot believe that spike decided not to launch a 4th season. if there is any chance of the show been brought back to life it would make my life a hole not better. this show has given me so much laughter even when things are bad i look to the watch BMS and by the end of one single episode i have a smile and feel great. this show was and is the best TV show i will ever see. please bring it back !!!(please),2012
10,"Slap stick simple comedy that brings about all the joys of college. Its really a shame this show got canceled while ""reality"" TV continues. Probably one of the best sport shows ever for comedy. The supporting characters changed a lot, but that was great because it provided a dynamic environment for the comedy. Guest stars were great, seeing Chad Ochocinco and the Captains ceremony made me laugh out loud. I do wish they had a few more actual football scenes, but maybe the actors weren't athletic enough. The show probably lack in the female audience as it was very much geared towards guys with all the themes, but a great guy show it was. All in all though a great show.",2012
9,I came across this show when I was flipping through the channels just this past Tuesday. I was on the floor laughing my butt off before it was halfway through. Afterwards I watched the rest on the spike TV homepage and just couldn't stop laughing. This show is awesome and I love the acting by the main guys. I used to watch Darin Brooks on Days of Our Lives and just thought he was amazing and with this show he has taken it to a whole new level. I also remember Sam Jones from Smallville and think he is just so talented. I forgot the other players name but he is too funny. So glad it was renewed for another season. Now instead of wondering what to do with my Tuesday nights I will definitely tune in to this show. It has by far become one of my favorite comedy's to date.,2010

Your always laughing and its just right crazy, and the stuff they do is just ridiculous. Cant wait for the movie wonder how its gunna go. actually watching it right now and its just a roller coaster of wickedness. id have to say my favourite character would be Moran, hes pretty funny and hes usually chill 'bout everything. i guess thads alright hes pretty funny too.",2015
10,"This is a hilariously, sometimes over the top, show. The first few episodes i was almost crying from laughing too much. The way that the writers of this show contrasts the characters, allows for most times a hilarious joke to form from what would most times be unavailable. I would definitely say that the show is a mix of Van Wilder and American Pie. It brings back the hilarity from both and amplifies it. The first season takes you through the beginnings of getting on a team, from the initiation hazing, partying, and then with bowl games and rivalries with other schools. If you haven't seen this show, don't knock it until you try it.",2010

Annyway this is incredible and I was amazed of the characters being so cool and well played. If it's worth anything i highly recommend this to anyone, and for those who are in college and don't have that much fun, learn from it, you will have the time of your life.

Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time.

The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story.

My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them.

I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",2010
10,"Is ""Toy Story 3"" good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. ""Toy Story 3"" is an excellent movie for all ages.",2010
10,"Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.",2010
10,"Well, this lived up to the hype, which usually isn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.",2010
10,"So I saw Toy Story 3 tonight at an early screening here in Houston, TX. A little background info about me. I am a big, no HUGE, Pixar fan, I've watched every film that they have created dozens of times. Let me begin, this is definitely no Ratatouille, Wall-E, or Up. Pixar is definitely coming back to it's family roots and Toy Store 3 is extremely evident of that. Don't get me wrong, Pixar has completely outdone themselves once again offering a film that is extremely entertaining, thrilling, and fresh, but it is kind of disappointing that the film doesn't reach any true depth until the POWERFUL last act.",2010
10,"Toy Story 3, perhaps the best animation made in cinema history has been, because after seeing this animation, each viewer feel that the characters of interest. The animation really neutral in terms of content and is unique. When you see that, like see professionals movie.",2010
10,"I liked very much the other ""Toy Story"" films, and I loved all the Pixar films, finding all to be clever, well animated and with a good message for the children.",2010
10,So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it. Now.......................................what are you waiting for?,2010
10,I am 52 years old and have seen an embarrassingly huge amount of movies over the past 45+ years. Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies I have ever seen.,2010
10,"I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.",2010
10,"Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.",2010
10,"Just how good is ''Toy Story 3'', you ask? It's simply one of the greatest achievements in movie history, I answer. This film, right now, should win the Oscar for Best Picture, hands down. I honestly doubt there'll be a better film than this all year. That's how absolutely brilliant this movie is. Pixar is officially king of everything! This movie is smart funny, thrilling, engaging, and, most importantly, it taught me about friendship. It taught me to stick by my friends, no matter what. The final sequences of the movie are absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears. It doesn't feel like you're watching an animated movie. In some scenes it feels like you're watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, due to the great thrills, and others you can't help but cry over due to the togetherness of the whole gang. One of the film's themes is obviously never give up. This film can really inspire you. This film is also about loss and letting go. Who knew a film about toys could have such true themes on life. This is a masterpiece, one that once again pulls you in with the characters from the second it starts. Don't go see the grotesque Adam Sandler comedy ''Grown Ups'', or the action flick ''Knight and Day''. Go see this. This film is about a quintillion light years better than both those films. This beats, as great as they were, the first two ''Toy Story'' films. It beats them by a lot, actually. Take your family to go see this, but also, if you're an adult, go see this with adult friends. This is a film to go see with friends. This is the best from the greatness that is Pixar. 10 out of 10, a miraculous, comedic, inspiring, joyful, entertaining, adventurous, smart, tear jerking, and enduring film to cherish until the end of time.",2010
10,"I randomly wonder if the Toy Story trilogy created any hoarders, because if I were a child and saw these films, I'd become a hoarder—just sayin'.",2010
10,"I went in with HIGH hopes and i was not disappointed! The first toy story movie was by far my favorite movie as a child, i literally watched it two or three times a day. Im emotionally attached to the toy story movies so this movie felt like the closing chapter to my childhood. Aside from my emotional attachment this movie was still amazing! I laughed, which is expected since its the all might pixar. But i also cried...i was kinda embarrassed haha. I was holding back the tears in this one scene but since i don't want to spoil anything so ill stop there. But by the end of the movie i couldn't hold back and instead of watery eyes i was in full tears haha. Everyone should watch it!",2010
10,I went in to the movie cinema to see this film with high hopes and expectations judging by the first and second films' brilliance and must I say that I was in no way disappointed and can actually state that this film is the best of the trilogy. These 2 movies were my favorites as a small child. When I say that this is the best of the three I bid no demotion of the standard of the first and second installments. I applaud Pixar on maintaining their perfect record.,2010
10,"I've seen a lot of disappointing three-quels in my days. Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, X-Men 3, Rush Hour 3, and much more. But this movie is not only a great three-quel but it could be the best three-quel of all time. Everything in this movie is excellent and I mean everything! It is dark, hilarious, clever entertaining, colorful, amusing but most of all it is very emotional, especially at the end. Thankfully, I did not cry on the outside but I cried a lot in the inside. Toy Story 3 is unforgettable and I am sad that there will never be another toy story movie but unfortunately it had to be ended. What a way to end a perfect movie and, I believe, the greatest trilogy of all-time. I am begging every single person to go see this movie instead of some crap like Prince of Persia, robin hood, the A team, or especially Jonah Hex. This is the best movie of the year and is the best movie of the decade... so far.",2010
8,"Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone, I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town, which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that, the film is also about the leader of the group, played by Ben Affleck. ",2011
8,"To say that The Town is everything Takers tried to be and failed at would actually be an insult to Ben Affleck's latest film. Mentioning that bland rehashing in the same breath would imply they even exist on the same plane, but the honest truth is this gritty Boston crime drama is something special and the best film of the early fall season.",2010
8,"Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" succeeds, so does ""The Town."" Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on ""The Town,"" however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.",2010
8,"My Oh My how Ben Affleck has had a up and down career. Starting out as the cheesy yet funny guy in those Kevin Smith flicks, to the academy award winning writer of ""Good Will Hunting"", all the way back down to the pathetic string of acting he produced only 10 years ago. But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and his much improved acting in ""Hollywoodland"". Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.",2010
1,"""The Town"" is an overrated, hyped-up, cheesy piece of junk, imo. It's more like a feature- length, made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie, and is very cartoonlike with a poor to mediocre cast. None of the characters are believable except for Jeremy Renner's role as the crazy ""Jem"" Coughlin, and Jon Hamm as Adam Frawley, the FBI Agt. who's been assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and to prison, once and for all. ",2014
8,"A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug (Affleck) has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go, to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise, they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town. ",2010
9,"I was wrong about Ben Affleck. I never believed that Affleck was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.",2010
6,"I react with some measure of disappointment to Ben Affleck's newest feature, The Town. Starring himself, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, 2009), and Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, 2008), this crime-heist thriller is set in Charlestown, Boston, where every other day there seems to be an armed robbery happening. Produced by Graham King, who won the Best Picture Oscar for Scorsese's The Departed (2006), which is also set in Boston, The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.",2010
9,"Last night I saw the sneak peek of the Town. Driving for 30 minutes and waiting in the huge line to get into the theatre I thought to myself, this film better be worth it. I can tell you now, I was not disappointed. This film delivered in so many ways. Ben Affleck surprised me again with his screenplay, directing and acting, showing me that he is a force in this world. The rest of the casting was brilliant as well. Jeremy Renner was breathtaking as Gem, playing the troubled and hardened career criminal. Blake Lively stunned me as Krista. I did not think she had the skill to pull off such a character and she delivered in all of her scenes. Pete Postlewaite has some amazing dialogue and is frighteningly amazing in his role. Overall this movie absolutely delivers because of the emotional content that allows the audience to become attached to the characters, and the amazing action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. All in all, I must say that this is one of the best films of the year.",2010
5,"This movie follows a well-traveled road: weary criminal wants to change life and meet a girl who might push him in the right direction. Obviously, only a ""last job"" stands in the way to living happily ever after.",2010
2,"Did I watch the same movie as most reviewers? Is it that people are expecting too little from mediocre actor so they are ecstatic when he doesn't do complete rubbish? Since The Town is on most bank robbery movie lists I should say that it is not a bank robbery movie, and it's not a thriller. It's a weak love story with bad Ben Affleck's performance packed in story about robbery and Charlestown, the neighborhood with high number of robbers. ""My dad was one, and so am I"" kind of thing. It's a movie about nothing with too much things going on. The same things that couple of minutes later are completely forgotten and the story goes on like some of them never happened. It has some great masks (different one for every occasion), but it seems that masks are there to make people pay no attention to weak action sequences and lack of tension. And even if we forget all about action and tension, we are left with bad love story. The movie is also too long and it seems that Ben got lost somewhere towards the end. ",2012
5,"Ehhh help me out here was this a remake of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" from 1995? ",2010
8,"I had a trip to 'the town' last night and well, it is surprisingly entertaining. I still can't believe Ben Affleck can pull off everything (story, screenplay, direction, starring in a lead role) with such an ease. Three years after his debut directional venture 'Gone Baby Gone', Ben comes up with an ever better one this time.",2010
1,"Typically movies do not make enough of an impact on me that I feel I need to comment. ""The Town"" however is certainly one of those movies. How a movie like this can be made without a ton of money being exchanged between the writers of the original work and the plagiarists who reconstituted a couple of old script's is beyond me? This movie simply combined the plots of two previous made Hollywood movies entitled ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"", packaged it in a different city, Boston instead of Los Angeles, and added the dreadful acting and directing of Ben Affleck. I just wish I could get my money back for having paid for this awful movie. After all, I've already see ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"" dozens of times and like them both. I'm not going to rehash the storyline but I do want to point out a few things that particularly annoyed me about this movie. The first is the part is the rip from ""Shawshank Redemption"" where she dug up the bag of money. This scene worked so magnificently in Shawshank because you desperately wanted the characters to end up in Zihuatanejo as free men. When the female character in ""The Town"" dug up the bag, I was hoping she would give it to the authorities so they could expedite the process of tracking down the thug murderer who buried it there and throw him in the electric chair. In other words, I didn't find any of characters sympathetic, compelling or likable. Second, are we really supposed to believe a successful, single, very good looking woman would fall for an uneducated, ruthless killer thug from Southie? Really? Finally, in this day and age of ""CSI"" and ""BONES"", are we supposed to believe Affleck's character is just going to lay low in Florida for the rest of his life? That final scene was almost as ridiculous as the part where he was working out. What was that? Was that some sort of dare between he and his Hollywood buddies to have a comparatively and equally lame scene like the one in ""Top Gun"" when they are playing volleyball? If you have not seen this movie yet, save yourself the time and money.",2010
5,OK I was personally a big fan of Gone Baby Gone. This movie was exactly like the movie Heat but instead of Al Pacino we have Jack Hamm and instead of Deniro we have the Affleck. This obviously is a huge step down. I mean it wasn't terrible but it surely wasn't great. In this movie(and come to think of it all Affleck starring roles) Ben has as much depth as a kiddie pool. He has the exact same facial expression during the entire film. The action scenes were good but that really didn't save it. And also not as many good actors. We are substituting Tom Sizemore for some fat Irish guy. Come on Think what you like but I know if you wanna see how this movie should have been see Heat.,2010
4,"Come on! 8.4 out of 10??? And it is being compared to Snatch or Lock Stock??? Who are you people??? First of all, there are so many flaws that I even felt uncomfortable watching. You go to a laundry room just to check out the chick you had kidnapped and miraculously, she starts crying and then talks to you, and then accepts to go out with you (a stranger) and then falls for you ('cause you are so irresistible). Right. Just like that. It's so simple, isn't it? Piece of cake, Ben. After FBI knowing that the chick is dating the suspect, there is no surveillance on her, nor her house.... nothing! Instead of waiting for them to get together and catch him at the end, they go to her place and play that typical stupid scene, with her giving him the hint not to show up. And the FBI dude is SO smart that he gets it and takes all his men away. Also, the second robbery, what a coincidence that the fourth guy shows up at the last second on that street and saves them... And all that time spreading the gas and moving bags of money, no police officers shooting at them, no other cops show up from the other streets, no helicopters..... Right. And what a great gesture that right after he tries to find out the truth about his mom with his dad, the flower guy starts giving him all that gratuitous information and tells him the whole story. Of course, because that info is not going to make him mad and make him want to kill him, it's just going to make him scare.... In the third one, they get out of the building alive dressed up as police cops, and Ben watches how they surround and kill his friend until the last second, instead of just disappearing himself. Right. Oh! And he gets out of there in a police car, nicely and smooth. Nobody thinks it's weird that the police car is leaving right after a crazy shooting. And not only that, but he is such a very good person, that he leaves all that money to that chick that he just met what, a month ago?? Right. Just like in real life. And how did the police know it was them in first place, if they left nothing behind from the beginning?? Ahhhh. So much absurdity. What's up with Ben showing us his abs while doing pull ups?? Everyone is doing so in all movies now... Wow, how cool, eh? Even George Clooney has that scene himself. I think it's an OK movie to entertain yourself for a bit, with some decent action but nothing memorable or great about it. I feel sorry for all those who think it's the best movie of the year. Hahaha. They have obviously never known any better. I am being nice giving it a 5.",2010
8,"In ""The Town,"" Ben Affleck plays Doug, the brains behind an Irish mob that robs banks and plans heists all around the Boston area. After their last huge bank job, Doug learns from his colleague, James (James Coughlin), that the female bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) from the bank lives a few blocks away from where the mob meets. This is when Doug decides to investigate Claire and see what she knows about him and the other members of his crew. Along the way, Doug falls in love with Claire as the FBI is slowly investigating him and his fellow mob members to see where they are going to strike next. It's only a matter of time before the FBI comes after Doug and it's now up to Doug to decide whether it's the mob life or love....",2011
4,"Many people seem to love Ben Affleck's The Town. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by that. I mean we do live in a society in which almost all our popular culture is fake. Fake ""reality"" shows flood our current television channels, the music business is full of fake posturing and overly manufactured acts, and Hollywood keeps filming the same old stories with bad writing, big star names, and lots of glitzy glamour. All flash and very little substance seems to be the trend of the day, or should I say decade? Well The Town is not much different, it too is a well polished turd. A turd that lacks pretty much any originality at all. The dialogue and overall quality of writing in this film should easily be surpassed by the average tenth grade student if challenged. Seriously, is there a single stretch of 10 minutes in this film that actually seemed like it could, or might be able to happen in reality? I've been around. From the big house to the white picket fence to the bad side of town and I'm telling you that no, there is nothing real. Nor is there anything meaningful here. This basically seemed like a badly written cartoon made into an even worse film. None of the characters who are given time to develop are anything more than cartoon like. Has the majority of people these days lost all perspective on what is realistic, and what is a total sham? It certainly seems so.",2011

9,"""The Town"" is a real crowd-pleaser in which some exciting action sequences are complemented by quieter passages during which a romance develops in very unusual circumstances.

10,"I saw the previews for this and thought this was going to be one of those slapstick stupid comedy movies (Superbad, Super Hero Movie). I came on IMDb and saw the rating and the reviews and I thought I'd reconsider after doing some research on this. I was very wrong with my initial assessment. Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing. It's clearly geared at a older teen/young adult audience and is rated R, what did you expect. In closing, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.",2010

Aaron Johnson did a good job playing the lead role of Kick Ass and I thought Nicolas Cage was good at playing Big Daddy as it wasn't the typical Cage film. This movie beats a lot of those stupid high school movies and chick flicks that are trying to be funny but fail. This is a great combination of bloody action and comedy.

Also, the only superhero movie where the GOOD guys are more perverse than the actual bad guys. I know this is based on a comic book, but i'll wont bother to read it, i doubt it covers all the plot holes. Did i've said that the 11 murderer kills people who are already down? Or what about the super-smart Big Daddy making idiot moves when the bad written plot demands? The characters have no life, the only reason to be there is to make pure, cold violence. I had to stop the movie several times, thinking why i'm still watching this? DAMM WATCHMEN was violent too, but it gave a hard atmosphere and background. It shows how to make a 'real life' superheroes thing. Kick-ass, in it's colour dandy world, only shows how it is cool to kill people with cool moves, and dropping blood on the screen is cool too. So kids, go buy a comic and learn how to Kill people. There's even a scene where the camera go on First Person mode... like an video game! Don't let your kids wacth this.

1,"I'm really starting to loose faith in the American audience. While the premise of this film is very promising, this movie is absolute garbage. Kick Ass fails because the movie doesn't know what it wants to to be. Is it supposed to be a comedy with action, or an action movie with comedy? The answer to that question, however, is that it is neither. The movie fails because it tries to be both and ends up ruining the basic elements of either genre. The parts that were supposed to be cool were mixed in with comedy that completely resets the tone. I'm not saying that action movies cannot have funny parts, but the way in which this movie does it is all wrong. I can say so many bad things about this movie, but then I would end up writing a book.

After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. ",2011

And i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year.

When it comes to Horror films, there are always the same Horror formulas which film makers really can't escape when making a Horror, because there aren't much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula. So Insidous borrows many of its ideas from other Horror films, one comes to mind is 1982 film "" Poltergeist "", but here we have a family of 5, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl. after a slow build up, a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems !! soon after, weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house !!

And also, does anyone agree with me when I say the music was absolutely outrageous and over the top. Thats what I meant when I said they were trying too hard to scare the audience.

I am one who enjoys the simple things in a horror movie and I think that is what makes them scary, but I feel like too much was thrown in for no reason. I have watched a lot of horror movies in my life and this is up there with the worst of them. While I was in the theater an angry movie watcher stormed out very upset about how bad this movie was.

8,"The experience of watching ""Insidious"" is a great one. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell have put together a fun ride for horror fans and those who like to be scared. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are very solid as the two leads and the supporting actors (including Whannell himself) do a fine job as well, amplifying the drama and providing welcome bits of humor. The only downside to the film is that a few aspects of the third act should have been toned down a bit and left to the imagination. Overall though, ""Insidious"" is a great, creepy film. It's refreshing to watch a horror film full of genuine scares, practical effects and that has an ending that's just downright chilling. It should be very interesting to see what Wan and Whannell do next.",2011

Then the guys who were in Michael Jackson's Thriller made an appearance and we got a shock ending that was obvious and silly. The most frightening part of Insidious is that we will likely see a part 2. I am not sure whether it was meant to be a horror film or a comedy and can't really be bothered to care.,2011

But first, I'm always surprised to see people reading the novel, rushing to the movie, and then expressing disappointment with remarks such as, ""there are gaping holes."" A 2-hour movie is a 110-page screenplay, which means a 300-page novel becomes a 6-hour miniseries. Get Martin Scorcese, hire ""Never Let Me Go"" novelist Kazuo Ishiguro to write the screenplay, and cast it right, and you'll have a shot at making a miniseries that CAN be compared to the novel; otherwise, let's understand the limitation and let the film stand on its own. I didn't read Ishiguro's novel, and I found Mark Romanek's film (screenplay by Alex Garland) to be a beautiful, profound and complete meditation on life. It demonstrates the best and worst of human behavior, the beauty of undying love, and the heroism of accepting responsibility (or fate in this case). To me, the story is uplifting and memorable, in spite of its overall sad and melancholy tone. What's more, it's seamless, from the superb performances by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, to the near perfect direction by Romanek, to its gorgeous cinematography with muted color palette, to its precise wabi-sabi production design (the beauty of worn and broken things). But how can you know if you'll like this film or not?",2010

7,"I had read the book and loved it. But this movie isn't for just anyone. I went to the sneak preview last night and there are always people who go to ANY movie because it's free -- those people hated this movie. My rant is it is their responsibility to do a little homework about a movie -- don't just go because it's free! That said...what a beautiful film. The visuals are something you will remember, the acting is superb, the cast (the kids as the young students and the older kids), the horror of ""the secret"" and then the unveiling of the reason for ""hope"" they cling to. One of the best reasons to see this movie is that you will need to think about topics you have not ever grappled with before. Your memories and opinions of this movie should be haunting and unforgettable. It is not a happily-ever-after film and is quiet, slow, and deep. The music is wonderful.

Romanek's haunting imagery combined with some great acting acting really make this film work as a great adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's still greater book of the same title. While the pacing may be a bit uneven, a moving story with a purposeful emotional disconnection holds together quite nicely on the silver screen.",2010

An appreciation about life could come out of watching ""Never Let me go"". Life is short, and it is a gift that should not be taken for granted. The characters life was planned out for them, but the short moments and small things were appreciated, especially the short romance between Kathy and Tommy. I felt especially drawn to Kathy's character. Although she had a calm and quiet personality, her strength was felt throughout the movie. Overall, very heavy, serious and melancholic movie, but also very beautiful story in it's own unique way. I would highly recommend this movie, you won't be disappointed.",2012
9,"It is not often that you come home from a film feeling both defeated  and genuinely happy. While these would appear to be contradicting  emotions, that is exactly how I felt coming from Mark Romanek's Never  Let Me Go. The film, written by Alex Garland and based on the novel of  the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro, is beautiful and emotionally  devastating at the same time.  The film opens in the 1970's, focusing on the lives of three school  children in an English private school. Although at first sight the  setting appears normal enough, we quickly discover these are not normal  children, as they exist solely to have their organs harvested once they  become adults.  Never Let Me Go seamlessly combines period drama and science fiction.  The alternative reality we are shown is never fully explained nor needs  to be. The film is purely about the three main characters: Kathy, Tommy  and Ruth. It is the film's deep focus on the emotions and personalities  of the characters that makes it fascinating. The world they live in is  simply there--reality for them--no explanations needed.  A film as personal as this relies heavily on the actors; and without  their strong performances the film would have fallen flat. An  Education's Carrie Mulligan stars as Abbie, a girl who does not act but  rather observes. Andrew Garfrield plays Tommy, who Kathy has been in  love with since they were children. Keira Knightley is provides the  most surprising performance as Ruth, who jealously falls for Tommy.  Fortunately, no one disappoints, in fact, they all exceed expectations.  As these characters are shielded from normalcy, the performances we get  portray them as innocents. This is especially true of Andrew Garfield,  who plays Tommy as a naive, innocent teenager who wants nothing more  than to live longer than he is programmed to. It is his performance  that stands out, it is understated, but still emotionally heart  wrenching.  The difficulty in reviewing this film for me comes from the emotional  impact it had. Many films will tug at the heart strings, manipulating  the audience into feeling a sadness that is not real. This film does  not manipulate, it has a genuine sadness at its core that leaves you  devastated. No film has left me on the verge of tears as much as this  one has. In an age of formulaic films, it is utterly refreshing to see  something so genuine on screen, even though the characters' situations  are foreign to the audience.  Alex Garland has often been criticized for his inability to write  logical conclusions to his films. While I personally don't agree with  that, Never Let Me Go proves that wrong. The final act of the film  doesn't try to trick us into feeling for the characters as we already  do. The characters reunite after years apart from each other; now,  closer to the end, they spend what could be their last days together.  There is no twist to the film, it ends exactly how we know it will, and  that is where the sadness comes from. We know the fates of these  characters, and the films' focus is on their struggle to accept their  fate just as we have had to.  Mark Romanek is a veteran music video director, and Never Let Me Go is  only his second feature film, although you wouldn't know it. Romanek  shows a maturity and patience behind the camera that is not only rare  for young filmmakers but for veteran ones as well. His use of focus  leads to one of the most beautifully shot films of the year, if not the  most.  Never Let Me Go is without a doubt my favourite film of the year, so  far. It had the emotional impact that I usually judge a film's quality  on. The fact it is not being talked about more is truly a bewildering  shame. I fear it will be forgotten, as dramas that do not garner Oscar  attention usually do.",2010
9,"""Never Let Me Go"" is an interesting, haunting and affecting story of love and jealousy. The story that we see occurring on the surface is fairly commonplace of friends growing up together and falling in love.

8,"In general, adaptations of prestigious or well-loved books are hard to pull off. Not only do film-makers feel the pressure to uphold their source's reputation, but they must also imbue the movie version with their own vision, their own style and personal touch. For director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland, Never Let Me Go must have been as daunting a challenge as any: considered by many to be among the best books of the past decade, Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian, coming-of-age drama features the sort of quiet, intimate power that rarely translates well to the screen. Much of the story and characters is revealed through narration, and the action is so subtle that, if it had not been crafted with such grace and skill, it would have felt static, almost nonexistent. However, Romanek and Garland face these obstacles head-on and, with the help of a talented cast and crew, defy the odds by making a film that - in spirit, at least - stays true to the original source and still succeeds on its own merit.",2010

It tells the story about Kathy H, Tommy D and Ruth who becomes close friends during the late 1970s while living at Hailsham, an unconventional boarding school in East Sussex, England where the teachers encourages their students to focus their attention on creating artworks rather than learning maths and science. Like most of the other students Kathy H, Tommy D and Ruth likes being at Hailsham, but when a new teacher named Miss Lucy arrives at the school and tells them that they are all clones, predetermined to become organ donors when they have reached adulthood, and that they will die after having given away all of their organs, it alters their prospects. Following this shocking revelation, Miss Lucy is released from her position as if nothing has happened and while life at Hailsham goes back to normal, Kathy and Tommy D grows closer to one another.

But, we are sucked in to caring about Kathy, Ruth and Tommy. This is the mark of the truly great movie. Carey again proves that she is the real thing, one of the finest actors of our age. She's too young to be this good. She acts with her face, her words, but mostly through her eyes, which look like they have the wisdom of the ages behind them. Of course, this cannot be, because she's only in her 20's. Add up her entire book of work, and she becomes one of the most bankable stars around.",2010

More confusion starts when we realize the kids are being lied to about their real destiny then a new teacher is hired who tells them the truth one day and is summarily fired the next for outing the school, but the kids don't cry or complain at all. I don't know about you but if I were told at age ten that I wasn't going to have no future and was just an organ donor who was destined to die young I think I might be a bit upset. Why this teacher from the outside was hired to begin with is also beyond me. And it seems easy enough for the kids to run away but no one even tries.",2010

7,"Robert Downey Jr was the best reason to watch the first Iron Man film since he seemed to slide into the role of Tony Stark so flawlessly and effortlessly. RDJ is just as amusing and fun to watch in Iron Man 2. If there were any doubts left over from RDJ's portrayal of Tony Stark from the first film, they're inevitably washed away with his convincing performance in the sequel. Newcomers Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson are just as impressive. Rourke has been on an incredible streak since The Wrestler and puts in another solid performance here. His Russian accent is pretty spot on and he shows a wider range of emotion than you may not be expecting. Rockwell has been on my ""actors to keep an eye on"" radar since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. I thoroughly enjoyed his smarmy performance as Hammer, who has all of the tools at his disposal to make as big of an impact on the world as Tony Stark has only to wind up falling short in the long run. The flirting between Tony and Johansson's Natalie Rushman is pretty captivating, but her crowning achievement is her fight scene in the latter half of the film that practically steals the show. Don Cheadle does have a few humorous one-liners and is great as War Machine, but doesn't really add anything that Terrence Howard already established with the role in the first film. It's slightly disappointing since Cheadle is known for his strong acting roles, but may be a result of the way the Capt. James Rhodes character was written for both films.",2010
8,"The sequel to Marvel studio's surprise hit of 2008 is here, bigger than ever. But is it better? After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high.",2010
6,Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts:,2010
7,"There's RDJ and his immeasurable charisma, there's Rockwell and Rourke rocking their lines, there's classy Paltrow and shallow ScarJo (bait for the horny nerds), there's good action.. and yet, something's missing. Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene.",2010
9,"I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played.",2010
7,"At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.",2010
1,"First, let me get this right; I am a FAN of the first Ironman movie;",2010
5,"First of all, if you expect to see lots of action in this movie - you will be disappointed! ",2010
7,"Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. ",2010
4,"In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark's ego swells to enormous levels. Written as some kind of Steve Jobs meets Richard Branson amalgam in a superhero costume, Robert Downey's wise-ass treatment of the character (still at tangents to what he represents in the original comics) seems self absorbed and cheeky. How could anyone find him likable as a hero? But beyond all of this is a simple fact, this sequel fails to do what every sequel must i.e. expand on the original and take the premise into uncharted territory.",2010
1,.SPOILERS WITHIN. ----------------- ,2010
1,Repeat: There's a turd in the punch bowl! ,2010
8,"Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.",2010
9,"The second installment of this Marvel series does not disappoint. Downey Jr. is once again a hit with a stunning performance as the narcissistic Tony Stark. This time around Tony is dealing with a health problem; the same miniature Arc-reactor that is keeping him alive, is also killing him. The metal needed to run the device is poisoning him. Stark starts down a destructive path until helped out by Sam Fury, who surfaced in the after-the-credits spoiler of the first movie, and the drop-dead gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Don Cheadle enters as the replacement for Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes. Mikey Rourke continues his action-movie prowess as the villain and Rhodes and Stark team up as Iron man and War Machine to bring him down. An action-packed thriller, Iron Man 2 keeps all on the edge of their seats.",2010
7,The new Iron Man sequel has attracted quite a bit of hype. Most of us were surprised back in 2008 that the first film had turned out not only bearable but pretty solid. The first film had walked the line between serious origin story and self-spoofing comic book comedy. The new film does the same and walks the delicate line between tension and comedic relief just as well as its predecessor.,2010
7,"At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.",2010
10,"I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.",2010
10,"When I first heard that Iron Man was being made into a movie, I didn't care much, but I still wanted to see it because of the action. I also chose to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was playing the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark. I've been a fan of Rob since Chaplin, that was truly a masterpiece, he can work the English accent perfectly. I always thought he was English because the first movie I saw with him was Natural Born Killers, but he was obviously Australian in that.",2010
5,"The hype for Iron Man 2 to be great was pretty big, by me anyway. But i was let down considerably. Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time. Also, Starks witty personality died out pretty quickly, so we are left annoyed and pleading him to stop by the credits.",2010
10,Before Iron Man was made John Favreau said he can never imagine anyone except Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and as we know RDJ's career went to a totally different level after that movie... Iron Man 2 promises the same.. ,2010
9,"Lately the genre of teen comedies skew to the ribald and the are more sex romps than tell stories and introduce characters that you can not only root for but like. ""Easy A"" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risqué, but heartfelt.",2010
9,"I attended a free preview of this movie and without having done any research on the movie and just based on a short synopsis, had pretty low expectations walking into the cinema. It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me, it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!) - it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!",2010
9,"Emma Stone stars as Olive, a lonely heart who lies about losing her virginity to her best friend and soon rumour spreads she is a slut. Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut, wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.",2010
7,"It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive (Emma Stone). Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone, and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway, Olive, without thinking things through, starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast, which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school, one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously, the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here, Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain, as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid, but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.",2010
8,"Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.",2010
8,"Through much of the beginning of ""Easy A,"" you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone, confesses she wants her life to have a ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Say Anything"" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and surprisingly touching comedy, any time ""Easy A"" wanders down the path of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it. ",2010
10,"According to Emma Stone's Olive, ""A is for Awesome."" ""Easy A"" is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" in this Twitter Age is whimsical, genuine, and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists, and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. ""Easy A"" is reminiscent of ""Juno"" in its clever and biting dialog. Where in ""Juno"" no one in real life actually speaks with those razor-like smarts, ""Easy A"" is witty and sharp in natural speak.",2010
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.",2010
7,"In California, the virgin student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) feels anonymous in the high school where she studies. When her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) invites her to spend the weekend with her family, Olive lies and tells that she will have a date with a nonexistent community college student. On the next Monday, Rhiannon goes to the bathroom with Olive and asks how her encounter was and Olive lies, telling that she lost her virginity in the weekend with her fictitious boyfriend. However, one school mate overhears their conversation and spreads the rumor about Olive's promiscuity. The religious fanatic Marianne (Amanda Bynes) blames her and out of the blue. Olive becomes a notorious student. ",2011
10,"... makes for a once in a lifetime film. Forget all that stuff about bringing the Scarlet Letter into modern times. It's noise. Pay attention to the fact that, despite the major success of this film, Emma Stone (who was technically in her 20s when this was filmed and therefore ""playing younger"") has no aspirations to become a teen idol nor get her own Disney show. What makes this film special -- aside from a script to die for and a superb portrayal by Stone, showing no strain whatsoever under the burden of dual duty, that is, both acting and doing a first person narrative, like Bogey in a filme noire -- is the simple fact that Stone will not be reprising this role (or anything similar) in either her lifetime or yours. And that is special. That's makes this film not only a one-of but also one of the best ""smart comedies"" ever, irregardless of age or audience.",2014
10,"I have seen this movie countless times and can say that it easily goes into the category of my favorite movies of all time. I am a huge fan of John Hughes and his classic 80's teen comedies, to me this just felt like another one of these with a modern twist and a storyline that more can relate to these days. It had a great cast, director and extremely well written script. The story follows Olive who tells a lie about something very personal and it spreads like wildfire through the school. She loses her friends and decides she no longer cares what people think about her. The movie told through a web-cam point of view and is accompanied by a soundtrack full of classic songs, many of which were featured in John Hughes' movies.",2013
5,"Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks, and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had, and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good (a re-working of The Scarlett Letter, which the film unashamedly references and possibly over-references).",2010
6,"Noble effort to make a movie with a questionably helpful message. I did enjoy the movie somewhat, but a few nagging things kept distracting me from really liking the movie. I will attempt to elaborate: ",2010
1,Olive decides that she's tired of being a 'Virgin' and makes up lies that she has lost her virginity to a boy...But then she makes the mistake of saying that she has slept with a fellow friend to help him from being bullied in school...and soon it seems that all the boys in school want her to do the same.,2011
4,"I first saw this movie a couple of weeks ago at a friends house. I didn't think it looked good enough to wait ten dollars on at the movie theater, and so glad I didn't. where to start?... it was awful! First of all this would never happen in high school, teachers and faculty would never allow it. I know Olive was trying to dress like a slut but maybe she could have found some cuter slutty clothes. Word does travel fast around school about rumors. But people really don't care that much about someone's sex life. The movie was way too exaggerated on the scenes with the rumors. One thing i did like was the little surprise that Mrs. Griffith was sleeping with the student Micah.",2011
4,"Yeah it was pretty bad and hopelessly overrated too, I just watched it then came online immediately to comment. Nobody is gonna look back on this clichéd, heavily stereotyped, unfunny farce 10 years from now and say oh! wow! It's now a classic like the greater movies of the same genre from the 70s and 80s. Too much of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. That high school was more like a resort than a school and none of the kids looked like teenagers, they all looked like super-duper seniors. I respect Aly Mischalka for taking such a blink and you'll miss her role, I would be embarrassed too if I had been presented with such a lame script about nothing that addresses and resolves nothing. Pretty girl can't get dates so she pretends to be a floozy to get the attention of all the guys in her school...ugh! Okay. With so many jokes about other epic literary works, better films and stellar acting you would think that Easy A was about to take it to the next level but unfortunately it all falls flat about halfway through and follows the cliché of other similar movies rather than be the different film everybody expected it would be. Nothing new here people, same script, different cast.",2011
9,"EASY A – CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!",2010
3,I am honestly surprised to see the good reviews that this movie has been getting. I found it to completely lack direction or logic. The characters were hardly likable or even realistic; and I think the message it sends is not a particularly good one to send to the clearly intended younger audience. Not a fan.,2010
2,Easy A has received so many positive reviews I was astonished at how bad it was. From the beginning it was difficult to suspend disbelief that a 17-year-old girl would stand out from the crowd for losing her virginity. And how much more difficult to suspend disbelief when the actress playing the character is 22.,2010
2,"John Hughes would roll over in his grave if he saw this poor excuse for a high-school movie (especially since it contains several references to his blockbuster films). The plot is not believable at all, the script is encumbered with dialog that often makes the actors sound scripted, and the acting is extremely sub par overall.",2010
3,"""Easy A"" starts off OK for about 10-15 min of the runtime but degenerates into trashy reprehensible mockery. Watching a bunch of 20-somethings parade around a fictitious high school as utterly unconvincing high school students with ADD, false-religion, and zeal fails at being a farce. The rip-offs from older and better done ""teen"" and John Hughes movies litters this movie and signals it's bereavement of ideas. Particularly awful are decent full-aged and experienced adult actors as parents reduced to mocking child-buddies especially Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. For example in several scenes, you have Clarkson giving inappropriate WAY over-the-top sex talks with her high school daughter, lead Emma Stone. This movie is a sad example of supposed aimed parody that utterly fails. Stay away or if you have to pick it up at the library.",2010
3,"The more I thought about ""Easy A"", the less I liked it. This is a shame, because while there's plenty to like about it, there's just as much to dislike. The movie is inspired by ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which I'll admit, I never got around to studying in my A.P. English class. But I know the book is about adultery, which the movie has very little to do with. True, there is some adultery in the movie. But whenever the term is thrown around in the movie, it doesn't mean what the filmmakers seem to think it means. ""Adultery"", for the record, is when a married person sleeps with someone other than his or her spouse. Olive Penderghast, as played by Emma Stone, never sleeps with a married person. In fact, she never sleeps with anyone at all.",2010
10,"I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.",2010
10,"I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. ",2010
8,"Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.",2010

One day, the queen who ruled that land couldn't give birth, so she needed a special flower in order to have a baby. The king ordered his servants to trace the location of the flower, and gave it to his wife. In short, the baby was successfully born, but Gothel got angry and decided to take revenge, so she kidnapped the baby, aiming for her magic hair which she could use for eternal life. Rapunzel, the baby, grew up with her fake mother's (Gothel) lies, telling her that outside the tower was full of dangerous things. There was a handsome thief who managed to steal the Princess' tiara. He hid in Rapunzel's tower and then they met for the very first time. Mother Gothel tried to separate them but she failed. And the two of them finally saw the floating lantern, which was her biggest dream ever.",2012

10,"Not often does a movie bring tears in my eye, and this one truly turned on the waterworks. Maybe because I am going through my own hard times, or because I had just read a throughly heartbreaking the night before, but regardless, Tangled currently stands as one of the greatest animated films I have ever seen. ",2010
9,"I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.",2010

10,While updating our own profile on Facebook we came across a great link posted by Apollo Cinema Burnley for some free preview tickets for the new film Tangled 3D a film based on the story of Rapunzel which has been sprinkled with a little Disney Magic.,2011
10,"This movie hits the mark on all levels. It is beautifully illustrated and the story is simple, yet works and keeps your interest. I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!",2011
10,"I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway.",2011
9,"I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.",2011

From past few years Disney was was struggling,but i think they have recovered by making this Oscar deserving animation.It's a family entertainment with a very strong story line and the execution was just perfect.Hat's off to the director and the writer and i expect more from Disney now that they will make such masterpieces again.This is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen.Tangled had everything, and much more. The only way to truly experience this spectacular viewing is to see it for yourself! It spoke volumes to me, and on so many different levels! Rating 10/10 :D .A must watch :)",2012

10,"We took our two kids (4 and 6)to see a preview of this days before the official release. In short, it was one of the best Disney films yet. Everyone simply loved it. The 3-D effects were noticeable and wonderful. We got a kick watching our 4-year-old raise his hands as if to catch some of the action float off the screen. There were tears, and much laughter, as is Disney's style. The story of Rapunzel is very well told here, with great villains, heroes and wonderfully entertaining scene-stealers, like the non-verbal horse, Maximus. The music is very theatrical and very typical of the usual Alan Menken genius (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc.). This movie is very entertaining for adults, and the kids will absolutely go crazy for it! Treat your family this season to a great movie! You won't be disappointed.",2010

Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!",2012
10,"In the course of the last decade Disney had suffered a severe decline in quality. They lost that heart, magic and soul that once made them the rulers of animation. Move to 2008 and Bolt brought a ray of hope. Then in 2009 The princess and the frog marked their return to fairy tales. Enter 2010 with Tangled a fantastic movie that has all the elements to be a classic and a great movie for years to come. The story is very simple yet the movie never loses it pace. The animation is gorgeous and the music may not be epic but is everything you can expect from Alan Menken. In overall a great movie worthy of all the attention it can get. Lets hope that Disney continues this way.",2011
10,"I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a HUGE line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. When I say that, I don't mean like Cinderella or Snow White, waiting for her prince to come and get her. I mean like Ariel, Belle, or Jasmine. She's curious about the world, headstrong, passionate, beautiful, and, of course, sweet and kind. Oh, and she's a girl that knows what she wants--to see a spectacular light show in person. But Rapunzel is stuck up in her tower with her mother, Gothel. Now, as the movie shows us, Rapunzel doesn't mind the tower all that much. She really loves Gothel, and she's kind of scared of the world outside. All she wants to do is see thousands of lanterns lit and launched into the sky, which she watches from her window every year on her birthday. This seems like a pretty reasonable request to me. But Gothel doesn't want her daughter to leave the tower for her own selfish, vain reasons (that you have to watch the movie to find out about). So poor, lonely Rapunzel seems doomed to spend the rest of her life trapped in a tower, watching and waiting for someone to come along and save her. And someone does come along! The swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider, steals a crown and runs for cover before the palace guards can arrest him. He just happens to end up in the secluded spot of the forest that Rapunzel's tower is in. He gets one glance of her hair, then is knocked out with a frying pan and shoved in a closet. After coming to, Rapunzel bargains with her prisoner. She'll give him back the crown if he guides her to the lanterns, then takes her home. Flynn agrees. The music in this film isn't quite up to par with Disney's best (Circle of Life, Part of Your World, etc.), but since it was written by Alan Menken, it's definitely good enough to get into your head--and stay there. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"", sung by Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, is my personal favorite. The pop/country style is modern but fits the story, and the tune is catchy. The other songs are ""Mother Knows Best"", ""I've Got a Dream"", and ""I See the Light"". While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider are great characters, I have to say that a certain Maximus the horse stole the show for me. The speechless character's facial expressions and quirky mannerisms are hilarious. He seems to hate Flynn, but he later proves how lovable and loyal he really is. Pasqual the chameleon also provides some comic relief, but the one to look for is a short, drunk old man wearing only a diaper and wings. He has very limited screen time, but he always says something hilarious. I saw this film in 3D, which, although beautiful, probably wasn't a very different experience than it was in 2D, except for one scene towards the end, when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by thousands of glowing lanterns. It was breathtaking. I rate Tangled a 9.5/10. It's creative, visually astounding, and possesses that Walt Disney magic that is so hard to find lately. But don't just take my word for it. Spend the money—you won't regret it. ",2010
10,"I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.",2011
10,"First let me say that I am not usually the one who give reviews to movies, but this one I felt was necessary. When I went to see Disney's Tangled, I really wasn't expecting much. The previews I saw hadn't appealed to me enough, but a group of friends went to see it and I was dragged there. To put it in simple terms, it was amazing! Not only were the characters believable, but the relationships between them were as well, especially between the hero, heroine and villain. The design was very detailed and beautiful; I personally loved the scene with the lights -if you've seen it, you know what I mean. As for the score, I feel it went back to the classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""; the songs were very much like the movies when I was growing up, when Disney was the number one choice for kids. Although in my opinion, Tangled didn't manage to bring a song as memorable as key songs like ""Part of your world"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", I can't take the ""Healing Song"" out of my mind.",2010
10,"Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.",2010
10,"I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss.",2011
10,When I first started watching this show I thought it was going to be just another cop drama like the other 500 on TV but no somewhere amidst pile of scripts that is good drama they found one that shines above the rest. ,2010
9,"The previews that TNT used initially weren't overly interesting and some of the critics gave this new show mediocre ratings. That being said, I'm glad I chose to ignore the critics (as usual) and give this new cop drama a shot. Glad I did. It rolls right along with well written story lines and nice touches of humor here and there to lighten up what could be a very dark premise. I can't rave enough about the casting of Angie Harmon as the tough-talking but occasionally insecure police detective Jane Rizzoli, who's driving ambition and outer roughness bely a compassionate individual who's trying to do the right thing, no matter what. Sasha Alexander is a wonderful breath of fresh air as Maura Isles, the science and medicine half of this dynamic duo. She plays Isles with just the right amount of nerdy quirkiness to make the character endearing and brilliant, without crossing over into annoying know-it-all territory. What makes this work is the great chemistry between the two female leads, who come across as believable in their roles without sacrificing appearances too much. You could actually picture Harmon as a cop because she conveys it so well. The supporting cast is wonderful as well and it's awesome to see the uber talented Donnie Wahlberg back in front of cameras where he belongs. No offense to his New Kids On The Block gig but, the man is a decent actor and should definitely keep working that particular side of his talent. This is a great new show and so far, the stories move with a quick, satisfying clip to them so boredom is not an issue. TNT usually blows away most of the big networks with their choice of programming and ""Rizzoli and Isles"" is no exception to that rule. Give it a look-see for a couple of episodes; it's worth it.",2010
7,"TNT has done it again they have once again produced another hit series as they have good luck with crime dramas. This one set in Boston ""Rizzoli and Isles"" involves the cases of crime and murder in Boston and you have daylight and dark working together on the cases. First enter the tough and by the book seasoned detective Jane Rizzoli(played wonderful by the sexy and exotic beauty Angie Harmon)as Jane always questions the clues and evidence found at the scene, and to make matters more interesting is the educated and witty crime scene medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles(Sasha Alexander)who looks inside the dead bodies for more answers. And both differ on opinions and ways of solving cases still the work ethic and chemistry blends well to form a good crime fighting solving team. Typically the cases they crack are gruesome and cold blooded murders the kind of cases you've seen on TV involving lust killers and serial murders. Usually always in the end the hard work leads to twist and turns with the bad guy being caught.",2010
10,After watching the first episode of Rizzoli & Isles I was more than satisfied .. I've wanted to see Sasha Alexander and Angie Harmon back on my t.v screen ever since Sasha left N.C.I.S and Women's Murder Club got canceled. Sasha is supposed to act the way she acts in the t.v show it is in no way bad acting she's supposed to be a bid like Brennan from Bones who's a bit detached from her emotions to say the least. People are comparing Rizzoli & Isles to Bones and it's because they have a lot in common though Rizzoli & Isles had a much better first episode than Bones did and just because this show isn't one of HBO's productions and doesn't have people fornicating on every corner doesn't make it bad. It's just something you can watch with your kids or maybe even brother or sister without feeling awkward because of what's happening on the screen and actually enjoying a show. I definitely recommend this.,2010
10,"Being a fan of NCIS I was disappointed at the departure of Sasha Alexander and I hoped that she would appear in another television series doing something she really enjoys. But I was never a fan of Angie Harmon and she was my least favorite Assistant D.A. on Law and Order. It was hard for me to imagine Angie Harmon playing a tough, tomboyish Boston detective. Actually, I was thinking before the show aired that the roles should have been reversed. I could buy Sasha Alexander being the tough cop more than I could Angie Harmon.",2010
10,"As a female lawyer who truly loves the law and everything that has to do with crime and punishment and as a self-proclaimed connoisseur of crime TV, I must write my first review and express how overjoyed I am with this show! I'm already anxious to buy the show on DVD, and I've only seen one episode. If the rest of this season is anything compared to the first episode I know that I can look forward to many more seasons. Rizzoli (Harmon) is believable as the tough girl who honors the law (yet is able to maintain her incredible sexiness at the same time.) And Isles (Sasha) is the fashionista who crazily enough loves her often disgusting job as the medical examiner. (She also brings a lot of the subtle humor with her character's attitude.) I identified with both main characters, found there was enough excitement to keep my attention throughout the entire episode(and enough humor...but not too much) and was left with heightened anticipation until next week.",2010
10,"When I first heard of the new show with both Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander, 1) I was thrilled to see Sasha back on TV and 2) I was worried that Angie Harmon's new character would be like Lindsay Boxer (Women's Murder Club) which bored the crap out of me.",2010
10,"I have never been a big fan of ""cop shows,"" however when I saw the promos for this show I decided I had to at least give it a chance. As a lady, I like to see women being strong and respected, and Rizzoli and Isles provides two women who are respected in their fields. Rizzoli (Harmon) is impressive and spot-on with her tough girl,take nothing' from no one, attitude. Isles (Alexander) is genius and sincere. The duo provides both a kick-butt team two best friends trying to live their lives. The characters are totally relatable, which is perhaps how I got pulled into being a fan. Harmon and Alexander make an amazing team and the chemistry and timing is there. I just couldn't see this show working with any other female leads. The supporting cast is excellent as well. I'm telling you, tune in. If you, like me, usually pass on these types of shows,give this one a chance. It just might surprise you. I'm pretty stoked about next season.",2010
10,"Anybody out there old enough to remember them? I haven't seen another cop show with two women since then that I can recall. Maybe all you youngsters out there don't remember a time when having a lead role was a big deal for women. But since Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly, have there been any other strong female leads paired up together? Lots of male/female pairings,sure, but two women? I can't think of any off the top of my head, and believe me, I watch a lot of TV. I like the idea that both of these characters are women who work hard, are competent at what they do, have a sense of humor, love their families, and have a strong sense of ethics. I also like that the series is based on a book series written by a woman. Women's voices and faces need to be heard and seen in Hollywood in all kinds of roles. Don't forget that in the 70's women were still fighting for the right to be treated equally, and that Cagney and Lacey served as role models. Hopefully Rizzoli and Isles can do the same.",2010
8,I do hope that the series based on author Tess Gerritsen's characters of Boston Homicide detective Jane Rizzoli and medical examiner Maura Isles keeps going. I think that's a sure bet if the quality of episodes keeps up from what I've seen. ,2010
1,This show is only suitable for people who haven't read the books and are waiting for the fall season for real TV. Harmon is too tall and too attractive to be Rizzoli and she runs around the set like a maniac. Alexander is nothing like Isles who has black hair and is cool and cerebral. I've read 5 of the books and never once did she diagnose a date's malady or giggle at something inappropriate or shop for shoes. The idea that they end every day swilling beer is absurd. I hate when TV takes great characters and turns them into pablum. All of this might be forgivable except that the writing was awful and the plot was unbelievable. Bringing back the Boston Strangler in episode #2? All that tells me is these writers have nothing else going for them.,2010
1,"When Sasha Alexander's character was written out of ""NCIS"" I was very disappointed. Ms. Alexander brought a warmth, intelligence and camaraderie to the show that would prove hard to replace. So, when I heard that she had landed a lead role in ""Rizzoli and Isles"" I was looking forward to it.",2010
1,"Well, I saw the third episode of this, and I'm shocked I got through the whole thing.",2010
1,"I love the novels by Tess Gerritsen based on these two characters so I was so excited to see it coming to TV. I must say that I don't watch much TV and have never seen either Angie Harmon or Sasha Alexander before as I've never watched Law & Order or NCIS. I think Angie Harmon is just terrible. I thought the first episode was bad enough until I tried to watch last night's episode. I finally turned it off because it was so bad. I also hate it when they cast characters who don't even come close to matching the description of the character in the book. Maura Isles has black hair and is a very somber and serious kind of character. Last night it seemed like she was on the verge of laughter at each of the crime scenes and during the autopsy. And, what's with the tortoise? I hated to give this even one star. It's just awful. When I watch TV, it's usually HGTV. I think I'll stick with that!",2010
1,"The show's marketing looked exceptional, and I was excited to watch an episode. Turns out I couldn't even make it through one, and I tried three different times.",2011
3,"Cable channels have developed some great shows in recent years and I hoped this would be a worthy addition and perhaps I should give it more time but from the start the show lacks chemistry and freshness. I have like Bruce McGill from his first appearance on Miami Vice, and Sasha Alexander was great on NCIS but McGill is badly used and Alexander is no Ducky. The show just feels like it has not only been done before but done better which it has. The cast is lackluster and the writing dull. If they were hoping to channel Cagney and Lacy they missed by a wide mark, This isn't an update just a shadow imitation, Perhaps the writing will get better, perhaps I will care about the characters but I don't give the show as is much hope. Right now it's fortunate to follow The Closer but to be honest I am skipping that to watch The Good Guys and cycling back to catch The Closer at 11.",2010
7,"The two leads are much better than the writing they are given. They are really wasted in this what appears to be low low low budget attempt to do faux Dashiel Hammet. The writing is only bare bones, with the fewest dialog lines possible, and lots of meaningful camera angles, so you actually have to watch sometimes, and the characterization and continuity is very simplistic. The plots are pure cheese, and sometimes look like they are from social issues of more than 30 years ago rather than today, but there is an occasional real belly laugh. This isn't the Maltese Falcon.... but its entertaining enough, so if its late at night and you need something to put you to sleep give it a try.",2011
9,"I've had a crush on Angie Harmon ever since I first saw her in 'Good Advice'. Not my usual type (in the words of George Burns: too tall); but she has amazing eyes and I could listen to her talk all day. Teamed up with Sasha Alexander, the best thing from NCIS, they make a great pair.",2011
10,"This show is absolutely amazing. I'm glad I discovered it one day when I was randomly flipping through the channels. I've always enjoyed watching cop shows, or forensic shows in general. I'm a complete sucker for CSI Las Vegas, Law and Order SUV, Castle and Bones. Now Rizzoli and Isles is up there as well.",2011
1,"This was horrible. There was no emotion or feeling from these actors(?). Harmon showed more feelings in L & O, especially in the episode where she admits her rape in college to McCoy. And Alexander had even less, she was more passionate as a dead Caitlyn in NCIS. The killer was not believable as a deranged killer. And Harmon's escape was so unbelievable. Someone needs to review these scripts better before airing them. The FBI agent could tale lessons from Tony of NCIS. The Rizzoli family was not very emotional in support of their family member or seemed very concerned at all in the plot. The best part of the whole episode was Joe Friday!",2010
2,"While there are rare moments that are good, so much of the 'acting' is just terrible. I really wanted to like this... but could not.",2013
5,"I should state up front that I would happily watch Angie Harmon doing housework all day. That is probably the only reason I got to the end of the first episode and lined up for the second. I am glad I did as it is a much better effort. It is hard to find fault with any show with a cast as strong as this. With guest spots from Brian Dennehy, Chaz Palminteri and Donny Wahlberg, along with the strong regular cast that includes Lorraine Bracco, it is easy to overlook some of the show's shortcomings.",2010
10,"If you were a fan of Women's Murder Club, and missed it when it was canceled after 13 episodes, you will like this show. Angie Harmon plays a similar character, looks the same, talks and walks in the exact similar way. In this series, the Assistant D.A. and journalist have been ditched.",2010
10,"This show captures all ends of the spectrum! It's rare that a show pulls you into its characters like this one does. After just one episode you will find yourself drawn to Jane and Maura, and you'll want to actually be friends with them.

However, the show is nothing like the books at all, I know it's based on the books and not actually about the books but what happened to Mauras killer mother and dead twin sister? And Janes parents splitting up? And the priest? I think the show alone could be alright by itself, but i wish they would stop comparing the books, it's 2 different stories, the characters are no where near the same, In fact Jane & Maura barely know much about each other, They just work together on a lot of cases, It's mentioned in the books several times, they don't hang out outside of work very often at all, yet in the show they are best friends?",2011
8,"Upon first viewing the trailer I was immediately giddy to see a new post-apocalyptic film in the vein of The Road Warrior.

So, when movies come out this time of the year there is a distinct possibility that the movie is going to have a weak story line and sub par acting. This is not the case with ""The Book of Eli."" For a January movie — it exceeded my expectations.",2010
7,"Everybody's talking about what happens after the apocalypse these days.  ""The Book of Eli"" is sort of the boiling point of this science-fiction  concept, a combination of last year's ""The Road"" and George Miller's  ""The Road Warrior."" America is a post-apocalyptic wasteland and Denzel  Washington is the only self-sufficient badass. So originality is not  exactly ""Eli's"" calling card, but it clearly establishes its ruinous  world and the Hughes brothers (""From Hell"") take good care of its  characters while supplying top-notch action.  Washington stars as our stolid protagonist, Eli, journeying westward  with his canteen, a large machete, a couple guns and a special  leather-bound book. He lives on an Earth that was fried 30 years before  by the sun because of a war that ripped a hole through the ozone layer.  Sun-goggled bikers run amok pillaging, killing and raping passers-by,  yet Eli is morally sound and focused on keeping his book safe no matter  what so he can deliver it somewhere out west.  Although written by a first-time screenwriter and former PC Gamer  editor, Gary Whitta, ""Eli"" impressively creates its world between the  sunglasses/goggles due to the sun's power, trading of goods because  money's obsolete and the constant examining of hands to determine if  someone is jittery from eating too much human flesh. Whitta also places  Eli squarely in the story. He's a good but dangerous man who's not  afraid to kill, and as he sits idly by as a couple gets attacked, it's  abundantly clear that this is a world where compassion is secondary to  survival and self-interest.  Where the plot comes in is ""Eli's"" weak link. It doesn't try too hard  to hide just what exactly the book is and that sort of dissolves some  of the film's mystique. The plot is essentially Eli wants to protect it  and take it west and he has a run in with Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an  older man who runs a small town and desires it for selfish  power-related reasons. Along the way, anyone who threatens to lay a  hand on Eli gets sliced up or shot. In the two or three fight scenes  where he takes down numerous guys at once, you can't help but wonder  why after he kills the first few guys, the others don't run the hell  away, especially considering people are otherwise in self-preservation  mode living in a wasteland (and they know nothing of the book).  The Hughes brothers make those scenes worthwhile, however. There's a  style and grace to their action scenes -- they create a sort of a  moving tableau in some scenes and execute a wide range of tempos in the  action sequences to make them more intense. When Carnegie's men  encounter Eli and the young woman (Mila Kunis) that he inspires who  follows him at the home of some old folks (cameos by famous Brits  Frances De La Tour and Michael Gambon), they place the camera in the  middle of the action and sweep along with the gunfire (part- digitally)  from one side to the other. It's very cool and is an example of one way  the Hugheses keep the focus away from the plot's shaky skeleton. I only  have beef with their excessive slow-motion walking-toward-the-camera  shots and showing a bit too much of the cloudy green-gray sky.  Some people are going to be more surprised and impressed with the  film's big reveal than others, but anyone with a love of action and  that post-apocalyptic context will find something to make ""Eli"" a  worthwhile watch regardless of plot weakness. Washington is slightly  under-utilized but he's an ideal fit. He brings an intensity in his  demeanor that makes him an intriguing character and the film does a  good job of making his character more central than anything else.  ~Steven C",2010
1,"Not sure how much the church was involved with this project, but it seems as though it was funded almost entirely by the church. And maybe Oprah. If not, the church should provide the people who made this movie with free blessings for a year - or whatever.",2010
2,"I have to agree with one reviewer that stated the movie should have ended with the shot of Eli's eyes. Solara becoming the next warrior is ridiculous. The actors were fine but why doesn't Denzel Washington realize that most of the movie doesn't make sense. He uses his bow in the first scene and takes the arrow. After that we don't see where he carries his bow until he needs it later in the film. He has his backpack emptied a couple of times and no shells for his guns or bow is seen. After killing the 2 guys he didn't take his arrows. Eli then tells Solara to take down the bow and wind up the bowstring and he is carrying 1 arrow. In the next scene the bow and arrow are absent. In the opening scene the sky is ominous and an eerie green with particles falling from the sky. At the end of the movie Alcatraz has blue skies, clouds and grass. Am I expected to think it took Eli 30 years to walk across the US? Were those plastic wrapped twinkies that he was sharing with Solara? How would they have tasted 30 years later? Would someone explain how he got out of the locked room (I missed that part)? The house where they were in the shootout with Carnegie and his henchmen was completely full of bullet holes except where the old couple and Eli/Solara were standing. When Solara causes the vehicle she's in to crash how does Eli's blade (which was on the dashboard) get embedded completely to the hilt in Redridge's chest? Is the woman hijacker (with the grocery cart) the same as the second one nearer to the end of the movie? If so how does she get a new gang (since Eli has killed all of her first friends) and get further down the road towards Alcatraz for Solara and Eli to meet again? To have the same ambush using a woman crying with a grocery cart seems lazy to me. Now after dictating the entire bible (with a big hole in his gut/chest) the bible is printed, leather bound and gold leafed only to be placed on a shelf where no one is going to read it. I'm glad for those who enjoyed the movie. It just has too many questionable and unbelievable scenes which caused my frustration. And I wish people would stop comparing this sham of a movie to 'The Road'.",2010

1,I'd like to make a short list of things that annoyed the living hell out of me in the film.,2013
1,"Well, I went to see this film last night not knowing much about the actual plot of it. The start was promising, with some great fight scenes and on the whole, it was well filmed with some great cinematography. Washington played his role well, as did Oldman as Carnegie, however Mila Kunis who anyone who watches 'Family Guy' could tell was the voice of Meg Griffin wasn't good at all. The fact she is the voice of Meg also made me unable to take her seriously, but thats probably just me. I enjoyed the film at the start up until it becomes apparent that 'the book' is in fact the Bible. The fact that the whole film was based around this alienated a lot of people who may be atheist or even if they were Christian, as it was completely hypocritical that Eli killed maybe 100s of people in order to keep the book. Is this in-keeping with Christianity? Well, now the ending. It just about had it for me when we found out that Eli was blind. This put the great fighting scenes that i mentioned earlier in a poorer light for me, as we realised he was supposed to be fighting several people single handedly whilst blind?? Completely ridiculous. as was the fact that he was shot in the stomach, and then 5 minutes later back on the road with some duck tape over the wound. On the whole, its maybe worth seeing if you don't mind contradictory and frankly ridiculous plot twists, hearing Meg Griffin's voice throughout a supposedly tense and serious film and of course, if you don't mind killing 100s of people for the possession of a Bible written in braille.",2010
9,"You might be jaded already with a number of big budgeted science fiction films that are set after some apocalyptic disaster that wiped out most of humankind, and having the protagonist become some sole, lonely survivor up against others who have banded together for worse, and without law and order and faced with severely limited resources to survive, cannibalism in a wild wild west environment becomes the order of the day, with those having weapons commanding over those who don't, and a clean bed, warm food, women and clean water are precious, tradable commodities.",2010

1,"It started off with such promise, the fight scenes were excellent .... But then the horrible truth dawned on us that the book was the Bible , bearing in mind that the war which destroyed the world was a religious one ! After this point the Movie began to get more and more far fetched and funny ""30 years to get to the Midwest ?"" then when we realised he was blind ! we couldn't help but laugh :) this how ever explained some things like backing into the shadows to even the fight (not sure how he knew there were shadows there though.) Killing a Cat with a bow and arrow while lying down and erm BLIND ! Shot in the stomach with a 9mm hand gun,then back pack on and off down the road we go?! The end creased us up too, after dictating the entire bible, they reprinted and bound it and placed it in between the Quran and the Torah ! I think the irony was lost on them.",2010
1,"This 'movie' left me feeling slightly used - by Denzel Washington. It's a bit like battlefield earth, but with God instead of thetans, and Gary Oldman instead of John Travolta (the parallel is fairly loose really, but i think it stands). I'm really not happy being preached to by movies, especially those whose central character fails to live up to anything he tells other people (how Christian is it to cut another mans hand off?). If you're a Christian, don't go to see this movie - it's violent (this violence is seemingly OK, as long as it's a good guy killing people in the name of God, rather than the bad guys killing people - which I find to be a rather worrying message). If you're not a Christian, don't go and see this movie, unless you like being preached to. Go and watch The Road. It's much better.",2010
1,"This movie explains that the Earth was destroyed because of wars of religion and that therefore the survivors destroyed every religious books to prevent from repeating the same disaster. And yet, one man – Eli played by Denzel Washington – who's supposed to be a good man, a wise man chooses to preserve one of these religious books which was partly responsible for almost destroying the Earth!! What's the idea? He expects this time the job will be done correctly and Earth and mankind will be destroyed completely? The Hughes brothers are trying to say that religions are a good thing that can be bad if used by the wrong people (Gary Oldman's character). Which is a stupid message. The good question is: do we need religion to live together? The answer is no because as soon as someone has one religion he rejects anyone having another religion (or no religion at all). Religious tolerance is a myth, it does not exist. Man has invented something better than religions to live together, it's called Laic Democracy. One more thing, Eli hears voices (like Joan of Arc) telling him what to do and the Hughes brothers, who obviously believe in God, implicitly assert that God exists by this subterfuge (since ""He speaks to Eli""). Didn't the Hughes brothers ever heard of medical science? Someone who hears voices from God (or anyone else) is not a Saint it's someone who suffers from schizophrenia (a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder). By the way, religions do exist, it's a fact. And God does not exist, it's a fact.",2010
2,"I've always liked The Hughes Brothers. From Menace II Society to Dead Presidents to American Pimp to From Hell, they are amazing filmmakers. That said, The Book Of Eli separates itself from their other films. This is not to say this is a good thing. See, The Book Of Eli lacks what The Hughes Brothers usually have. Examples of what those are-characters, a story, a plot, good acting, good direction, entertainment value, ETC. Look, I could go on and on of how bad of a film The Book Of Eli is. From its boring, stupid, absurd set up to its final, terrible, rip off final twist, The Hughes Brothers, as much as their other films have amazed me, have made an undeniably bad film. Denzel Washington is supposed to be a bad ass at the end of the world, and Gary Oldman is supposed to be the evil gang member who wants Washington's magical book. Mila Kunis is the daughter of Oldman who follows Washington. However, the actors are so painfully dull that none of them can pull of their roles, and the roles, along with the movie becomes stupid and boring. As for the twist, even if the movie was amazing, the last 5 minute twist would have made me hate the movie anyway. Avoid this movie at all costs, and I mean all costs.",2010
1,"I am disappointed, Denzel ? This movie gets a minus 10 (what movie) Praise the lord, or Eli for that matter. Quite a shot with that bow and arrow for a blind guy. He probably thought that cat was a small deer. 30 years after what? The big boom? If there were so many humans alive what happen to the other bibles. Funny how the only one left would be in Braile, owned by a Blind guy that can shoot moving targets out of the air with a bow and arrow. And P.S. Where was the Nuclear Winter? Looking forward to a good horror flick, as obviously to me this didn't make any sense, although, I'm sure my local pasture would love this movie. Along with it's incredible miracles, I think my dog got more out of it than I did. This movie was so bad, it is hard to critique it more without becoming abusive, I would recommend it to someone who is really pressed for time, sitting there patiently in their pressed time trying to figure out what the hell this movie is about.",2010
1,"To be honest i thought i was going to enjoy this film. I was strongly wrong however. This is Washingtons worst role to date and a thorough let down on all sides technically. The Book of Eli was stupid as well as idiotic in that nothing made sense. The action, dialogue and casting was absolutely out of place and didn't serve any meaning or emotional response from me. It had this tone of being an MTV style movie that looked tacky and out place. And why did Gary Oldman want to take part in this gruelling and underly layered flop? I mean, he starred in The Dark Knight so surely seeing the quality of that compared to this he should have easily said no. But obviously not.",2010
1,"Unbelievably stupid scenes added together make for quite a time waster of a movie. I too would want the world to adapt so that I can always be in danger, but in what ever situation fate has in store for me somehow come out the winner! Had this been real, Eli would have died probably 10-15 times within those two hours, which would have actually made for a lot more entertainment than the actual movie.",2010
6,This is a film that starts with one of the most strikingly beautiful scenes I've seen in a long time . Credit to the Hughes Brothers for directing it and most especially a big thank you to cinematographer Don Burgess for shooting a scene that instantly draws you in to the movie . One does feel slight apprehension that the film can't sustain this opening and you're going to be watching a film that is style over substance . Guess what ? You're going to be watching a film that is not only style over substance but is quite illogical and even insulting in its storytelling ,2013
9,"This tale is one of a kind. I love the cinematography, acting, lighting, music, and sound. Watching the trailer i though it may be just another action film with no substance, boy was i wrong. Throughout the years Christianity has been skewed and manipulated to control the masses. This film demonstrates the good in spirituality in sharp contrast to the bad. Classic light against dark.",2010
7,"I saw this when it came out in the cinema and quite liked it. Now it has come round on TV I thought it might be worth a second viewing. This film is about the quest of one man to get a book to the place it's supposed to be, to use his words. Now, I'm not a religious man but I can see the value this book might have in a world torn apart by war. It is a post-apocalyptic world, thirty years after it was destroyed. Those that were not killed scratch a living out of what's left, and many have turned to cannibalism. Many were blinded by the flashes in the sky but survived. As stated in the film, after the war people destroyed the bible blaming it for what happened, but Eli has the last remaining copy. Now you know the set-up, here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters please don't touch Eli not if you want to keep your hands that is and wait here while I write the next paragraph).",2011
1,"The whole premise of this movie is simply too ludicrous for anyone with two brain cells to rub together to believe. The Bible has been translated into 2,479 languages and has been printed literally BILLIONS of times. The Gideons alone have placed 1.3 BILLION Bibles and New Testaments in hotels across the world. There is a Bible in virtually every hotel room in America. Yet somehow we are to believe that after a nuclear war, the few remaining survivors somehow successfully harnessed what little energy and resources they had left and channeled them into destroying BILLIONS of copies of the Bible. They did this rather than, you know, say, trying to survive in the aftermath of nuclear war. Preposterous!",2010
3,"Hmmm... Aside from the action, and the presence of two A-list actors, there was very little to recommend this childish gibberish. It's as if a committee of writers collaborated without seeing each other's work, and the director swore he'd make the film exactly as they wrote it, regardless of whether it makes any sense.",2010
9,"Director Derek Cianfrance may wish to stop wasting his talent on TV and make films his full time occupation. Cinema could use him. His 'Blue Valentine' studies the breakdown of a marriage through beautiful and heartbreaking juxtaposed scenes of past joy and optimism with present scenes of misery and depression. Flitting back and forth in the marriage, it asks: Is romantic love the ultimate form of masochism?",2011
10,"I am going to soap box it here for a second. The MPAA (those fine folk who decide what rating a film will receive) ticks me off to no end. Their system feels arbitrary, outdated, and stupid. You can only use the ""F"" word once in the non literal sense and maintain a PG-13 rating. Because that's the problem, kids hearing the ""f"" word too many times. For want of any other description, it is terribly stupid.",2010
9,"No matter what else is yet to be released, you will not see two better performances this year than Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.",2010
8,"I came away from this film more wary of love and relationships than any film I've ever seen. You look at Dean's character (Gosling's best role to-date) and wonder what it is that he did wrong. He fell for a beautiful, young woman (Williams), stepped-up to care for her and her yet-unborn daughter, and shifted his life to focus entirely on being a good husband and father. He was so charming in his interactions with his daughter, and was also loving towards his wife enduring more rejection from her than most could, trying to breathe love back into the relationship. Even his outbursts seemed attempts to give her what she wanted.",2011
8,"This family album is familiar. A beautiful small town girl meets an eccentric but charming stranger and they fall in dumb. Five years and one enchanting child later, his romantic notions sustain the illusion of his happiness, but her reality is not so poetic. This is a quick snapshot of Dean, Cindy, and Frankie. What happens in this family is what happens to so many others when affection is replaced by contempt, when passive aggression becomes less the former and more or less the latter.",2010
10,BLUE VALENTINE is both sweet and emotionally devastating. It's raw in every sense of the word. Writer/director Derek Cianfrance has crafted a brave and genuine relationship-character study. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams floor me. Acting doesn't get better than this,2010
10,"If ever there was a perfect film that defines the romantic relationship for the 21st century, Derek Cianfrance's 'Blue Valentine' is that film. We begin at a secluded ranch house where a little girl is trying to find her lost dog. We then see her father (Ryan Gosling) comforting her. Enter mom (Michelle Williams), the concerned mother who tries to balance work and her child's needs. Seems like a generally happy household, right? Wrong. Though they may not want to admit it, Dean and Cindy's marriage has been on the rocks for years. Dean decides to take his wife to a sex motel that ends up being more like a Star Trek motel to try to rekindle the way they used to feel about each other. The reason for their bickering is unclear until the flashbacks that have been following the main plot line give you a full understanding of why things have deteriorated so. You see them meet each other, fall madly in love, and then experience well, you'll have to see it yourself.",2010
3,"Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams were both excellent in this movie, their talent was exhibited very well which was about the only redeeming thing about this film, they played a miserable couple very well. Now that I got that out of the way, the movie itself was a renter at best. ",2011
5,"Throughout this film about a failing marriage, I wanted one question to be answered: What was the problem? Here we have a funny, loving, childlike guy married to an unhappy woman. Seems she gave up her medical career because she became pregnant before they married. Hmmm...since when does this thwart an entire career? It ain't the 50s anymore. We see through flashbacks that they were very much in love, but we do not get to know why she, not he, becomes dissatisfied with the relationship. We are expected to believe that this is how most relationships dissolve? For no particular reason, just a blah feeling about it all. This film needs a half hour of editing and a much faster pace. The dialogue is flat, and the much hyped sexually explicit scenes may be just that for prime time network TV, but not for me. I didn't see sexually explicit at all here. I asked audience members around me--all women--what her problem was. Three said that it wasn't clear to them why she was no longer in love. One suggested it was probably because he smokes. Another because he drinks. Another because he is immature. Hmmm...Then I asked (bothered it seemed) two other moviegoers, again women, and they looked at me puzzled. When I asked her what the wife's problem was, she said, ""You mean--what caused her problems?"" Uhm...yeah. The other said, ""Life."" And they both left. This film is not satisfying emotionally or intellectually. And it's a bore, too. When the female protagonist says that she has two children, implying that one of them is her husband, I thought--could be this is her issue then. Lame, just lame. The guy clearly loves her and their daughter, and he is clearly childlike, not childish--in fact, is is she who seems childish and selfish. Writers: be clear.",2010
10,"i saw this movie at the Sundance film festival and i can't get it out of my head. everything about it is incredibly inspired and brave and poetic. the acting is astounding (i can't remember the last time i saw 2 movie stars be so raw)... the honest, unflinching portrayal of a real relationship is something you don't see much, especially in American film, (again, the actors really deliver here)... the way the images and the music work together creates a sort of dream-scape. this movie is special. i was blown away by it. i can't wait until the release so i can see it again. i hope it is as good as i remember! and i really hope they don't get scared and change it because people need to see this in the movies!",2010
5,"This hyped-up movie turns out to be rather average. The plot is simple and universal - a young couple fall in love, they get older and more world-experienced, they fall out of love. Plot-wise, that's pretty much it.",2011
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so I was extremely surprised to be the only male in a theater with 30 plus viewers. I had not once previously thought of this as a chick flick. In fact, it is quite a weighty relationship expose' and that explains the lack of present men. What is surprising is that while the film is about the ever-so-slow crumbling of a marriage, there is no blame placed at the feet of any one person, as is so often the case in Hollywood.",2011
1,"Before you watch this film I would like you to ask yourself a question: Do you think it's a good idea to marry a girl you just met who is pregnant with the child of some other a-hole she was banging out of boredom and shame?

3,"My favorite movie reviewer is James B. If he gives a movie three stars (out of four) the odds are very good that I'll have a satisfying viewing experience. He actually gave this dog 3.5! I've never differed with him so much. If this story had been told chronologically, it would have been excruciatingly obvious that this marriage wasn't going to work out. It's as if the movie makers cut up the story board and shuffled it like a deck of cards. We find out only well into this bore that she wanted to be a doctor while he was a high school dropout and and made no bones about it. He marries her even though another guy just knocked her up. For the first half of the movie I thought she was just an impossible person; in the second half we are given a crumb as to why - he drinks in the morning and lacks ambition. And that's it. The only charming pleasant scene in the whole movie is in the trailer, him playing the ukulele and singing, but we are given precious little more to convince us they should fall in love. In fact, we're given no reason why she broke up with the previous guy, except that he came inside her and that she would never speak to him again. Everything is too sketchy. What were the things that happened along the way to make them so miserable? Instead of a storyline, we get awkwardly timed flashbacks and long, lugubrious scenes of them being miserable together. My wife and I have been married (happily) less than two years and thought this movie might provide some food for thought, things to watch out for, but this movie gives nothing of the sort. Oh well, at least it only cost us a little over two bucks each.",2011
7,"This movie is well made and realistic. However during certain scenes I was reminded of two other movies, Revolutionary Road and the Notebook. The way they move back and forth in time in Blue Valentine was similar to the movie Notebook and the emotionally depressing scenes were bit similar to the movie Revolutionary Road. So it didn't feel too original to me but still this movie had few things going on its own. Anyone who has been in a troubled relationship with the opposite sex will know how realistic this movie is but mind you it will leave you depressed. Good to see some realistic movies keep coming along the way in the midst of stupid scripts.",2012
7,"A chilling and frustrating movie that tries to say 'it's both their faults, and this is how it goes'. It shows how the worst qualities of the couple (especially the wife) come out full force against each other.",2012
4,"I didn't understand the picture, I guess, and I didn't understand a lot of the responses to it here. I found the movie sad and the female protagonist almost inexplicable. Many describe a film about a couple who were in love and fall out of love. That isn't what I saw. I saw a picture about an appealing, likable working-class man who has the misfortune to love and marry a person who doesn't love him even at the beginning of their story, let alone at the end. I can't figure out what she doesn't like about him. He's affectionate, good-looking, a devoted parent, and gainfully employed. I feel sorry for the couple's child at the end of the picture. Her dog is dead and the parent who is actually fond of the child is forced to leave.",2011

Awards season, here this film comes...",2011

This film shows everything from how a relationship forms to how it can turn into a utter nightmare.

Well I will break that down for you in the next few paragraphs.",2010
2,"This review contains spoilers - and descriptions of scenes depicted in  Srpski Film.  A baby is graphically birthed on screen by a large bald man. The mother  lies prone, and pushes the baby out into his hands. He then takes down  his underwear, and rapes the screaming newborn baby - on screen.  A man is shown violently anally raping (onscreen) a young child - his  own son, after he is injected with massive doses of a powerful sexual  stimulant. The boy - presumably also drugged - lies face-down, bleeding  profusely from his anus as the man continues a sustained sexual attack.  Evidently, this is art.  The thing that bothered me the most about Srpski Film isn't necessarily  its use of deliberate shock, and taboo busting scenes designed to  offend. It is the way in which Srdjan Spasojevic tries to cover his  dubious tracks by passing it off as some kind of artistic political  allegory about life in Serbia.  I was aware of the fact that I was increasingly annoyed as I watched  this film - mainly because the filmmakers use every trick in the book,  and obviously some new ones to batter the viewer over the head with  aggressive imagery, in order to make enough social fuss to draw in  viewers. It doesn't necessarily make it a good film, although it is  admittedly well shot, and well acted.  It almost reminded me of seeing footage of beheadings on the internet.  It's supposed to be profound in some way, but ultimately it is just  irredeemable pain and destruction, and contains no social commentary at  all.  Realistic torture and extremely graphic rape scenes usually make a  negative impact on the viewer, because they are horrific and unpleasant  subjects. Using babies and children does not make it artistic,  independent of your cultural origins - although some people claim that  it is art. I saw another review of this film that evidently recognised  genuine ""art"" in every single frame  I, like some of the other reviewers - have happily watched horror and  exploitation movies for years - but so what? It doesn't make any  difference whatsoever. Sub-genres come and go, and the recent tide of  shocking torture films are more akin to a test of the viewer's resolve,  than the slices of entertainment they used to be. Fair enough - if you  don't like them then don't watch.  I am a film fan. I definitely love film. I just don't love this kind of  film, or the thinly veiled attempts to disguise absolute exploitation  as something profound.",2010

I definitely recommend you stay away from it- no matter how much you love ""shock"" movies, or if you can take ""sick, shocking stuff"". Mind you, I can stand shock movies. One of my top films of all time, Cannibal Holocaust, is a film that is considered a ""shock"" film, but it's more than just a film with shock scenes, as the ending challenges the viewer to question our corrupt morals nowadays. A Serbian Film does not do that at all, it exists only to subject its viewer to ugly, vile, and repugnant stuff that would make the Saw movies look like a teddy bear's picnic.",2011
6,"I've written a book and some articles about film censorship, so given the controversy looming around this particular film, and its highly interesting release history in the UK (read wikipedia for more), I got my hands on a pre-release uncensored copy. What's very interesting is that apart from some suggestive shots hinting at pedophilia and the extension of the film's most gruesome, unforgettable scene, it's all there, only left to the imagination - leaving me with the question I've come up with whenever confronted with such a case: if censorship leaves certain aspects to the spectator's imagination, isn't the effect even more stimulating?

9,"First, I want to say that I disagree with everyone who argues that this movie is simply made for explicit shock value with no other purpose. I can quarrel this with two simple points: 1. I am a male porn performer myself and immediately found there to be a handful of real concepts, thoughts, and fears to relate with Milos on within the first fifteen minutes of the film (desensitization, your position in a family setting as a pornographer, to take the job or not to take the job, etc). Now, I'm sorry if you have no way of grasping that he is a realistic and admirable character in believable shoes, but he is. The level of relation I found with Milos shocked and impressed me and made me wonder if either that screenwriter had had some personal experience as a porn performer in the past, or instead was just a really intelligent person who was able to grasp it without actually experiencing it.",2011

Though director is known for his appreciation of unconventional film making, I could never imagine that anyone with good mental health would ever direct, produce and star in such a film. The amount of sodomy, violence and deviance is unbelievable. Having sex with a woman while beating her and chopping her head off while still doing it; delivering a newborn baby and immediately forcing it to oral or any kind of sex (yes I do realize it was not an actual baby, but still); not to mention the scene including the ""actor"", his brother, his wife and his own son ...

So now you must be wondering, well why did I watch A Serbian Film knowing what it was about then come on here and give it a bum rap. Well. I heard of it through friends and websites, and being a lover of horror movies, and a fan that likes to ""have seen it all"" I obviously was going to watch A Serbian Film sooner or later. First of, don't get me wrong, it's not the violence in this movie that makes me dislike it, it's how they tried to be so over the top about it, and in doing so, it makes it look like a futile piece of crap.

The premise for this little shocker is simple, a semi-retired porn star is lured back to his profession to do this once in a lifetime shoot so he can make lots of money and secure his family, but he has no idea what the shoot will contain, so we the viewer have a birds eye view in the dark and very murky journey he goes through, as the porn shoot becomes more extreme he begins to realise what he's got himself into and the director has a shocking surprise for his lead actor in what he wants him to do, not to spoil anything (its a taboo busting subject) but lets just say that if you put Cannibal holocaust, Irreversible, Emanuel In America, and Martyrs in a blender, throw a baby in the mix and you have an idea what your letting yourself in for.....I know some people will be very upset watching this film and some people will demand that this film be banned, there are some scenes of extreme sexual violence that will anger some of the mainstream crowd, i just hope that the censors will leave this film the way the director intended.. Be cautious when you see this movie, if it gets a proper release this film will get mixed reviews, it will be sure to divide people apart and thats the beauty of this controversial film, love it or hate it, you will never forget it.

1,"I'm not easily offended, and in fact I like edgy movies, but this film is totally sick. What is sad about it is that the director is not untalented, and for the first hour this seems to be a very good if disturbing movie. Unfortunately, the last half hour goes downhill in the most sickening way. In Serbia, Milos, a former porn legend, currently out of work and living a family life with a wife and a small kid, is tempted with huge money to step out of retirement to participate in a new kind of artsy porn film. He is not told the argument of the movie (as if porno films have such things) and the mysterious director, one Vukmir, seems totally off the rocks. But since he needs the money he agrees to do it. Unfortunately, his misgivings turn out to be very true, since he is soon forced to participate in increasingly degrading acts, a nonstop parade of horrors (including, and I suppose I'm giving some spoilers here, killing a woman with a machete while he is having intercourse with her, the rape of a baby and of his own small kid) for which he will eventually take revenge. As I said, I think there is some talent here, but is so sick that is not worth it.

But sooner he finds that Vukmir and his crew are involved in sick snuff films of pedophilia, necrophilia and torture and there is no way back to him and maybe it is too late to protect his family.

8,"Lets get one thing straight from the start. No one got hurt and no child was on set and saw anything sexual or violent in the making this film. This is not in any way child porn as some people who obviously either haven't seen the film or are retarded have commented . Its nothing like Cannibal Holocaust , Visitor Q ( ? ) , or anything else its been compared to. I can totally understand that this film is a form of catalyst to try and purge the memory of what went on in all the violence seen in the wars that split Yugoslavia  I saw things on TV at that time that were as bad as things seen in this film  I will never forget the sight of a little girl being taken from the wreckage of a bombed school, her arm hanging by a small piece of flesh having been blown off  I'll never forget that. The fact is that it does happen in war  And probably all the things you will see in this film have happened in Iraq recently  Backed by our disgusting governments and multi-nationals  Its what happens when you give men ( and women ) nothing but encouragement to be the animal inside  They become animals. Things do occur in this movie that you never thought you would see on the screen  But its not done in any pathetic juvenile manner like in Hostel or any of those boring pieces of torture porn  In fact Eli Roth could do a lot worse than watch this and learn to make a good film. But it is not all unmitigated horror  There's a few laugh out loud moments and one great audience cheer out loud moment  Homages to Cannibal Holocaust, Nightmares in a Damaged Brain, Videodrome and countless Giallo's with the product placement. And let's be honest, the baby scene is just 2010's homage to D'Amato's ""Anthropophagus"" It's one hell of a roller coaster ride of a film that is a true piece of modern transgressive cinema. It doesn't need the hopelessly stupid camera-work that ruined "" Irreversible ""  It is intelligent rather than stupid like the second half of ' Martyrs "" which was really just a reworking of the directors earlier and far better film "" House of Voices "" The performances are great in a totally naturalistic way, apart from the one which I thought was odd  Until you see the end The only thing I would have changed was to have it stop at the end of the last shoot sequence and have a post title sequence where the survivors were on a train getting as far away as possible  I could have done without the last 5 minutes and that last line isn't THAT special But I didn't make it  Srdjan Spasojevic and his team did  And I respect his choice I'll be in the cinema on the first night watching this with an audience if it gets released in Britain  Cos there is going to be screaming and people running out and loads of fuss. But hell people  Its not real  And its so well done It's the first time I've been so affected by a film in about 15 years Its not a masterpiece  But it is Bloody Great",2010

1,"Unfortunately I have the curiosity for sick and shocking films, and after the unfortunate watch of The Human Centipede I came along to remember this movie although it's been over six months that I've seen it.

2,OK where to start with a Serbian Film...Firstly I'll say this is the most shocking piece of cinema I have ever seen. I am a fan of horror and have seen some of the more extreme films but I thought this was on a different level (and not in a good way).,2011
1,"I'm sure reading review upon review of this film does not but entice one to ponder the merit of the hype. I fell into this trap of intrigue: seeking to follow the thread of social commentary between acts of extreme sexual violence. What this movie left me with was not some esteem for the director, far from it. I felt as though his paltry attempt to associate some deep, meaningful text to this brutal waste of time was purely to stroke his 'artistic' ego as someone who felt on a deeper plane, that this was how life was to be represented to be 'felt'. The fact that social commentary on the political state of Serbia had to be infused by enlarge from outside the film-i.e. in interviews and publicity based critical exposure-shows how insignificant this message was in the actual contextual setting of the plot. If I was to take a perspective, I found this movie to be increasingly gendered and anti- feminist; playing behind the veil of politics to obscure the deeper machismo background. From the male-based rapes occurring while the victims were in an altered state of consciousness (i.e., not within himself) to the rampant use of female torture and brutality, this film pointed out-without any hint of underlying analysis or empathy-the passive nature of the feminine representation in sexual violence. Thus, if one was to take on the perspective of the director himself, the plight of Serbian censorship and society is a feminine one: a plight of deleriousness and defilement that lacks any equality in scope, associating the 'rape' of the social with the passivity of the female body. This inequality is inexcusable; and as one could argue the psychological torture endured by Milos was perhaps equal in nature, there is no basis for implying that his status as the perpetrator of horror was not enabled by his gender, and complimented by his victims female subjectivity. All in all, not even worth the text in my own evaluation. I'm simply astounded that somehow this nonsense was able to be funded and exploited into the mainstream consciousness.",2010
1,"When this movie first arrived in trailers, I like so many adults, who have become fans through our children was excited. We could overlook Pierce Brosnan playing Chiron which gets both the age and nature of the character wrong. We could overlook the character of Percy obviously being older than the books stated age of twelve, however almost everything else was so far removed from the books that have become so popular including storyline, that this movie should not even be allowed to carry the ""based on the books"" tag. The characters were completely miscast, the storyline was a weak abominational blend of books one and two..... kind of..!",2010

2,"Last night I took my 2 daughters and a friends to see the movie. All of the girls had read all the books in the series (including me) and had been anticipating the release of the movie for over a year. The book is fabulous!! I taught 4th grade for 4 years and read it to all my Language Arts classes every year. I never had a student not like the book. It contains humor, action, friendship themes, and characters that contain quite a bit of depth and growth throughout the 5 books in the series.",2010
4,Christ... ,2010
2,"OK when I went to see this movie I knew it wouldn't be exactly like the books... However, what I saw was horrendous. This movie was so awful and it's worse because they deliberately just changed all things that would make this movie at least similar to the book. First... I do not agree with ANY of the casting. Did anyone else notice they left out Ares and Clarrise out? So how are they going to explain her mission if they get so far as that movie? They also left out Dionysus... Why? They left out Thalia's tree.. So in the next movie when Grover leaves and her tree is poisoned how will it be explained? This is the problem that Harry Potter has... Leaving out important things to add fluff and special effects let's face it the last HP movie sucked. They also changed unnecessary things. Like Chiron being a white centaur. Or Mrs. Dodds being a MATH teacher. Changing the layout of the camp. Even changing the story of how Luke got the shoes. Fail as a movie. Last I have more to complain about bit why cut out Kronos since it all ends with him? Idk this just sucked! Horribly!",2010

1,"I'm speechless. Truly speechless. If there is a bottom in modern day movies, it lies within the abominable pile of feces that is Percy Jackson the lightning thief. Enter America through the coughed up hair ball that is Percy Jackson (aka. Zac Efron #2), as his immoral adventures lead us through every known America-promoting scene, cliché and famous American destination (need I remind that we are dealing with Greek mythology). I didn't know Olympus resided on the top of the empire state building, or that the underworld was accessible through under the widely known landmark that is the Hollywood sign... This movie has as many flaws as acting careers it will namely destroy. This is what happens when you throw too much money at a dog with rabies and expect it to direct a movie. The leftover money that was thrown at this movie could surely feed the entire world for a century. I'm not sure if I should blame the book, or the movie, for it's inconsistent and illogical storyline. The acting is bad. The characters are shallow and predictable. The editing is horrible, just an example of a scene where Percy's mother is about to tell the truth to Percy about his father, outside being dusk, and then the scene cutting to night time, where she begins the actual explaining. The editors have clearly not watched the movie a second time to bother with flaws, who can blame them, I wouldn't. If you want to have a good laugh with your friends about the movies anus of a presentation, I recommend it. If you want to watch an interesting fantasy adventure about Greek mythology combined with present day, go read a history book and make movie about it with your cellphone cam and toilet paper as a script, and I guarantee you will gain more satisfaction than you would receive from this diarrhea of a movie.",2010
1,"The movie failed to represent the book. I would say about 20% of the movie kept to the story line of the book and the rest is new, or altered content. They changed everything from the plot, to the characters. Major characters such as Clarise and Ares were left out altogether along with the plot contributions'of those characters. The different cabins that are repeatedly spoken about throughout The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series weren't represented.Percy never spoke to the Oracle to receive his quest to recover the bolt. There wasn't even a mention of Kronos plotting against the gods in the movie.This movie could have represented the books story much better than it did. Overall, I was disappointed in the movie because the storyline from the book was much better.",2010
4,"I've never been a big fan of Greek mythology, so based upon that criteria I've never been a big fan of movies about the subject. Though I have grown to be pretty fond of the book series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I was astounded at how well Greek mythology was interwoven into the modern day culture as author Rick Riordan told a rip-roaring adventure tale, filled with humor, mystery, and tons of action. Like all things successful, Hollywood likes to get in the game, so it's no surprise that a film has been made of the first of the Percy Jackson books, The Lightning Thief. The film, Percy Jackson and the Olympians - The Lightning Thief, seems to have lost something in the translation, winding up as a film that really only shares the name of the book and nothing else.",2010
3,"It's one thing to change around the plot a little bit and leave out sub plots that are in the movie, but they basically just kept the ending (somewhat).

1,"This movie is probably the worst,if not the worst, movie for following its original plot. I mean I've seen some movies that take the cake but this movie was by far the worst. I'm not trying to be rude its an OK movie but if you read the books its horrible. I know plenty of people who read the books and were all excited to see the movie only to walk out annoyed by how much they changed. They changed everything in it from Annabeth's hair color to the villains and even most of the story line. It was like someone read the back cover of the book and made a movie off of that. The book is an amazing read and Rick Riordan is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors what with his wacky sense of humor he likes to put in his books, which sadly didn't make it to the movie either.",2011

She stormed out half way through out in a fury! Do these people not read the books before they decide to create movies? There are so many flaws and missing characters. Hey remember Ares? He's the main antagonist and yet he's not even in the movie! Don't take your kids they will be disappointed. We will not go see any more of the Percy Jackson movies and I am writing as many parents as possible to let them know not to waste their money. For an author to create such a wonderful series of books that has inspired kids about Greek Mythology and let Hollywood once again screw the story up is a sin. I guess once again it's all about the money, not about the story or the craft. To quote my daughter who was near tears with anger, ""It was awful, the worst movie ever!""",2010
1,"I was so excited when the movie came out seeing as it took me only a few days (for a working mother with a lot on her plate) to read the first book. What I didn't know was that you were going to trash the movie with terrible actors and the wrong storyline! Did you even read the book?! I understand that the book was somewhat lengthy and there were parts that could have easily been removed for the movie, in fact I was prepared and fine with that. Where was Aries????? He was the bad guy! Where was the plot from Kronos????? This was the WHOLE point of the story, Kronos sends the dreams to everyone and starts the ball rolling. Luke is a minor part of evil and was never meant to be the master mind! MAJOR MAJOR SCREWUP on your part Mr. Columbus. Don't even get me started on the small inconsistencies...what happened to no cell phones, Persephone isn't even in the book, the Helm of Darkness, etc. This movie gets my vote for worst movie of the year and I wish I could return it to the store! Terrible, I'm disgusted with you, you should be ashamed. Read the book next time...Jeez!",2010
7,"Most people say 'don't judge a book by its movie.' I think both the book and movie in this situation are great. I was a little upset with the things that were changed, and the characters that were left out. Like Clarrise, and Thalia's tree. I was also disappointed that there was no prophecy, or Mr. D, or oh the list could go on. I thought the plot was changed to make for a better movie, because books don't always go over well to movies. I thought the acting was good, but some people were cast for the wrong parts, like I don't think Sean Bean fit the part of Zeus. There weren't as many jokes and funny moments as there were in the books, but the few they had sufficed. The one thing I reallllllllllllly dislike though, is how people compare it to Harry Potter. I'ma big fan of Harry Potter myself, but they are in complete different ball parks. Like I saw in an interview a guy said ""Oh, I like Harry Potter more."" UGH. How would YOU feel if someone said that about YOUR book or movie?! Overall, I really liked the movie, and I love the books. I think the movie works better just as a stand-alone movie, like its good if you haven't read the book as well.",2010
7,"I recently read the book series (out of boredom), so I saw this film today with my friend. Firstly, it is quite different from the book. A major part of the storyline was completely left out (or even discarded), some parts were removed, and random parts added that did nothing for the storyline whatsoever. The beginning of the movie felt rather rushed, and hearing the 'whhaat?' from my friend confirmed the fact that they don't really explain things much in the first place. Anyone who might've recently studied Greek mythology or like to read about it as a general interest..it might make more sense to. Otherwise, it would seem a little random.",2010

With the Lord of the Rings making Hollywood studios go into a frenzy in adapting the many fantasy books out there, not everything Tinseltown touched turned to box office gold, and more often than not, save for that famous boy wizard, what could have been pilots of franchises, became no more than false starts. I suppose it goes to show that a solid story is still fundamental, other than making yet another special effects extravaganza to try and wow a growingly jaded audience.",2010
7,"TRON: Legacy has been one of the most promoted films of the year. With a monstrous budget (around $200 million) and reports saying that Disney is worried that the film isn't tracking as well as they'd hoped, the initial thought process from these rumors is that the TRON sequel will open to a disappointing first place weekend much like the most recent Chronicles of Narnia film. As of this writing, I haven't gotten around to seeing the original film. I wanted to, but thanks to Disney it was pretty much pulled from every retail store imaginable whether you wanted to rent or purchase the film at least until next year. The urge to see TRON: Legacy didn't really sink in until around the time the third trailer was released. While the Daft Punk score has interested me from the beginning, TRON: Legacy just seemed like another overrated piece of eye candy that fan boys were getting excited about.

The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in.",2010

The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside ""The Grid"" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast.

Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more, even if it wasn't a bad film per se (personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt they left out too much). Half-blood Prince -while visually stunning- did not capture the brilliance of the book. With ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", I think the makers have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that was both fun to watch for casual viewers while also catering to the needs of the hard-core fans who know the books by heart. The decision to split the movie into two parts may be judged as a financial one by some, but I'm convinced it was the only possible way to make this work.

Most of the film is flat and dull, with none of the charm and detail of the book and as much as I usually love the actors, I didn't feel any connection to the characters. After all the hype and success of the other films, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I was a big disappointment. I can only hope that Part II makes up for it.",2011

Also, there's a scene where Harry and Hermione dance that is supposed to be poignant, but I found it endless and pointless. I can't remember the last time I saw a non-musical movie which included a complete song. Usually they are shortened to show the highlights and move the story along, but not Deathly Hallows.

""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. ",2010
9,"After having seen HP6, I honestly didn't have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier, as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn't give you the feeling of a coherent work - I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However, I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.",2010

With sometimes years between each subsequent release, my memory of the litany of events preceding them is often shaky at best, and I've never felt particularly inclined to re-visit.",2010
4,"This is not a Harry Potter movie. It is a movie that has characters with the same names and faces but they are in an alternative universe, one created by David Yates starting in movie 5. In that universe, all the themes and ideas developed in the book-based Harry Potter mythology are gone. In its place is a story about an individual boy wizard and his teen friends. What happened to the great choices Harry has to make, like does he go after the Horcruxes as Dumbledore instructed or does he get sidetracked looking for the Deathly Hallows? Horcruxes are thrown in as a McGuffin, an excuse to take a group camping trip rather than as the key to the whole mystery: how do you destroy evil without destroying yourself. The Hallows are the great temptation that the animation in this movie beautifully suggests but then they are completely ignored for the rest of the movies. Remember that Dumbledore and Gregorovich once had a notion of ""The Greater Good"" and that idea did not die with the end of their friendship. Dumbledore tried to teach Harry that what he was doing was not for himself, it was for the greater good of all beings, not just pure-bloods, and certainly not just for teenagers. Okay, did you get any of this from this movie? NO, because it has all been washed out of the story and replaced with silly teen anxieties and individual relationships. How very sad.",2010

5,"I love the Harry Potter films. I have never read the books and probably never will. The films have been breathtaking, brilliant, beautiful, with one of the greatest ensemble casts I have ever seen. They didn't just play their roles but single handedly embodied them. So I was excited and sad to see this second last instalment of the last great fantasy epic. How disheartening to discover that this was nothing more than a forced first part to the two part finale to squeeze more money out of the franchise. 95% of all the characters that made this series incredible are gone. The action, special effects, and brilliant fantasy is practically nil. I read several reviews on IMDb and some loved it and many hated it and the ones who hated it said the same things I thought about it. The starring cast spend the entire film 'warping' out of trouble and into forest. ""Harry Potter goes camping"" as one reviewer called it. The amazing supporting cast from previous instalments get virtually no time on screen and the entire 2 1/2 hour film could have been summarized into a half hour before the final film. I can barely summarize how disappointed I was in how they created this filler film.",2011
8,"Right from the very start, when the Warner Bros logo appears, this film feels different. The colours are gray and muted, the sound is a low rumble and even the famous theme from John Williams seems to have given way to a much darker drone. It doesn't even feel like a Harry Potter movie anymore. It makes the first Chris Columbus movies feel like they are from a whole different universe. And this feeling stayed with me right until the end For the last few instalments of the series (possibly from number 3 onwards) we've been hearing a lot of ""this one is darker"" type of lines being bantered about, whether from the critics, the fans or even the film-makers themselves. But it's never been more true than in this final chapter.",2010

I thought the tension build up was very good throughout the movie, I liked seeing the characters being slightly more matured. There are some new kind of 'special effects' in the movie, which was kind of weird to me at first, but I guess it fitted the story. I can't wait to see part two , even though I know what will happen.",2010

With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo, where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince, things get a lot worst here from the start, where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic, before we see Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.",2010
1,"Without a doubt the worst Harry Potter film yet, and this is somebody who didn't like the last three entries in the series, either. The decision to split the seventh book into two parts mean that this one is long winded and preoccupied with needless trivia. The first, better half is similar to ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and HALF BLOOD PRINCE in that it tries to cram too much into too short a space of time. It's all about the detail, and any attempts at atmosphere or suspense are bypassed in favour of storytelling (and don't get me started on the lameness of the horcrux plotting). The second half of the film involves one long camping trip in the woods, spicing things up with a little sexuality and violence. It's as dull and pointless as it sounds.",2011

10,"A few months ago, a friend of mine showed me a grainy YouTube video of the ""Adventure Time"" short that was shown on Nickelodeon. I immediately fell in love with the short and we began reading up all about since we just learned it was being adopted by Cartoon Network. What we found out and watched blew us away. The amount of thought and imagination put into this show is astounding. I have never remained entertained for an entire episode of a show before, let alone an entire season! The wild and wacky aspects are quite entertaining but also do not remove anything from the ongoing plot and story. We see how characters develop and even see how moral choices produce themselves to challenge the duo, Finn and Jake, along the way. Though they stumble, this imaginative and amazing (not to mention post-apocalyptic) world always seems to lead back to the path of righteousness which is exactly where this show is.",2010

10,"I very rarely find anything on TV or in film that makes me laugh as frequently and unexpectedly as this show. Adventure Time is a well needed breath of life into cartoons. What impresses me most is that the humour is very mature but unlike other shows of that nature, for example Ren & Stimpy, it's still completely for the children. That's where the magic lies. When watching you become a kid again, immersing you in the imagination all of us shared as a youngster. ",2010
10,"First of all I really don't like cartoon network... or at least when they keep on showing stupid kid shows. This is what makes Adventure Time so special is that it is pretending to be a kid's show in appearance but in reality it is quite mature and isn't really for kids. All of the episodes I have seen are funny except for one. The characters are all likable and there seems to be a dark side to every character. Finn is the main character and is the ONLY human in the entire show. There are hints that this is the far future, and humanity was destroyed (you see destroyed cities under water, or a river of garbage). Finn is tries his best at being a good hero, but sometimes they he seems to hurt some innocent people. Jake is his side kick dog who is really great because his voice is perfect, and he is just laid back and relaxed. Princess Bubblegum is the good princess who Finn likes, and she is super smart and is ruler of the candy kingdom. She seems to have a dark side that appears every once in a while. The Ice King is a common protagonist. It bothers me that everyone hates him, and kind of attacks him for no reason. It is often seen that he steals princesses because he only wants to be happy, and basically the reason he does anything is because he is so lonely.",2011
8,"I love it. I think this show is very creative and imaginative. The characters, the writing, and the setting is awesome. I love the character designs and the dialog is hilarious.

The animation is approachable enough that the youngest viewers will be captivated by the vivid colors and unique characters like the lovable B-Mo, a cute little thing that resembles an old school Nintendo Gameboy. Their parents however will be treated to sly humor such as a character singing the theme song to ""Cheers"" to keep himself from giving in to the insidious power of his crown. There are some images that may frighten very young viewers, after all, the show is set in a post-apocalyptic world that is eerily similar to our own with the exception that the Land of Ooo is populated with vampires, witches, eccentric kings, and all manner of magical beasts(talking candy and baked goods, unicorn rainbows, your imagination was never so fully realized).

I do understand that some people will not enjoy Adventure Time and be as passionate about it as I am, but that is mostly because those people have bad taste. I especially enjoy the bright colors and simple illustration in Adventure Time, and I guess that that is something that can turn people off of the show because they want their cartoons to look like complicated video games or Avatar or something. I also enjoy the humor in Adventure Time and its very clever and witty. Sometimes it can be inappropriate but whatevs. I love Adventure Time so much that i am strongly considering marrying it if at all possible.",2012

The lowest rated episode is only a 5.6/10, like The Cleveland Show got (It's also stupid, but enjoyably stupid). So flip all you haters, you should all be happy this show got an 8.8/10.

There is never a boring moment in this show. The characters are funny and have funny catch phrases. The characters are all so different and most are magical. Some characters include Finn the human, who happens to be the last human on earth, Jake the dog, a magical talking dog who has stretching powers, Marceline, who is the vampire queen and sings and plays the bass, and Princess Bubblegum, who's an extremely smart princess made of bubblegum. I record this show and look forward to the new episodes every week. This show makes me laugh and just is really entertaining and fun, for all ages. Don't Judge it before you watch it.

Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.",2010

Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.",2017
10,"Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!).

First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety.",2010

What makes it worse is that this is based on true events. So lets recap for a moment...",2012
9,"I am a big of David Fincher's work, when I realized he was going to make a film about the creation of Facebook, I was really excited. I came in the movie with huge expectations, and hopeful that it would turn out great. I have to say, I was impressed, my expectations were not only met, but they were blown away. The Social Network easily rivals Fincher's previous works like ""Fight Club"" or ""Se7en"".",2011
10,"I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as ""The Facebook movie"" is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.",2010
3,"The Social Network is contrived, artificial and overlong, but it didn't have to be. There were the makings of a really absorbing movie, using the very timeless themes of betrayal and greed; however, those opportunities were repeatedly squandered. The dialogue was characteristic of Sorkin, with the actors continually speaking over each other, spouting bon mots that rang hollow because they had no time to register. When a simple statement with a few words would suffice and be much more powerful, Sorkin stuffed in multiple sentences that rendered the scene lifeless. Sometimes silence is the most powerful indicator of feeling. ",2010
9,"So there I was, sitting in the cinema waiting to see 'Inception' greeting every belated trailer with a groan, each one prolonging the time till I could finally see one of the most anticipated movies of the year and there it was, I turned to one of my friends ""my god..a film about facebook?!.."" To say I was skeptical for those few moments would be an understatement, I was almost angry, like a footballer who releases an autobiography 5 years after he starts his career I just didn't understand the timing of it, who cares anyway?",2014
7,"Maybe I'm too old. No, not maybe, I am. I saw this characters as aliens of sorts. I know they represent today's landscape, brrrrr. The film as a film is one of the best of David Fincher but the universe it explores gave the chills. A world approaching its end, fast. The youth of the characters made it even more sinister. I couldn't detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me. Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he'll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets. How I wish this was merely a science-fiction film.",2010
2,"After forty-five minutes of listening to ""snappy"" dialogue delivered at a billion miles per hour I wanted to throw a brick at the screen, but only because the main character wasn't available in person.",2011
7,"Facebook and the Internet in general is a massive part of today's world, so making a film on this subject seemed like an interesting idea.",2013
4,I was very disappointed with this Oscar-nominated film of 2010. It basically has many of the antics of the old college films. The only difference here is the intellectual connotation due to the rise of the facebook technological theme.,2011
1,Ultimately there is no reason why I or you should need to watch it at all (let alone again).,2011
4,"Bit behind but still.. the film ""The Social Network"" annoys me, ""based on a true story"" that really made it seem (after multiple accusations) that Zuckerberg didn't steal the whole idea of facebook and that he really had it hard to get there. Who's to say the two people, supposedly trying to steal his idea in the film, didn't create it and the way they were portrayed as arrogant money-grabbers is unfair, who's to say Zuckerberg wasn't the idea thief, the arrogant money grabber. Whom, now he has all the money decides to further discredit the other two by funding a film about himself. He's already proved himself as the arrogant one.",2013
6,Cinema students rejoice. Here is an American film worthy of critical analysis and close examination.,2011
6,"Internet site Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in Jessie Eisenberg's lanky shape is not a very sympathetic figure: a fast-babbling and socially awkward misfit who was dumped by his girlfriend, and whose embryo of FB started out as a good looking girls-ranking site as a pure act of revenge the same night as the break-up. Progressively, his character traits extend to a reckless million dollar entrepreneur of an unparalleled success concept of social media. Director David Finchers & scriptwriter Aaron Sorkins interpretation jumps between the legal process in the present (where his former college friends intend to sue the crap out of him, mainly for stealing the idea) and the skyrocketing rise of the Internet phenomenon in the past.",2011
5,"There is something wrong with this film like it was put though a filter of some type to remove any real humanity, unless that is the point. I'm not a psychiatrist but Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in the film seems to suffer from some kind of emotional agnosia. . .and so does the film.",2010
10,"I have been a fan of David Fincher ever since I saw Se7en when I was 13. I saw all of his films the following week and not one of them disappointed me. That was back in 2003. I loved Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as well, but he really knocked it out of the park with this one. I was fortunate enough to see The Social Network at a screening on 9/16/10 for my college. Eisenberg, Hammer and Sorkin were there and did a Q and A after the film. It was a GREAT experience. All of them seemed excited about the film and rightfully so. The film brilliantly tells the story of college students who go through hell with each other over the credit for Facebook and the damage that comes to all of them because of it. The acting and dialogue were flawless. Eisenberg, Garfield and even Timberlake churn out performances that should get them serious attention come award time. Fincher's direction is also perfect. you can always tell a Fincher film when you see it because his visual style is so striking and The Social Network is no exception. When this is released, please go see it and watch a film that defines a generation and what the world has become.",2010
1,"The writing, the acting, the music, the bad lighting. All over rated. The opening scene is the worst and it doesn't get better. I usually like Jesse Eisenberg but he is totally unlikeable in this acting assignment. I usually like Trent Reznor but this score is merely annoying. I've never liked Sorkin or the West Wing but I do like Fincher and this movie does resemble some of his earlier films like The Fight Club. If Inception loses Best Picture it will be the biggest robbery since Avatar lost to The Hurt Locker. None of these people seem real. Zuckerberg should sue. These are all cut out cardboard characters.",2011
1,"*May contain spoilers* This film is far too long and too boring to hold my attention. I was trying to give this film a chance because it's supposed to be so good, but it truly just bored and disgusted me to be honest. Who wants to follow around a miserable human being like this guy playing Zuckerburg? I don't. I wanted to suffocate myself with my pillow. The first hour seemed to last an eternity. The only saving grace was seeing Rashida Jones, although I must give credit to the actors playing the twins. Those guys were great and I'd like to see them in other films. Timberlake was pretty awful in this film-trying to be some playboy-founder of Napster-type of...what? His character was not what I expected to say the least. I hated the film so much that I did not watch it all the way to the end. It was that horrible. Nothing redeeming or riveting about it. It's actually quite disgusting to see that it all started (allegedly) with him wanting to rate the girls he went to college with as hot or not (or whatever the scale/rating system was). I truly hope Zuckerburg is nothing like the way he is portrayed in this film (well, you know what I mean, at least like not how he is portrayed in the first half of the film). If anything, this film should tell viewers to LOG OFF.",2011
3,"The irony of the Social Network is....The guy who invented Facebook obviously had a reasonably high I Q. Yet the people who use it (you know those people who use the word ""awesome"" over and over and over..etc. etc.) have I.Q.s bordering on mentally challenged. Those poor things believe they have an average of 130 ""friends !!"". They are the loneliest critters on the planet. Anyway--this is a slick flick. Not a good movie but perfect for all the Facebook fans who went along to see it. Jesse Elsenberg is brilliant playing the horrible, distasteful Mark Zuckerberg. It did well at the box office, and must have made a fortune from the placement of well known bottles of beer. Strictly a movie that does not require multiple viewings....and a few years from now ...it will be forgotten.",2012
4,I had heard plenty of positive comments about the Social Network and have finally got around to seeing it. I must confess to being slightly disappointed.,2010
10,"There is nothing wrong about this film... there is nothing right about it either. It's just another Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and if you like these (I certainly do), you will like this movie too. If you hate them for a lack of plot or the shallowness of the jokes, you won't. I just know I laughed a numerous amount of times, and I felt good after having watched it.",2010
1,"What do you get when you put Sandler, Schneider, Rock and Spade in a ""comedy?"" The makings of a pretty good film! Sprinkle in a little Kevin James and Selma Hayek and you might have a bona fide hit on your hands. Why then, does a film like this go so awry? Why did every joke miss? Why was every character completely unlikable. There wasn't a redeeming quality to any of the characters from the start of the film and the kids that some of the characters had spawned were even worse. All around, its such a dumb film that I was actually angry with myself for sticking to it and then wasting almost two hours waiting for it to get better. ",2010
1,"This movie is terrible. What a poor excuse with all of the talent involved. I am so glad that Adam Sandler and his friends had fun making this piece of garbage. Next time include a paying audience in on the joke. It would have been nice if one joke (were there any?) would have worked. Did I mention that not one joke worked? Adam Sandler claims that he co-wrote this mess, but we all know there was never a script. Adam just called up his SNL drinking buddies and said, ""Hey, Let's take a vacation and film it for $80 million and charge people for it"". Adam Sandler plays just a lazier version of himself. There is nothing he does in his movie that is amusing, but he did manage to crack himself up in nearly every scene. So at least he has that going for him. (I know that Adam's character stepped on the line and that is why he grew up to be a jerk.) I don't think anyone told Chris Rock that they were filming a movie until after it was completed. He looks befuddled in every scene. It is a shame that he is so bad in this trash when he was so good in Death At A Funeral. His acting in this movie is the real kiss of death. Kevin James has never ever been funny and so I expected nothing from him and he delivered a grand slam. Kevin spends almost half the movie inside a KFC box. That is how embarrassed he was. Dennis Dugan did a lazy job of directing(?) this ""woodland waste"". It's like he just set the camera down and let these 5 men try to act around it. I bet he spent most of his time trying to convince the stars how funny each scene was. He should be Razzy nominated. I will skip to the end of the movie because nothing really ever happened. Out of nowhere comes not even half-baked melodrama with each couple overcoming some stupid problem. Each issue is brought up and resolved within 5 minutes and then never mentioned again! Why bother even brining it up in the first place because no one cares in the slightest. The final basketball showdown is filmed as if the entire crew fell asleep. I've seen more tension in a Dora the Explorer episode. Sandler's final lesion is worthless and really doesn't make much sense when you think about everything that has happened before it. Sandler's family was due for a loss and the evil guy was due for a win. What??? The evil guy was a jerk to everyone in the movie. And besides how do you know he was due for a win you haven't been in town for a long time. You know nothing about his life. How in the world does that insignificant game change that much? No one in the audience is buying that ending Sandler. No one. The women characters in the movie do nothing of note, are interchangeable and look as bored as they audience watching these 5 idiots try and make the lamest stuff funny. I won't mention the women by name to spare them of unfair blame. And last but certainly not least (or very least) is the acting duo (?) of Spade and Schneider. They are so bad that they make the acting in Troll 2 look Oscar worthy. Both should have to give up their SAG cards for this. I want to vomit just thinking of their acting again. They are worse then amateurs. I think both of them must be hiding a dark secret of Sandlers; otherwise why are they here. I have an idea for Adam Sandler's next movie. Please call it ""Train Wreck"". This way when it is released no one will be surprised when it sucks.",2010
2,"Some might disagree, but I'd say Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, David Spade and Kevin James is actually a pretty good main cast for a comedy. But that's also pretty much what makes the movie so frustrating, because absolutely nothing is done with them. Not only are the jokes weak and almost maddeningly predictable, the actors don't even get an actual story to work with. You can literally just erase main characters from this movie and it wouldn't affect the proceedings at all. Honestly, what does Chris Rock get to do in this movie? Can't remember a single one of his lines, really. The movie never really works up to a point, the characters have no goals, they just exist and you sit there and accept it. I really wish I could say something nice about this movie but seriously, even Steve Buscemi is bad in it. A bad Steve Buscemi. How do you do that? Very tiresome, witless comedy.",2010
1,"This is a harsh review but exactly how I feel a few hours after watching it - unhappy and depressed! I looked at the front cover of the DVD in tesco, it looked fun, was £3 and promised lots with some of the best comedy actors in the business, I was excited to see it, I love Sandler, Buscemi, Rock, James and Schneider...then...",2012

3,"I absolutely love a lot of the actors/actresses in this movie so I originally was very excited to see it. I mean, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi?? Sounds like comic gold! Nay. There was no plot & the one liners were just constant and 99.8% completely unfunny (we get it, you like to razz each other). It was almost like some of the actors even forgot how to act for this movie! I laughed a few times but pretty much spent the entire feeling like this level of comedy was insulting my intelligence. I expected more.",2011
2,"In all honesty I didn't have any high expectations for this film. I only went to see it because me and my girlfriend got into a fight and kicked me out of the house for a few hours. I had already seen Toy Story 3 and noticed today that ""Grown Ups"" would be starting in 30 minutes. I said to myself, ""What The Heck. It couldn't be any worse than the trailer of it suggested."" I was wrong. Dead wrong.",2010
7,"Lenny (Adam Sandler) and his pals Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), Marcus (David Spade), and Rob (Rob Schneider) once played on a junior champion basketball team, winning at the buzzer. Their beloved coach took them to a swanky eatery to celebrate, when they were kids, and told them to live their lives meaningfully before the ""final"" buzzer sounded. But, now, as adults, the quintet may have forgotten his words. In Lenny's household, the two sons play video games and text the nanny for refreshments all day long while his wife (Salma Hayek) works on her fashion designs. Lenny, a top agent, is living the good life but can't get his kids to go outside, not even his lovely daughter. Word arrives that coach has died and, although Lenny and family were to travel to Milan, they postpone the trip by one day to attend the funeral. Meeting up with his former friends, Lenny finds that their lives are off-track, too. Eric has gained weight and has 2 bratty children, Kurt has become a house husband, Marcus drinks too much and chases skirt while Rob is married to a considerably older woman, his fourth go around. Changing plans, Lenny rents a huge loghouse to let everyone linger a few days together, ceremoniously scatter the coach's ashes and re-connect, children, too. From hikes to swims to ""paper cup phones"", this crowd is discovering what is important, right? It would be impossible not to laugh at the good moments of this film, which seems like a long improvisation by these experts of comedy. There are some great lines and funny situations, certainly. No, its probably not the most memorable film of the year but if a feel-good experience is needed, this one should fit the bill. The cast is stellar, with all of the major actors doing fine and funny work. For the most part, too, they seem to work as an ensemble, passing around the catch phrases nearly equally. This viewer, however, wished that Rock had had a few more lines but he certainly makes the most of what he was handed. Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph, and Joyce Van Patten, as the leading ladies, support the men nicely. The scenery, from the lovely wooded home to the riverfront, is a joy and the costumes, camera-work, script and direction are above average as well. Yes, some of the humor is not appropriate for younger children so parents need to be cautious. Nevertheless, if you like Sandler, James, Rock, etc and/or you would welcome a chance to laugh with your loved ones, ante up and go see this flick soon.",2010
2,"Okay I wasn't expecting a masterpiece seeing it's an Adam Sandler movie, but come on this was as if they went the extra mile and recruited people to make it unenjoyable. There is not a single character I would deem worthwhile. It's one cliché after another: the 4 year old who still suckles his mommies breast (HA HA HA so original, and yet so hilarious...NOT); the old farting grandma; the housewife man (Chris Rock, I am more disappointed in you than in Eddie Murphy after he did Doolitle); the peeing in the pool...you know what I'm not even going to waste any more characters on this. If you still want to watch this, you're either under 14 in which case it's okay or in need of urgent medical assistance.",2011

How ever when i walked out with my friends, i was telling them, it might be one of the worst movies i ever saw. The humor is shallow and it is a pathetic attempt for laughs. Most jokes were so predictable that they lost all sense of humor about them. The directing was appalling. The story was boring. I pray that there is no Grown Ups 2. Another factor that is irritating is Adam Sandler and his pals. after the many funny movies they made it becomes repetitave and you ask yourself why cant there be a different cast for once?",2011

2,"A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing a great Adam Sandler performance in Funny People. I was telling my friends how my opinion might have started to change with Sandler and that he does have a lot of potential to be a great actor. Then my friend dragged me to see Grown Up's, Adam Sandler sent me back with this failure of a movie. My God, my head hurts from this movie, it's like Adam Sandler just sent his friends over to his vacation home and said ""Hey! See those camera's? Let's act like idiots for 2 hours and make millions of dollars by releasing the footage as a movie!"", heck, for a few million dollars I would just film how my friends and I act if I was guaranteed good money for it. Adam Sandler wrote this script exactly for his own ego, his character is successful, a great basketball player, a wonderful father, a kind man, married to Selma Hayek, rich, loving, funny do you get the point yet? This is one of the laziest and most hurtful movies I have seen this year and is a shame to the word ""comedy"".",2010
1,"What happened to the funny Adam Sandler movies? Grown Ups is proof that Adam Sandler is lazy and thinks the public will watch anything. He promoted this movie one year before the actual release date. The commercials were so embedded in our brains that we had to see the movie. Plus, what appeared to be the best cast on paper, I said ""Maybe Adam Sandler's best movie ever?"". But the movie was a fail from the start. The comedy was nowhere to be found. I wasn't even sure they were using a script in multiple scenes. Sandler must have made this movie for a big paycheck for himself and his closest SNL buddies (gross revenue $271,430,189). Oh, and so he could get his hands on Selma Hayek.",2011
1,"I think the worst thing had to be the sentimental scenes from childhood, lambasted with child humour. Completely unfunny jokes, the fact that they used other characters laughing to make you laugh because the scenes were not funny (in the church, all the characters laugh and snigger while a character sings Opera, it's not funny, but they bring in a veritable television audience to laugh in the crowd so you might laugh along, like a sheep).",2010
5,"I thought this movie was pretty dumb. Sorry, it was just silly and full of holes. This piece of garbage need the trashing it deserved. I have nothing against silly humor and have enjoyed some of the stupider films made by these actors, but this movie was just lazy. None of the characters seem like characters. It was watching the actors play as themselves with different names. With all these big names, the film directed by Dennis Dugan had great potential. But it just fell flat. This film remind me of another huge cast of comedian buddies movie. 2013's 'This is the End' works because it gave us a plot so out there that you can't help finding it funny. Both have a group of immature grown-ups that are mean-spirited and self-indulgent, but in 'This is the End', we see them punish for their answer. In 'Grown Ups', none of them go into any self-development. Why call the movie, 'Grown Ups' if none of bland, one dimensional unreliable characters truly grow more mature? If you going to keep the mean spirited humor, then why have slushy sentimentality? The movie is truly a bad version of 1983's the Big Chill. The plot is very similar to that. 'Grown ups' is about five friends who reunited for the Fourth of July holiday weekend in a camp after their junior high school basketball coach passes away. The story concept itself really had good potential, it could have been a smart comedy about childhood friends reuniting after all these years and catching up, having fun, being silly; you know, a comedy about something we could all relate to. Sadly I can't say most people can relate to them. First off, Adam Sandler plays an annoying over rich movie agent Lenny Feder marry to over the top hot woman Roxanne Chase (Salem Hayek) with spoil Paris Hilton like kids. The supporting characters are also just as annoying. Kevin James as Eric Lamonsoff was there for stupid fat jokes. I have to say Chris Rock as Kurt McKenize was under used, Rob Schneider was everybody favorite punching bag Rob Hilliard, mock because of his much older wife, and hot daughters is just a little more stupid than the others. Last is David Spade as Marcus Higgins in an unbelievable role as a womanizer and slacker who comes off as weak. Also to note, there is a lot of ex SNL cast members doing cameos in the film such as Tim Meadows, Norm Macdonald and Colin Quinn in this film. Then you got Steve Buscemi sports a cameo in the film. He look like Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He is so pale in the movie. I don't even see any of them as ex-basketball players. I don't even think they can even play basketball. Come to think of it, considering the group of people, and the theme of an old friend dying, they couldn't have come up with anything more emotionally affecting? Not like they had any real life events they could draw from. That is perplexing at best. But somewhere along that road it just took a nosedive into mediocrity. The amount of potential that was completely wasted here is mind-blowing. Jokes about potentially life-threatening injuries are still considered funny in Hollywood somehow. There is plenty of stupid slapstick humor, and prat falls to make any Jackass fan happy. Who in their right mind think arrow roulette is great idea? Other jokes fell flat to me too. I just turn off by the urinating, poop, and breast milk jokes. The worst had to be the animal getting hurt by the fat guy joke. Why are animals getting hurt a sign of humor? It's like dead baby humor, it's too dark for suppose family picture like this. If he going to have dark humor. Why can't we have some sophisticated dark humor? I have to say Big Daddy and 50 First Dates were decent so this movie could have been better. It felt like watching Adam Sandler hang out with his friends doing stupid stuff for an hour while somebody left the camera on. I know comedy movies such as this are suppose to be enjoyed, not ripped apart and analyzed. Critiques need to realize that it's entertainment, and as long as it is entertaining, it's might be a effective movie. Still, I wasn't entertain. Rather than watching this movie, I think people should just go outside and make their own friends, because watching this is just too lame. It's like watching a bunch of frats boys. A sequel indeed came out in 2013, titled 'Grown Ups 2'. Unfortunately it's worst then this movie. Sure if you look at it from a mature perspective it wasn't that great of a movie, but if you look at it from the immature, good sense of humor perspective, you might find it funny. I try to look at it immaturely, but the jokes weren't catching me. Like I said before, I found more humor in 'This is the End' then this. Unfortunately, supported to the end was the same - shallow atmosphere. Almost nothing was learned. The moral at the end was ""convex"" as the entire movie. I do not recommend, but it is worth watching, you want a stupid movie to watch. I saw it in theaters at the behest of a friend who enjoyed it, and went in with really low expectations, and if you set your standards low enough and turn off all brain function, the movie is actually watchable. If not, then you agree with my statements.",2013
2,"I am a huge Sandler, Rock, Spade, Hayek, Buscemi and I even like some Rob Schneider stuff but this movie made me laugh exactly ZERO times. I actually find it offensive in many scenes like the ""sexy man"" at the water park, the ladies ogle him and then when he speaks they laugh in his face. What was that? Then the 3 daughters with the third one not being an incredibly hot supermodel like the first two, why diminish someone based on looks? This movie is what is wrong with movies nowadays. I remember them promoting this movie on Howard Stern and they claimed it ""was this summer's The Hangover"". WOW were they off! The movie was vapid, childish and unnecessarily stupid but the worst part was that absolutely none of it was funny unless you find cruelty hilarious. This was no Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, or Big Daddy, this is the worst movie Adam Sandler has ever put out. I saw rumors they are making a SEQUEL! Tip for viewers of the sequel, if they start the movie in a funeral and they make incredibly stupid cruel ""jokes"", just get up and demand your money back. Save yourself the rest of the time you'll waste on this movie.",2012

We've got Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider all in the brew as friends who grew up together and are reunited during a Fourth of July family weekend as adults... and not one damn thing that's worthwhile or humorous ever occurs! This one's a real mess. Terrible script, aimless ideas and situations scattered all over which don't amount to anything. There's potential in this ensemble, but it was a wasted opportunity. Even worse, what should have been a situation centered solely on the five guys and their male reunion is compromised by also featuring their wives and children, all of whom are even more boring than they are. I was tipped off in advance to the worthlessness of this movie from a reliable friend who'd suffered through it, but recently someone visiting me brought a free DVD copy to the house so we took the chance.

Adam sandler and the rest of them seem to be sleepwalking through this movie, We managed 40 minutes of it until we looked at each other wondering why we were wasting a perfectly good evening watching this rubbish.

10,"I had the opportunity to see Black Swan in one of the 18 theaters that it opened up on this weekend, although I generally do not do so, I was compelled to write a review of the film.",2010
5,"Based on the commercials for Black Swan, I walked into the theater expecting to see a film about a career ballerina who is forced to access her repressed dark side in preparation for her role as the swan queen and cracks under the pressure. Instead, the film I saw was about a meek young woman who's possibly schizophrenic and certainly on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the opening reel. There's no real drama because Nina is already broken. All that's left is for the viewer is to watch her become increasingly unhinged.",2011
9,"Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession. Obsession for beauty, fame, and above all, perfection. We are shown glimpses of its splendor, only to be consumed by the ugliness and harsh reality that is the world of professional ballet.",2010
10,"Yeah, it must be Darren Aronofsky, at it again. I'm certain I've just seen a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but at the same time I feel like I've just been run over by a convoy of trucks. It will be a while before I calm down enough to sleep, so here I am.",2010

1,"My biggest gripe about this movie is the fact the Portman character has all the presence and self-confidence of a puddle. In real life, no production company would allow someone with so little confidence to assume the top role. Millions of dollars are at stake and investors would need to be confident that the lead could handle the more difficult"" Black Swan"" role, upfront. No one would allow weeks of crying and hallucinations, right up till opening night (and even late for that) to prove that they can actually do the job. Also, the big flub in the first act would have likely caused the second to take her place. Obviously, someone with the low self-esteem (demonstrated by the Portman character) could never hope to gain even a minor role with a ballet company, and certainly not the lead. The competition is just too stiff. Also, Portman does not have the correct body type and is a little short at only 5'3"". The boiled chicken and fresh-plucked look was also a big turn-off. In real life, someone so mechanical and fearful would never make it to the top ranks. A second-string ""Rockette"" has more stones than the Portman character.",2011
1,"Well, I lost track. Seriously. I am still astonished at the high rating it had here at IMDb (which rarely lets me down) as that is what encouraged me to go.",2011
1,"When a movie is being hyped to a substantial degree, there is always a risk that this is not exactly due to its merit, but rather part of an aggressive marketing campaign. Rarely has such a phenomena been so obvious as prior to the release of 'Black Swan': the media have been up and running about Portman's real-life romance sparked during its filming, plus pondering the chances of 'Black Swan' establishing ballet as a fashion trend. Still, having been partnered with a dancer for a number of years, I couldn't resist the temptation - as a result of which I have to side with those reviewers here who regard it as an utterly pointless affair.",2011
1,"Thumbs down. I've compared this movie to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, that is if Mr. Hyde went M.I.A. It was self-indulgent, over-rated and for my money, a waste of time. Sure, Natalie Portman deserves credit for losing 20 pounds and learning some dance moves, but, her acting was flat. Most of the film she played Nina as the Naive, frustrated woman the role required. However, where was the redemptive aggression of the Black Swan? That would have been an action challenge! It was reduced to a few scenes at the end. Wasn't that the whole point of the film? It felt like, ""OK, we're almost out of money so let's wrap this up."" And don't try to label the movie sophisticated or artsy. Please!!!! There's no more sophistication here than a skin-flick on Cinemax. Just because Nina grows wings on stage and her eyes turn red does not make an art-house masterpiece. And the tired lesbian scene is so gratuitous and, frankly, offensive. Yep, another gay predator trying to take the good straight girl to the dark side. I believe this story could have been told beautifully. And not all of it is bad. The music was good and some of the dance scenes were believable. I also liked the camera-work. But, somehow - let's blame the screenwriter and the director - it all turns into a boring cliché': resentful mother pushing her daughter to the brink, lesbian sex-scene, the older man/younger women love triangle, etc. Can anyone tell an original story anymore? Boring! As for Portman, she will win the Oscar for ""Black Swan,"" however, she should have won it for ""Closer.""",2011
8,Natalie Portman lives a dream and a nightmare when she gets a chance to dance Swan Lake in Darren Aronofsky's new film,2010

1,"The worst thing about the very bad 'Swan' is that, somehow, people think it's a brilliant film. The best thing is that it makes you wish somebody would really center a great film in the fascinating world of ballet. This...ain't it. I read this script was developed over ten years. Really? Ten years in which to create a cartoon, horny, bombastic company director, spouting clichés about 'passion' and 'letting go'? Ten years, and no one notices that Nina has no character at all? Ten years, and it seemed plausible that a blatantly frightened, whiny dancer should get the lead in 'Swan Lake'? Quite honestly, I kept waiting for this film to actually begin; only when the absurd death-drive ending was tacked on did I realize it was over. Utterly bad, all the way, and mostly because we get no sense of Portman's identity WHATSOEVER. More exactly, there is no foundation upon which to build either the dark side's emergence from her, OR her horror of it. Other reviews here rightly point out the idiocies, as in a star ballerina being 'fired' and in drunken shock over it, or an alternate lead selected so late in the game, or a director engaging in conduct that would get any artistic director out on his ass in a heartbeat, no matter the artsy milieu. All of that would have been bearable, had there been any notion even hinted at of what and who Nina is. Nothing. So weird stuff happens to this non-character, there's a ridiculously gratuitous lesbian fantasy, you early on don't freak over the blood because, after five minutes, you know it's in her head, and then she achieves perfection in death. And you don't care at all. PS How bad? I kept longing to see Barbra Streisand take the stage in a tutu, saying, 'You vanna kill a swvan? Dese lovelies?'",2012
9,"Darren Aronofsky proves once again that he is an absolute genius in the modern world of cinema and he can work in any genre and make it look beautiful, real, visceral, and always keeping with his specific visual style, proving himself to be an absolute auteur. Black Swan is Aronofsky's fifth feature film, and it shows how his directing ability is somehow getting better. The movie is about a ballet dancer, Nina (Natalie Portman), who is dealing with the pressures of playing The Swan Queen in her companies production of Swan Lake. The pressures brought about by this demanding role cause her to begin to slowly crack under pressure, especially when she has to worry about a rival dancer possibly taking her spot. My synopsis doesn't do the film any justice though, and the result of this story is a disturbing and breath taking thriller that combines beauty with visceral intensity, and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the screen.",2010
10,"Perfection is a state of completeness and flawlessness. How many of you have known a perfectionist or you yourself feel the need to be perfect at all times? To the point where it almost drives you or the person insane? But to be honest, I think we've all had those moments of wanting to be perfect. Praised as one of the best films of the year, Darren Aronofsky takes us into the psyche of another character, I would say that this is my favorite film by him. At a young age he has come so far in creating some of cinema's most fascinating characters and stories, he's given us such amazing films. His vision brings out one of the year's best films and one of my new favorites, he and Natalie Portman were meant to work together. I absolutely adore Natalie Portman, but I have been waiting for her to have a role as challenging as Black Swan, her intelligence, grace, beauty and talent shine and I hope she is not only nominated but wins the Oscar for this film. The supporting cast is incredible as well, Mila Kunis, I am just falling in love with her. Proving more and more that she's not just a pretty face but can take on a role that can be dangerous and makes it her own and makes it relatable to the audience. Vincent Cassel is becoming one of my favorite actors, he's so strong and passionate and clearly gave so much into this role as the seductive dance teacher who in a sense is his dancer's prince from Swan Lake.",2010
10,"I will not give away any spoilers so as not to possibly ruin the experience for anyone, but I can say that this movie left me shaking when it was over. What did I just see? I know I was caught up and went for the entire ride from the opening scene till the very end. The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again.",2010
1,"My family almost walked out. My grown daughter said, ""I'm going to remember this director's name and avoid his flicks. And as for Natalie ... it's going to take me awhile to forgive her.""",2011
1,"I watched this film on the basis of the rave reviews it had received. More fool me. It has an IMDb average rating of 8.1, let's hope I can bring that down a little. Really folks, it should be the other way round i.e. 1.8, and even that is being generous. The film tried to deal with artistic stress, mental illness and sexual awakening and did so in most one dimensional way I have experienced in a long time in a movie. I was unable to relate to or sympathize with to any of the characters, they were unrealistic and lacked any complicity. If this is classed by all as a good film, then god help the film industry. ",2012
6,"I really don't understand what so many reviewers saw in this movie. I don't want to overreact and say it is terrible, but there is nothing in it that inspires or makes one think. It is a well made film. The directing is good, the performance by Natalie Portman is very believable. However, the problem with the movie is that Nina - the main character is flat and uninteresting. Right from the beginning of the movie the viewer is lead to believe that Nina is good, but all I saw is a confused and obsessed individual. She does not love anyone, she has no friends, she does not care about anyone... The only bright spot is her dream to become a leading ballerina in a Swan Lake production, however the movie never really explains why this dream is important to her, and for this reason it is hard to see this dream as anything but another of Nina's obsessions. In short, I just didn't find anything in this movie worth watching. And while I can't say I regret watching it, I would not recommend it either.",2011
7,"It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.",2011
1,Ah! ,2011
1,"Yes. This movie is disgracefully awful. Sigh. I've just returned from the cinema and had to write here, because I read so many misleading reviews that referred to this movie as a ""masterpiece"". Perhaps a masterpiece of emptiness. It has nothing in it, no matter where you try to look from, no matter how many fingers will be shoved in unbecoming places. Such an amateur work is suitable for a 1st year student who still hasn't been cured yet of superficial story patterns. *Everything* in this movie, with no single exception, is screaming of banality. The characters, their characteristics, their actions, the turn of events. It's all one big yawn, following childish formulas so blindly. ",2011
