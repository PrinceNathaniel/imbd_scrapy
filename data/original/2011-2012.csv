9,"As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. ",2011
10,"Readers who come to this review later in the series must note that, at the time of this writing, I have only seen the inaugural episode. ",2011
10,Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.,2011
10,Seeing a review comparing this brilliant title to Lord of the Rings made me make an account here and post my very first review. ,2011
9,"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.",2014
10,"First of all, I am a huge fan of the books, and I find it exhilarating to see a show that is so close to what I made in my mind while reading it.",2011
10,This TV series is magnificent! I read a book and I must say that A Game Of Thrones is one of the best books I've read. So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better! ,2011
10,"This show is superb! While I may be bias as the book series is my favourite book series of all, I still think the show itself is fantastic! It sticks loyally to the books and doesn't ""dumb things down"" for a wider audience. If you are worried you won't gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It's the same experience, with a different medium!",2011
10,"Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire. For those fans who know and love the books, then you can't help but love the TV adaptation. It is difficult to translate books into movies or TV series, but HBO's GoT made it look easy. The characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that I was inside the books themselves. Although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.",2011
10,"Love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption All collides in mythical world of Westeros. George R. R. Martin's world is unlike any other fantasy world you have ever seen. The main conflict lies between two families: House of Stark and House of Lannister, but there are many more stores to be told",2011
9,"Damn you George R.R. Martin! Don't do movies, finish the damn next book ... oh wait ... he did! OK! Than let's look at the series...",2011
1,Season 1 to 4 = 10/10.,2017
10,"To start with, I read the books once only, got into it thanks to my friend(bless him) and when I learned that TV show is being made by HBO we all cheered, since we always said it is impossible to convert this epic story into a 2 and a half hour movie.",2011
1,"Heard a lot about this show with everyone saying how great it was so I decided to watch it to see if it was as good as I was told. I found the first episode a little boring and slow but figured it was setting up the characters, etc.",2015
1,It always felt like this show was sitting just below excellence. Feeling the need to take a cheeky giggle at a nipple or dick every so often to make the viewer pay attention.,2015
10,This review is not about why this show is so great (see my 10 ranking) but a response to the haters who's comments I can't fully comprehend.,2013
1,"Where Game of Thrones stumbles is it's (dis)ability to properly handle characters and a story at once. The creators of this show are apparently bound on showing needless scenes of naked woman belittling themselves in every episode. Nothing is right with that statement. Just because your show is on HBO doesn't mean nudity needs to appear whenever possible. See Silicon Valley, why can't all HBO shows handle nudity like that? Oh yeah, because Game of Thrones needs an audience. Strip the nudity and you have a worthless show that may be the most atrocious thing to ever exist. Perhaps you will all see come the final season, because eventually the writers have to stop daydreaming of women and actually make a television show.",2015
10,"It has begun! The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come. ",2011
1,"After seeing today in Game of Trones how father let her kid/daughter being burned alive, I realized that author of this serial, as well as HBO may need professional (medical) assistance. Actually, since the beginning, it is hard to find anything that would make anyone feeling good. Seems normal people are in this series only and exclusively heading to miserable ends (being brutally killed, beheaded, burned, skulls being crushed by bare hands to name a few - and any similarity with world around us is pure coincidence) while negative characters are in full swing!",2015
1,"First of all, this is only my opinion, you don't have to agree. But I find Game of Thrones to be the most pretentious, sadistic, boring and perverted show on earth. First off, its medieval setting is incredibly cliché. Why do all fantasy things seem to take place in what resembles medieval Europe? This has been WAY overdone in the genre. And then there's the cruelty in the show. I love horror films, I love crime thrillers, but in Game of Thrones the frequent violence is so nonchalant that it's like a sociopath created a television program or something! Of course the rise of nerd culture is likely what is making this bizarre show so popular. All it is though is violence, boring archaic dialogue and of course, sex constantly. Sex without love, basically S/M porn for TV. Some viewers probably get off on it. It's disgusting, like watching a snuff film broadcast into my house. I no longer watch the show and have no plans to continue wasting my time with it. People praise it for its ""political concepts"" and ""well-developed characters"" and yet the show follows every fantasy trope and its only edge is death and violent sex for shock value. The whole show seems to exist largely just so its creators can push boundaries by throwing in all kinds of psychotic garbage just to see if they can pull it off and get away with it all. I know the books were violent but never to this extent. Terrible show in my opinion and however the hell it got such a high rating is absolutely beyond me.",2017
10,"It's very premature to say much about the series after watching only the first episode, so I'll limit my opinion to the one and only episode that has been broadcasted so far.",2011
1,"Have to say that shortly after the start of season five I have become weary of so much sadistic violence over and over again and not anything good ever happening. The story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. It is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. Enough already. Apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and I just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye Game of Thrones.",2015
10,Season One,2012
5,"This show started out incredibly strong. It was at the forefront of glamorous TV. Never before had Hollywood level acting and visuals been applied to a long running TV series. This show broke the mold, and continued to do so for 5 seasons. Until the show surpassed the literature it was based on. Game of Thrones held no punches, it didn't care what the viewers opinion on a character was, the lines between good and evil were blurred, and because of this it was unique. This started to derail in season 6, when the show began to develop its on takes on story arcs of the books. It was instantly obvious the writing staff were toddlers compared to the father of the story. But it still held things together. Until season 7. The first scene that greets us was completely unnecessary and can only be labelled as fan service. Something the show had never done before, Frey was killed off solely to promote a positive response from fans. Within moments we are then introduced to Ed Sheeran, with a scene that could only have been placed to humanize the ""enemy"" however the family in question had never been classed as the enemy prior, before they were simply another side in the conflict. That scene destroyed the dynamic of the show and changed its message completely. Further enforced by the fact that suddenly everyone's picked a side. The show has changed from a power struggle to clichéd good vs evil. Dripping with the political beliefs of the shows writers, every second word that seems to be coming out of characters mouths screams ""girl power"" which is fine, but at least find an intelligent way to implement it, rather than slapping everyone in the face with it every time a strong female lead is shown. The pace of the show has also been lost, with it a lot of power the story held, everything seems rushed with season 7, each scene is being done as quickly as it can, detracting from the impact it would have had. The show has lost everything that made it unique.",2017
10,"Game of Thrones, the best TV show ever! But y'all know that already. ",2017
9,"Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: ""...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.""",2015
10,Brilliant.,2015
9,"I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. ",2012
10,"The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.",2014
10,This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?,2012
8,"To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature. ",2012
10,Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time. ,2013
9,"I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling ""disturbed"". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....",2013
10,"The creativity is the main problem, especially in modern culture product till 2000's. We always seen main concepts, same approaches and same faces on our TV's, and cinemas. Even trying something different and genius, has become very commonplace. But Black Mirror is totally different and witty. You need only five minute watching to understand this. Different point of view, different stories, different but natural talented faces... Some ideas in this artwork could be disturb you, but this makes it consummate. It questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have... At the end, you only feel the happiness of awareness. Thank you for showing me something different than usual, thank you for make me more aware.",2012
9,"After watching the first episode, I was shocked about the negative reviews it received. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't what I expected but that doesn't make it bad. It was very dark, and very shocking; Had me completely on the edge of my seat throughout. You will have to watch it with an open mind as it is somewhat distasteful and well... extremely far-fetched (Which is pretty absurd for a satire, but I digress.) I did thoroughly enjoy it however, it hit all the right notes.",2012
7,"A friend recommended this show a while ago and to pass the time in between new Twin Peaks episodes we decided to binge this series. The first season kept us hooked really well. Original writing, super sharp editing, decent acting and class. The next few episodes in season 2 were still good and exciting. A lot of nice atmosphere, which I love.",2017
5,"The first two seasons of this program were about as good as television can be. Genuinely amazing. Unfortunately, everything past that isn't half as good. Not sure what changed between then and now, but something definitely has.",2017
7,"It's like these guys with the cardboard sign ""The end is near"" or these christian fanatics with ""Homosexuality is a sin"". Most episodes are just exaggerating actual society phenomenons. Yes, technology is changing fast and with it our society and social behaviour. But most episodes feel like a sermon. Pretty exhausting after 3 seasons. 6 Stars, but because there are some decent episodes among the seasons, 7 stars.",2017
5,"I was very disappointed by Black Mirror Series 1 & 2, save for S1E3 - the only instalment NOT written by Charlie Brooker (instead penned by Jesse Armstrong of 'Peep Show' fame), 'The Entire History of You', which on its own is an excellent drama.",2014
9,"Season 1 of Britain's ""Black Mirror"" (2011) was absolutely terrific. (To be clear, this first ""season"" consists of only three episodes, although subsequent seasons have more.) This looks to be a truly superb dystopian science fiction anthology series — I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.",2017
3,"I don't know what too make of Black Mirror. I know I don't like it, but I don't know if it's because the show is bad, or if it's because it's tapping in to something that's going on in the world right now that I don't see, or can't relate too. It makes me feel kind of stupid. I've heard a lot of people praising the show. I keep hearing that it's satire, but I've watched the entire series and not one of the episode makes any sense too me, and I'm no stranger to weird science fiction. I'm a fan of J.G. Ballard, I read a lot of William S. Burroughs when I was a kid, I'm a huge fan of Rod Serling So I guess what I'm saying is that this is less of a review, and more of a message to anyone who feels the same way I do: you are not alone.",2015
1,"I've read lots of good reviews, so I gave it a shot.",2015
4,"Sorry Charlie Brooker, but this series seems as though written by an aging populace preaching resistance to change. The ideas portrayed are clear, but they only paint a one-sided perspective that's biased towards the negative, with scientific or moral dilemmas purposefully ignored or emitted to promote it, and doesn't hold up to further scrutiny. It is well executed visually, perfectly acted, shot and written, and episodes start from the right vantage point to yield maximum effect. It's with the message that I have the biggest contention; There have and always will be negative obstacles to any progress: Technology has revolutionised fraud and theft, provided new forms of bullying, sensationalism and public humiliation. But it has transformed the world enormously for the better, improving access to information, communication, commerce, increased globalisation and productivity. Such challenges breed discussion, promote awareness to decrease prevalence, and offer possible improvements to laws and regulations. As problems evolve with and because of technology, our ability to combat and prevent them evolves as well. Here are the issued I encountered for each episode (SPOLERS AHEAD): ",2014
5,"Charlie Booker is a good (maybe great) comedy writer. He's not good at dystopian fiction. A lot of good actors in these episodes and the series really swings for the fence, but it's a strikeout. The ideas are thin, the dialog is wooden and the concepts are pretty lightweight and at the same time, pretty repulsive. Sort of a ""Idiocracy"" feel to the series, with the current state of affairs brought to some sort of futuristic territories, but no humor and very little to recommend it. I watched the first one, the one about the return of the dead thru software, the one about the special Disney punishment village and the one about the ""American Idol""/Hunger Games kind of TV show, with the avatars and all that. None of them really any good, and a pity to see Mike Smiley and some of the characters from the Thick of It wasted in this. I spose they enjoyed the paycheck",2014
1,"Watched the first 2 episodes with my wife and I have to say this is the most awful thing I've seen in a long time, no real plot and the first episode should have been enough to drive me away but everyone I talked to said the show was good and I thought maybe the first ep just got off on the wrong foot but no the shows rubbish.",2014
1,"I watched the opening episode of this series in that faint hope that a series would come along that MAYBE had some really timeless qualities that the Twilight Zone had, namely, smart, innovative, fantasy, horror, science fiction. What I came across was an absolute waste of time. After watching the series opener ""National anthem"" I was horrified. Horrified that someone would conceive and execute such a vile, disgusting piece of television such as this. Instead of fantasy, charm, literacy, and magic, we get an absolutely disgusting piece of rubbish. Rod Serling is turning over in his grave after this garbage was likened to TZ by Netflix. Everyone involved in this should be embarrassed, but I doubt that's possible anymore in the world we live in. But I guess that was the point wasn't it? Please do yourself a favor and watch literally anything but this.",2014
8,"Charlie Brooker is a great satirist: funny and clever, and, although often crude, in 'Black Mirror' he certainly isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator (in spite of the fact that the first film is about the prime minister having sex with a pig!). Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart.",2011
8,"This ridiculously short series is brilliant. There are three episodes, each a bleak and dark story about how the modern, internet and technology filled world could plunge us into hell. The first, is one set in the present. What is so fantastic, is that it is something that could happen tomorrow. The fictional princess is kidnapped by an unknown person and a video ransom is posted anonymously on YouTube bizarrely saying that unless the (fictional) prime minister had sexual intercourse with a pig live broadcast on every British television channel in four days, she would be killed. The story is gripping, the actors are brilliant and realistic, and the episode is also fabulously directed, adding in little things such as over the course of the four days the prime minister's hair seems to thin out of stress of knowing what he must do. This episode certainly shows you just how terrible the internet could be if it gets into the wrong and powerful hands. ",2011
1,"I can't understand why this show has such a high rating. I've long come to not be able to trust IMDb review ratings. I noticed that most of the 8-9 star reviews are from outside of my home country of the U.S. Many things don't always translate across borders, so I can say those reviews are wrong or bad. ",2016
7,"Of course, it can be compared to Tim Allen's old show, but this is really fresh and Tim having to interact with girls instead of boys really puts him out of his element, and adds to the humor. Love Hector as the boss,(He was the best part of Pretty Woman). The girls are really starting to shine, especially the middle one, who is so clueless! I do agree with someone else, the youngest one is the most likable and best played. As far as Nancy Travis being weak, I disagree. She is nearly perfect as the sensible half of that marriage who is the calming influence. She has seen it all before and does not need to go over the top, that is Tim's job! (and still looks good in a pirate costume)",2011
10,I missed the premiere. I don't watch ABC that much and must have missed the promo. I came across it on Hulu and was tickled to see Tim Allen back in a family sitcom. I watched both episodes and have put it on my watch/DVR list. I really enjoyed the show. I realize that the first couple of episodes of any new production are spent trying to set the stage and help us get to know the characters. I look forward to seeing these beautiful girls challenge their parents as they deal with life experiences. Seeing Tim Allen in the role of granddad reminds me of my own father. So sweet!,2011
2,"Last season I rated it a 10. Replacing Kristin (oldest daughter) with a completely different personality was bad enough, but aging the kid 5 years and adding an older irritating guy as Kristin's baby-daddy is too much. The show went from fun to lame. The daughter's were perfect, too bad the staff couldn't get along. Keep the focus on Tim Allen and the show might recover. One more episode like season 2 episode 1, and I'm done. The premise is a family divided by the election. Really, I hear about this stuff all day, and I watch shows like this to get away from it. Let's try to avoid spending a sitcom episode talking about the details of two candidates platforms...that's what the news is for. Boring.",2012
10,"First off, I'm sick of the comparisons to Home Improvement. #1: It's an iconic television program that stands completely on its own. #2: People get older and move on to different things, its like someone in their 40's dwelling on how great their 20's were for the rest of their lives. Tim Allen really revives his career with this show. I wasn't a big fan of his movies, but this gave me a new outlook on the man. His transition from a father of three boys to a father of three girls is hilarious. His wife in the show, Nancy Travis, plays great part that I feel has been greatly overlooked. Alexandra Krosney is a fresh face that shows a lot of promise with her role as a young mother in the show. Kaitlyn Dever plays the baby of the family and pulls the role off perfectly. And I saved the best for last: Molly Ephraim instantly became one of the sexiest woman on TV. She could look sexy in a snowsuit. Your witnessing the birth of a huge star in the making when you watch this show. Give up your notion as Tim Allen, father of 3 boys on Home Improvement and you suddenly become hooked on this fantastic new comedy.",2011
1,I had to stop watching this show. This show grew to have a really disturbing political agenda constantly taking pot shots at progressivism while never really examining any of the issues very deeply.,2017
10,"Minimal vulgarity unlike most of the sitcoms. Current family situations done with humor and showing perspectives from all ages and different opinions. I like the way they keep everything current with what is going on in the world. We laugh and have a good time and wish we didn't have to wait a week for a new episode, so we tape and re-watch during the week. It is so good to laugh. Most sitcoms are so classless... really disappointed with a couple new ones I thought would be family shows. I have no idea why they think they are funny and I certainly wouldn't want my family to see them. This show is FUNNY and family friendly!",2015
10,"This show hasn't been on long, but episode after episode, it's getting exponentially better - they're really hitting their stride. The whole cast connects, even the seemingly air headed daughter delivers some substance. Each episode has something that makes you think, or just has my family in stitches. Sitcoms have evolved into vulgarity that somehow passes as humor, and while no stranger to colorful language or people, it shouldn't substitute for content. This show delivers without sinking to that level, but it's not without colorful topics, and even deals with topics rather than tries to laugh track over them. Really impressed by what they're delivering, including real laughs, for a sitcom. The cast is great, the daughters are not just foils for situation targets, but ladies who can and do act. The strength and dialogue from the youngest is truly refreshing. We love the show.",2011
2,"Last season I gave this show a 9. I liked it, I laughed, I picked up on the subtle politics...now, you can only see the politics shoved up your a... Plus, I can not stand the ""new daughter"" and her baby daddy. Enough is enough with them! Seriously, the original Kristen rocked, no idea why she isn't there anymore, but it's too bad she's gone. So to put this into review terms. Show was great last season, this season they lost everything that was good about the show. Way too political for a sitcom and can't stand the newest actors. Don't believe me...just watch the first season then the second and you will see!!! So since I need more lines to make this a real review, I'll tell you a bit more. Tim Allen is funny, he really is. He did great last year. I don't mind politics in my sitcoms, just don't shove it down my throat!!",2013
1,"Season one was an easy 8 or 9. I loved the show. Let me say right now I wasn't a big fan of the actress who played Kristen, nor was I a fan of the character. My main issue was how she 'talked through her nose', as the phrase goes. I've seen ventriloquists move their lips more than her. As for the character, she seemed to have a permanent case of PMS as a result of her own bad life choices. Bottom line, if they wanted to change the character, they could have had her move or something. On to season two.",2012
2,"I have been a fan of Tim Allen for years. I could not wait to see his new show last year and I was not let down. The cast worked well together and my only complaint was there was not more of the grandchild. Again I could not wait for this season to start. I enjoy a good sitcom to just get away from all that is going on. I was surprised to find that a large majority of the cast was changed and not for the better. The show changed the oldest daughter and to me she was the glue of the show, then they aged the grandson and brought in an actor to play his dad that is very annoying. The Season 2 first show was on the election, this is a good way to turn off half the population. Do the writers not live in this country? I was so upset in the quality of the show and how poorly the cast worked together I almost turned it off. I decided to give it one more episode. Just watched Season 2 Episode 2, it was just as bad, the show just lost one more viewer. We deleted the show from our DVR. This is a great example of how you can ruin what was a very good show.",2012
10,"Canceling the show is a big mistake on ABCs part. One show...one conservative show out of your nightly repertoire would have you running for you safe space hoping to find someone with a safety pin! Tim Allen does a great job as usual, and brings levity to a house full of girls! You will be misses!",2017
3,"I don't know how so-called ""professional"" writers can believe that changing the formula of this show into polarizing political crap was a good move. After week after week of hammering away with annoying political topics in the episodes to start this second season, I'm done watching. I have taken it off my DVR and I sure won't be recommending this show to anyone. This is the quickest killing off of a once-likable show that I can remember seeing. The actress change for the oldest daughter is also disrupting, but not a big deal to me. And the useless addition of a grandson is usually the sign of a shark-jumping moment in shows that have run out of story lines. That is a bad sign in only their second season. I wouldn't bet on a third, except, oh yeah, Tim Allen is a favorite Disney actor; and ABC is owned by Disney.",2013
10,"There is a tendency to compare this show with Home Improvement and that is natural since it is part of Mr. Allen's resume. Home Improvement was brilliant and it was first, but this show can stand on it's own. (no pun intended). The writing is first class and the performance of same is also first class. Tim is at his usual best and all the other cast members are right on. Timing is first class, Hector is a great choice and they are lucky to have him. I never realized how he could fit in and make a show even better. The new wife isn't Jill, but so what, and the shift from boys to girls is even better. As far as a revival of his career goes, Tim Allen owes no one an explanation. The guy is funny . . . and carries off family chores very well . . . no need to revive a career that is still doing very well. He hasn't lost a beat and this show is even better than Tool Time.",2012
4,"First season, loved it. Three sisters and their mother vs rugged Outdoor Man.",2012
1,"I am sad that they ruined such a good show. My husband and I don't agree on a lot of sitcoms but this was one we both liked. The new Kristen is horrible. We are taking it off our DVR. We just couldn't believe how awful this episode was. She seems to old to be his daughter. Also, why age the kid? I don't care for the new guy playing her baby's dad but am not bothered by him either. He wasn't a big character and it would be good if he stayed that way. I could live with the older kid but the new Kristen is going to get the show canceled. She talked to him like a wife not a daughter. I hope the producers listen to the fans and get the old Kristen back and put the show back the way it was. Then I can put it back on our DVR.",2012

3,"At the end of last season I would have rated this show 8 out of 10. Apparently, someone stepped on someone else's toes, and those toes belonged to someone very sensitive, or egotistical, or moronic. They had the oldest sister replaced. I don't think any of the cast members are replaceable, but especially her. The chemistry is gone. What's worse is they replaced her with a mind numbingly boring and annoying actress, who is also on the bad side of ugly. Her face looks like a Pufferfish. My girlfriend and I aren't supermodels (maybe when I was younger:) But neither are we actors. Don't get me wrong, I don't think you have to be beautiful to be an actor, but if you're not, at least have talent. If you're lacking looks and talent, why bother watching, I can see that at family reunions. I predict this is the shows last season. If not, maybe I'll tryout for Tim Allen's character next season.",2012
1,"My wife and I loved this sitcom the first year. But now they've ruined it. We gave it a 10 out of 10 the first season, but now only a 1 out of 10. The new daughter and baby-daddy are annoying and very unlikeable. Now every episode is about some kind of ""pc"" issue that is absolutely irritating and nauseating. We watch sitcoms to be entertained, not to be preached to by a group of Hollywood elites who are out of touch with the real world. The latest episode on bullying and gay lesbian propaganda was just more of the same. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL WRITERS, OLDEST DAUGHTER AND UNBIASED, SPOT-ON SUBJECTS THAT WERE FUN AND INTERESTING!!!",2013
5,"As many have noted it's two different shows; the first season and the second. They changed the casting and that was bad. And every ep in s2 is a faked up Fox vs MSNBC political diatribe. But the worst aspect of the second season is it's turned into sitcom cliché. Man stoooopid woman genius. Man no walk without killing self woman talk fast always save day. Oooog. But worst of all is 'Brian'. Brian needs to be written out of the show. His character is the most annoying twit in history. Get rid of him. They need to go back to focusing on the workplace. That part of the show worked and it was, after all kind of the point of the show.",2014
1,"Watched a few episodes with a friend from college and found it absolutely inane, The show is unfunny and relies almost entirely on jokes about stereotypes of gender and sexuality. It's formulaic at best, and seems like a way for an insecure white heterosexual man to assert all of those features of himself because he feels threatened by the world around him. Painful to watch, boring, pointless drivel. Don't waste your time.",2017
10,"I'm hoping all the people who gave the show bad reviews once they switched Kristen have changed their minds. The first season was the worst in my opinion because of her. She resembled Mandy too much and didn't have a stand out personality which is what makes the show so funny. Kristen and Ryan are the liberal/hippies contradicting everything Mike stands for, Mandy is adorably air headed along with Kyle, and Eve is Mike Jr. I'm pretty opposite to Mike's political views but the way he presents them always makes me laugh. I also enjoy all the subtle references to Home Improvement. The Santa Claus, and Toy Story that are made.",2016

Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on.

Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.",2011

2,"This movie was so low on my expectations, and it did not disappoint. From the last few movies of Harry Potter that have come out, being an avid reader of the books, I've absolutely loathed the way they've been commercialized for the box office, ignoring a lot of the story that made the story so very emotional. Yes, when I say that, I mean FOR the box office. Yates probably knew he had messed up the series and thought he might as well earn a few bucks and make this an utter fiasco instead of using its plot to live up to the potential it had for an Oscar.",2011
1,"If I was to think of this and part 1 as one long movie, it'd be a 7/10. However it's not and part 2 was a shadow of the first. A real 'hollow' film that seemed rushed and had no great emotion or character depth which, to me, is what the final film should consist of the most. ",2011

With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!",2011
9,I saw this at a preview screening in London.,2011
2,"This final Harry Potter movie might be one of the worst films in years. But only if you've read the books. If you didn't read the books, it's nice and entertaining. The acting is quite good and the special effects are amazing. If you did read the books, it's absolutely dreadful. ",2011
1,"Deathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of it was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director and scriptwriter for the source matériel. The book had a rather good plot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to include any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that had nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other parts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and simply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does anyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and how many Harry had, if indeed he had any?",2011
6,"I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.",2011

10,Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10,2011
10,"This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",2011

After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end.

10,"I really feel confused. There seems to be an overwhelming sense of animosity toward this show.In a world where HOT IN CLEVELAND is a hit, it makes me sad that so many people don't seem to appreciate the nuance and detail that have gone into this show. There are some reviews here that don't even make much sense.They're just plain angry. (One review actually criticized the hair color of one of the actors!) I say, relax people. If you don't find it to your liking don't watch. But for those of us that do, (it's already a hit in the UK as well as on SHOWTIME) it is a subtle and sophisticated pleasure that doesn't pander to it's audience. This show is about a married couple and their relationship. It's set in the world of television but the TV aspect is secondary. I hadn't seen the two British leads before but I totally love their chemistry. It feels much more honest than most TV relationships. Both actors are subtle and complicated and I can totally buy the fact that they're married. I thought the first episode did exactly what it had to do which is introduce a whole lot of characters plus set up this couple's journey. As for not being funny, I am at a complete loss. John Pankow established ""Merc Lapides"" in twenty seconds. How could you not laugh at his references to his bigoted New Jersey grandmother, his alcohol addiction, his cancer? And ""Carol Rance"", the network exec, made me laugh at just about everything she said. Ditto the head of comedy who with just a few grimaces and groans created a hysterical and memorable character. I feel that this is not a show for the masses. It was clearly never meant to be. It's a small gem of a show that respects it's audience and has it's own very unique voice. Thank You SHOWTIME for presenting it.",2011
8,"I don't understand why this show hasn't generated more buzz! It's extremely well-written, the cast is terrific, and, perhaps most importantly, the show is FUNNY! I didn't have much respect for Matt LeBlanc's acting abilities prior to this show, but he is surprisingly excellent here! Granted, he is supposed to be playing ""himself"", but don't let that fool you. He's playing a character, and he does it well. It's just like any other acting job, except you happen to have a character with your same name. The supporting cast is equally terrific; great collection of characters (and, if you live in Los Angeles, as I do, you've likely met many of these same types of people!) I'm glad the show will be filming a second season, and I can only hope the audience grows. Seriously, one of the best-written comedies on TV right now!",2011
9,"I watched the first episode of Episodes and was not knocked out but saw that it had some potential. Matt Le Blanc really makes this show with a satirical take on himself and ""stars"" generally. I am now on the fourth episode and it has just gotten better and better. Most sitcoms are like this - they rarely hit their stride right out of the traps - though Frasier and Friends manage to buck that trend. I have never been a fan of Tamsin Greig or Stephen Mangan but I am beginning to appreciate their talents in this. Episodes is a great concept and is well written and performed. It benefits from having no laugh track or studio audience. Lots of reviewers here have written this off after the pilot episode but it is their loss - I really like this show and hope it works in the US as well as the UK. Added 22/02/11 Just watched the final episode of series 1 and I have grown to love this series-I just hope they recommission it. Matt Le Blanc should be lauded for the kind of bravery in acting that US stars usually forgo. He was terrific in this. Almost the end of December 2012 and I have just gotten around to watching series 2 in it's entirety in one afternoon! Series 1 was good but this is even better - the situation did not seem like a second series was on but how wrong I was. Matt warmed to his portrayal of himself and Tamsin and Stephen were terrific in it. I look forward to series 3.",2011
9,"This show is very clever doing what it does. The only reason some people don't like it is because their sense of humor is skewed. I never expected the humor to be like friends because of Matt or David Crane. I expected the same commitment from Matt though. He pours his self in the character, since he is playing an extravagant fictional version of himself and creates excellent scenes between the two British writers. Sure it is dark and very hard to get into in the first episode, but after episode 2 I was sold. Episode 3 was even better as there was more Matt to go around!! His interactions with Beverly, their sniping at each other and fighting felt genuine and was extremely funny! Give the show a chance and try to expand your comical vocabulary!",2011
8,"I don't know what the other reviewer was thinking, it's the perfect blend of American and British comedy that the Office couldn't achieve - they have British people doing British humour. And yes, it is only the first two episodes but it has shown great promise. I think it is a perfect mix of British and American humour because they don't mix them together to form some weird half-breed, but they separate them and have them interact as two different entities. Matt LeBlanc is hilarious, and they way he pokes fun at Joey is something we haven't seen since Julia Roberts in Oceans 13. ",2011
9,"After watching the first 3 shows, I'm impressed, will be a great show if this level of writing can be sustained. ""Episodes"" is a cross between ""Entourage"" (minus the glorification of wealth and conspicuous consumption), ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" (minus bad acting), and ""Extras"" (minus cameos, and bits that sucked of which there were many). ",2011
8,"While the first episode wasn't the greatest, it set up the story of the show and the second episode was great from start to finish. The humour is dry and is a mix of British and US humour, but it's definitely heavier with the British humour. The head of comedy was brilliant. The head of comedy is one of those blonde bimbo's you see on TV that just say ""that's so funny"" instead of actually laughing.",2011
10,"One night, out of curiosity for what the cast FRIENDS was up to now, I visited the FRIENDS IMDb page and found, to my surprise, that Matt LeBlanc was back in showbiz. It was a kind of treat for me, and seeing that David Crane was involved, was the cherry on top. With a lot of enthusiasm I began to watch the show, but with each passing minute my enthusiasm kept dropping and I thought to myself this will be another ""Joey"". The plot seemed it wasn't that well thought out and I just couldn't get myself to connect with any of the ""American"" characters. The only saving grace were Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig who, I thought, were fantastic.Their acting was flawless and I could clearly see the chemistry between them. They were the only ""funny"" characters on the show and I just couldn't see the show going on beyond it's first season. I had given up hope and dint plan on following the show any further than the first episode. As the week passed I found myself being curious again and told myself ""This is just the first episode. Maybe I should give the show one more chance"", and you know what? I am glad I did. The second episode was surprisingly better than the first. Where the first episode just managed to get a few chuckles out of me, the second one had me laughing out loud. The acting of all the involved characters had become more polished, the dialogues were actually funny, and most of all, LeBlanc did not disappoint, not one bit! He was charming, likable, and FUNNY! LeBlanc, Mangan and Grieg, together, were a breath of fresh air. They have great chemistry with one another and they give a superb performance on-screen. I am defiantly going to follow the show from now on and I would like to encourage others, who were disappointed by the pilot/first episode, to give the show another try. It holds A lot of promise.",2011

8,"The first two episodes are quite funny as it introduces the characters and get the story going but from then on it had me laughing out loud at the mix ox of clever and witty humour. The three main characters ""Matt LeBlanc"", ""Stephen Mangan"" and ""Tamsin Greig"" bounce off each other really well and bring the characters/plot alive and vibrant. Unfortuently there are only seven episodes so far but there will be a new second season nine episodes in length which I'm sure will be full of the same quick witted jokes that has become frequent in the new comedy. I hope if you read this you will watch and enjoy it. This is a must see 10/10",2012
7,"I was not sure what sort of comedy this was going to be. I have only just seen the first episode and as it turns out it is a little dark, uncomfortable, subtle, at times quirky and pokes fun. I found it amusing, with moments that made me laugh out loud. Some of the characters (particularly the 'Head of Comedy') are well cast and very funny.",2011

There's some shock value humour, some more subtle laughs and some hilarious awkward moments; everything you need for a good start to a series, I think it shows promise and I'll definitely be tuning in next week.",2011
10,"Absolutely outstanding program! Matt Leblanc amazing, it is correct that the first episode is hard to get into, but get passed that and every episode there after is progressively better and better. A MUST WATCH Roll on last episode of season 3 and hope season 4 doesn't take to long to air. Very exciting to have this to look forward too. I am a huge Friends fan and know of a lot of other people that are and they all say that this program grips them and excites them and agree with me that this is one of the best programs to air since ",2014

10,"Love love LOVE this show!! This is the funniest thing I have seen on TV since 30 Rock. It's got this small time indie comedy feeling to it, but it's a big production, so love the production quality as well. Matt LeBlanc is awesome, God he is sooo funny! I liked Joey too, but this is much much funnier. There is a depth to each character. The storyline is nice, its very different from what is on TV nowadays. The show has a great re-run value. The story moves pretty fast. I guess the main theme of the show is Matt LeBlanc's character and stuff happening to it, which is great. Is Matt really like this? He seems awesome. The Hollywood network types r perfectly done. The show has a very different look from other showsits more bright I think, or better quality maybe. But its much nicer to watch. I love all the characters. The writer couple Beverly and Sean are nice, I love Beverly. The writing is funny, actors r great, Matt LeBlanc steals the show. I love Carol's character. And the old Hollywood mystery with Mornings character, tats funny. In all, wonderful show, hope they finish many seasons, I will definitely watch.",2013

10,"I turned 40 this year. My wife and I have been great fans of the show Friends, and we were so disappointed with Joey - even though we got what they were trying to do with it, the show simply felt ""off"" to us. So you'll understand that with our background and being fans of Matt's work in Friends, we were looking forward to view EPISODES for the first time, but we were also fearful it would be a let-down.",2012
9,"I am a big fan of Friends like a lot of people around the world. I always thought that Friends was a big hit everywhere because it was genuine. After ten season of watching those people, I felt like I was actually friends with them too -and I know a lot of people felt that way as well-. When the show ended, of course I looked out for everything that those 6 people did including the Cougar Town which I also liked and Mr. Sunshine. Even though those shows were good, ""Episodes"" is something different and something really really good. First of all, we should accept the fact that we can not watch Matt LeBlanc and not think about Joey or Friends (like any other character of friends in any other show). The difference of Episodes is that this show knows this fact, acknowledges it, uses it but also not overwhelms you with it. Also, it makes its difference by using the widely different British humor quite wisely (in Sean and Beverly characters) and mixing it with American flavor (the rest of the characters starting with LeBlanc). Besides its great humors, the show is giving us a wonderful insight of Hollywood and TV networks. Its self criticism of the ""industry"" makes us feel like listening to an honest, funny and a very clever person. The only complaint about this show is it lasts only 7-9 episodes in one season! I must say that having 7-9 episodes is too British for a show that is also very American. Other than that hats off to David Crane and Jeff Klarik and I highly recommend this show to everyone who needs to watch something good and different.",2012
10,"I *looooove* this show! It will unfortunately crash and burn because it is far too smart for most television viewers. How can it be funny when there is no studio audience to let me know when to laugh? :p Matt Leblanc should win an Emmy. He is the perfect smarmy narcissist (and hopefully bears no resemblance to himself.) The British couple are pitch-perfect. Writing is dead on, capturing all the nuance of the clash of British and American culture. I was working in LA for a while and as a Canadian, I can relate to the subtle (and not so subtle) differences between cultures. I have always loved British comedy for its subtle, sniper-style humour. This show marries that style with the more traditional broad American comedy - while neither diluting nor corrupting either. Can't wait for the next episode!",2011
10,"This has to be the best work Matt has affiliated himself with. Tamsin and the crew - superb - witty, clever, exceptional. Merc is atypical Hollywood schmooze personified! The strength of the show lies within the complex relationships - it also gives an insight into the real Matt Le Blanc - celebrity persona picked apart layer by layer to reveal he actually has an excellent grasp of the inner workings of Hollywood and shows glimpses of intelligent forethought and observations.",2012
10,"I've been watching sitcoms since, well, the fifties. And it really was a pleasure to watch something that didn't include farting as the main joke. There have been some great sitcoms: From the Honeymooners to All in the Family to Seinfeld. (sure I skipped a few) I'll rank this one among great sitcoms. It gets better and better with each episode. I was leery at first because I didn't really think much of Matt LeBlanc and I never really watched Friends and Joey stunk to high heaven. But he's actually very very good and a great part of that cast. Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Grieg I had seen before in ""Green Wing"" and I loved her role in Friday Night Dinner (You can see FND on You Tube. Netflix recently pulled Green Wing) I'd never seen the one who plays Carol but she's very good too. And the Merc Lapidus actor? Great. Timing is everything in comedy as well the writing and both are extremely well done. I don't really laugh much when watching a sitcom but this show genuinely has made me laugh out loud. No, I'm not an idiot.",2014
9,This is a really great show. It has bin all while that there was such a good show. It is so well written en the actors are all perfect for there rolls. It is so funny. I'm glad that there is gonna be a second season!! Really everybody watch this show. A good combination between English and American humor. I think if you like friends and the office. You will enjoy this series. I hope you like the show as much as i do. It is a good combination for simple humor and heavy humor. I think this show is so great because there is all lot of English humor in this show. The main character's are well played by the actors. Especially the two British actors. And Matt Leblanc also plays a steady roll.,2012
8,When I first saw previews for this on Showtime I thought it'd be terrible. I never thought Matt LeBlanc was a good actor and the thought of someone playing themselves is always a little stupid. But he's been very good and convincing as what I'd hope is an extreme version of himself.,2011

10,"""Person of Interest"" is the brainchild of Jonathan Nolan, the brother of director Chirstopher Nolan. Jonathan wrote the screenplays for Christopher's movies ""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestinge"", ""The Dark Knight"", as well as the upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises"", and ""Man of Steel"", which Christopher is producing. But, back to ""Person of Interest"". John Reese (Jim Cavezil. OK, I did NOT spell that right. It's the guy that played Jesus in ""Passion of the Christ"", is a former government agent who experienced a tragic event in his past, and wants to conceal it from everyone. He is essentially homeless, but possesses some pretty impressive fighting skills. It's these fighting skills that make him noticed by two people: the first is an NYPD agent, Carter (Taraji P. Henson), who doens't really know who Reese is, and Reese doens't want to reveal anything to her. The other person is Finch (Michael Emmerson), a mysterious millionaire who was hired by the government after 9/11 to create a Big Brother like machine that would help save innocent people from being killed. But, eventually, the Machine began to take on a mind of it's own, and Finch took matters into his own hands, helping these people on his own, without the help of the government. It's this that leads him to Reese. He sees in Reese someone like him, a person who can't get over past tragedies, and it's those tragedies that are holding him back from being successful. Finch and Reese become somewhat of business partners, with Finch using Reese to find ways to save innocent people. But, sometimes, these people are not as innocent as they seem.",2011

9,"So I don't have too many TV shows that I would say that I'm hooked on. I had LOST while it was on the air, and that was enough for me. Since that show ended, I've had a couple of shows that I've paid attention to, but none have ever really replicated the intensity and addictiveness of LOST. In fact, in those years, there have been shows that I have thought might have the ""potential,"" but they all flopped and didn't get renewed. For this reason, I have a hard time when someone tells me a show is ""the new LOST"" or something to that effect. ",2011
9,"It is hard to do something fresh or different in this genre. I've found, usually, it is either writing or chemistry that produces success. This show has both (at least in the pilot). Cav can carry the weight of holding one's attention for an hour. He's proved that in spades.",2011
10,"sad to b over but its a best series i ever saw great acting solid plot just want more n more hope they make comeback, m glad i watch it mind blowing full of twists n turns wonderful best parts starts from season 3 just takes to another level with a fitting ending in season 5 i just hoped it to continue till season 10 i miss this great series badly HOPE IT MAKES A COMEBACK",2017
10,"Story >> At the first season, the plot may seem repetitive. But mind you, it will take you to a series of roller coaster ride as it goes on. So, just give it time and being open-minded is a necessity. Some people may think of it as unrealistic, but if you look at it closely, it isn't at all. Everything about the show is portrayed realistically well and, without a doubt, a work of geniuses. Well, aside from the AI which isn't that unlikely to happen in the near future. I'm utterly amazed of how perceptive this show is and even the episode titles are meticulously decided, choosing computer terms and all. And what's great about this show is that it has a little bit of everything despite the crime/action genre. One moment, it gets serious and mysterious and then, put you on edge over the tight action. The next thing you know, you're definitely moved by the cheesy yet adorable moments. And then suddenly, you'll find yourself crying for the characters. And every now and then, you'll find yourself laughing because of the crazy sarcastic yet geeky punchlines.",2016
10,"It started well. The concept was good. Acting was good. Characters and stories were good. And it would have stayed that way for five straight years and no one would have complained. But the creators never stopped thinking. New characters were perfect. New twists were perfect. The old characters grew. Chapman state vintage. The point here is, the series should have gone with Reese and Finch saving people every episode and still would have been good. The creators took it to another level. After second season they stretched their boundaries and boy they did good. Everything changes, and like it or not, everything still goes on. Having watched four seasons, I really appreciate the way this show tries to get better and give something new. Keep going.",2016
10,"This show is truly genius. It starts out as an intriguing procedural with the premise that a very intelligent man creates an all seeing AI and sells it to the government for protection against terrorist attacks. The ""Machine"" as they call it, separates the threats into two categories: relevant to national security, and irrelevant to national security. Horrified that the government couldn't care less about the irrelevant threats (everyday crime and murder) Harold Finch enlists John Reese to save peoples lives, but with a twist. The machine has been coded to only give a social security number in order to protect the public's privacy. Now Finch and Reese must save lives with limited information and keep the streets of NYC safe. ",2016
9,"I love the lead actors, Jim Cazaviel and Michael Emerson, who play Reese and Finch in this post-9-11 world. Finch finds and bails Reese out of jail and hires him to help protect Jessica Hanson in the first episode from being killed or killing. Unlike other crime dramas on the air, they don't play by the book which is refreshing. I hope they add more female characters in to help explain Finch and Reese's backgrounds. I love Michael Emerson ever since his performance in Lost. As Finch, he's totally believable as the rich billionaire who wants to make a difference and stop further horrible attacks such as murder. We don't know why he does it except how he felt after the September 11 attacks in New York City but he realized how much or how little money and power. Finch developed a system to help track persons of interest before something terrible happens to him. Reese is perfect as a former government agent disillusioned by the agency and the world to help him foil further plots. I keep looking for the future for this show and hope it lasts a season.",2011
10,Possible spoiler - A friend told me about this 7mths ago and said it was fab so I decided to have a look.So glad I did as since that 1st viewing I have watched every single episode (so far)and each leaves me wanting more.,2014

10,"I'm an old guy, seen a lot of TV series. This is the best I've come across, excellent actors, excellent writers, excellent camera work, excellent sound, etc.",2016
10,"I'm not a fan of TV shows. They tend to be repetitive, boring, they tend to get worse with every season (I'm looking at you, Game of Thrones) until the pitiful end. Nothing like that with Person of Interest. ",2016
10,"I'm not giving a synopsis of the show because that is not a review. What I am going to say is this show is dynamic with a very intriguing story. The casting is superb with a variety of races and ethnic groups all playing a part in the show. Not only that but women with parts that are equal to the men. Even when some have left the show they come back here and there in flash backs in time. Root is a female character played by Amy Acker. She does an outstanding job in the part. She is waif-like with a high pitched voice to make her deceptive because in all actuality she is smart and lethal. I like the fact she communicates with one of the AIs directly at the whim of the program. This is one of the best crime dramas I have seen on a network in a very long time. I know there are others but they have become basically redundant at this point. Each one is entirely different from this series. Person of Interest is unique and covers all levels of law enforcement as well as the underworld. There are many characters that aren't in every episode but they are reoccurring and played by outstanding actors. The writing is excellent and they have made the characters they have created very appealing. I find myself rooting for them. If this series were to be canceled it would be one of the biggest mistakes a network could make. It is unique in its story line, so much so I'm addicted to it and I didn't start watching it on the network but in Netflix and was astonished at the quality of the show. As far as I'm concerned, the series is genius and better than any other now airing on any network of its type.",2016
9,"I'll open my review of the series by stating that this is my first review of a television show on this site. I'll also admit that I've read many reviews on here about the show, and I'm surprised that absolutely none of the reviews mentions the 11th character, the music. So, yes, my review will contain my thoughts on how the music was used on and helped shape, this show. ",2017
10,I love this series. It's a must watch in my opinion. Smart and doesn't assume the audience is stupid. But at the same time explains enough so that anyone can 'get' what is going on. There are issues - skilled protagonists when in previous employment could kill 5 people with 5 bullets but in later series when the number of combatants increase... both lose the ability to hit anyone with dozens (or hundreds) of bullets (at times) - all seems contrived to be hail of bullet battles when such people wouldn't do it like that (imo).,2017
10,"You are being watched.Wait don't get stressed people after hearing that sentence and don't get paranoid.Don't look around or keep your lights turned on through out the night.I was just talking about the show which centers mainly around the concept of artificial intelligence that was created to monitor every conversation,read every messages in the multimedia and also to know about peoples browser history.Wait you should be paranoid and mainly delete your browser history(As should i,just a moment).Okay since that's out of the way let's get into the world of an artificial intelligence that was created to find bad guys from the general public and how two people used it to stop crime.Yes you heard me right to stop crimes.",2017
10,"It almost one year after its final I still miss POI, almost everyday searching the news-feeds for any chance of revival, voting in Netflix and change.org sites, but still nothing. I want it back with all characters, not just the survivors of its heartbreaking final. ",2017
10,"One thing I hate in it: it will be ended this year! The 'Person of Interest' is the best series I have ever seen. The full situation, the story the characters, the dramaturgy, even the Machine's eyes or Samaritan's eyes (the display of their cameras) are very realistic believable. OK, Reese and Shaw are a little bit too perfect killers (but not invulnerable – that's OK). And Root! – Root is a very nice autodidact one man CIA (nice on the second power :-) ), I laugh a lot of her sophisticated jokes! And Harold's character is fantastic! Smart, polite, intelligent, peaceable real genius – but when it necessary his mind is a blade which solves the issues like that of Alexander the Great's on the Gordian knot. He is a dream! And not to forget the main actresses, and actors, they are excellent, and were very good choices. Congratulations all of them! Hats off in front of them! (As the Hungarian says.) This series were getting better year by year and more exciting. So in the end I can say the same: One thing I hate in it: it will be ended this year. :-(",2016
10,"This is a GREAT show!...Cleverly written and the actors are wonderful! Our Family LOVES this show! The way the writers mix the Grimm's Fairy tales into present day plots are very interesting. Seeing Portland,Oregon in all it's beauty and lushness is quite breathtaking. We especially liked the refrigerator repair man on ""Danse Macabre"". Of course Monroe is always fun. Kate Burton was a wonderful surprise on the pilot episode. David Giuntoli and Danny Bruno are AWESOME!!!!!!! The special effects are amazing. We like the autopsy scenes too even though pretty gruesome! It's way cool! I hope that NBC does the smart thing and keeps this one going... It's certainly a HIT in our house. Sincerely, Nancy Di Leo and Family.",2011
10,"I was skeptical when I heard of a cop procedural meets fairy tale show. We've already got something pretty close to that (or we used to) with Supernatural. But while in the folktales course I took this year, my TA suggested it and gave it good reviews so I figured why not. And I'm so glad I did. ",2011
8,"Grimm largely follows the line of most crime dramas, but with the fun twist that the bad guys are characters from fairy tales and folk-stories. The main character is reasonably interesting, his partners (one his human police partner & a new friend that is basically a big bad wolf) are mildly amusing, and the crimes are intriguing. Only time will tell if it can stay interesting, but for now I am extremely optimistic. It is a show that can appeal to fantasy fans (like me) and crime drama fans (like my husband).",2011
10,"This show has appeal and intrigue, which is why I really like it. In many ways, it is believable, or makes a solid attempt to be (although elements of fantasy might not be a match for some peoples limited reality). It awakens your imagination and pushes it a little further. It is exciting and the action is constant in its delivery, which keeps your interest. You don't always know what to expect, while at other times, you may try to solve the mystery and prove yourself right, or wrong.",2012
9,"Grimm is a really good show where you basically learn that Grimm's fairy tales was not really fairy tales after all. Nick, the main character, is coming to terms with this whole new world and the fact that he is a Grimm. I like that this is the type of show that you can watch with friends, kids, and even your grandmother because it's good for all audiences. I love supernatural type shows and this is a really good one. The only real complaint that I have about the show is the acting, mostly, Juliette's acting. She is just not a real character that you learn to grow and love like most shows typically do. When things happen to her it's pretty much just like whatever, he's better off because her acting or lack there of can get pretty annoying. Anyway, really good show and do recommend.",2012
9,I'm glad that the networks are finally competing for an audience again. A lot of TV series keep rehashing the same old stories and people are turning away to Cable TV for original shows.,2011
6,Why do the writers turn every show that I love into a soap opera? Is this type of writing really that popular? I cannot imagine how this writing is liked. I must be different from other viewers.,2014
10,"I'm not the best at giving reviews, I am only sixteen, so bare with me. I found the pilot interesting, to say the least. It did a wonderful job at introducing the main characters and the main gist to how every episode will go. I think this idea the creators came up with has a lot of potential. I enjoyed watching this and hope it will be continued on for more than just that, a pilot. I can seriously picture myself sitting down every night to watch this. I have yet to find a series that I can follow with for more than a few episodes, and I do believe I can sit down and watch this through out the entire series. I'd definitely give it a shot it I were you; depending on if you like shows that have the main character chasing after monsters that were written about in old folklore just to save someone they don't even know. I can't wait for more episodes. Definitely worth ten stars!",2011
10,"I really don't understand the 7.5??? Why is it bad? This show is gutsy.....not many shows deal with, or show the kind of things this show does...I watched it in Sweden,(where I live...yeahhhh)all four episodes, and didn't realize until the 2nd episode that it was run on NBC.I really thought it was a cable produced show.......not only does it deliver sweet looking co-ed dismemberment after attacking werewolf basically eats her to death,but also shows pedophiliac monsters,action and arm ripping jokes....I mean yeah, sure, somethings are off..... this city is crawling with blödbaden seemingly running wild,yet every single case is assigned to the same detective(are there any more detectives?and why is that specific Chinese cop always fetching what they need?I'm guessing they're his superior but he dresses like the rest of the cops.....,and the model looking vet girlfriend who makes me wonder if the next episode is the one where she dumps him.....other than that........ It's funny,scary,creepy,interesting,and not very politically correct,which is great....I don't know maybe I'm exaggerating ,but I can't wait to see what new Blödbaden they come up with...cool show...even more so after a smoke....",2011
1,"I seriously fail to understand how this show manages to appeal to anyone. The plot is a mind-numbing mish-mash of other successes, using the painfully ever-present 'cop show' format, but squeezing in a Buffy- style fantasy element and a Harry Potter-style lead. The main character is your average way-too-young-and-pretty TV Detective, living a seemingly normal life, until his sickly aunt shows up and informs him he's inherited the role of a Monster-Slayer (cough-Buffy-Cough) and that his parents, who he thought died in a car-crash, were actually killed by 'Him', a mysterious figure who's also now hunting the main character down. (cough-harrypotter-cough)",2012
1,"Where should I even begin, Juliettes character was so annoying that I quit watching it mid season 2. She adds nothing to plot and is only in movie to serve as a love interests. She is stubborn, acts like a know it all but knows nothing. She asks for explanation and when an effort is made to provide her with one, she starts acting all knowing. I mean what does she expect. The one playing her role even makes it worse with her bad acting and bad voice. Oh God if that is her character in real life, I would stay away from her, because she is boring and annoying.",2014
2,"When the previews first aired for Grimm on NBC, I thought this would be my kind of show - Dark, Supernatural, Fairy Tales. Sounded good. However, during the first episode spending a lot of time yawning. I was bored. The idea is great - Nick discovers that he comes from a long line of ""grimms"" that police the supernatural creatures of the world. And the show imploys that the Brothers Grimm where such hunters, and that is how they gained material for their much-loved fairy tales. So, yeah, cool idea. The problem is the execution. The acting is wooden - especially from David Giuntoli, the actor who plays ""Nick."" Giuntoli is one of the most boring leading men - I have no idea why anyone would cast someone with so little charisma. The production value is low, as most of the monsters look ridiculously fake, but worst of all the show lacks any real wit or charm. For ""hunters""-of-evil type shows, stick with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Supernatural and The X-Files. Grimm offers nothing new or fresh. Truly disappointing.",2016
2,"Another one of these shows about monsters and fairies. At least there are no vampires... But it's always the same, at the beginning of the show there is some ""hunter"" who discovers that he has some hidden destiny and then he tries to fulfill it. Here it is a police-officer who discovers that he is a ""Grimm"" and his destiny is to hunt down monsters. Oh yeah, like we haven't seen stuff like this in hundred other shows... So, what makes this show different?",2014
2,"I love the idea of fairy tales gone awry. Research shows that most of the fairy tales written in the last couple of centuries weren't so ""fairy"" to begin with. The Brothers Grimm stories are amazing, I have the complete collection. So when I heard they were making a show based on this, I was excited. But then after watching I was disappointed. I've really tried but I can't get through the second episode. It is so bad I feel sorry for the poor cast! The plot is terribly weak. This show definitely needs better writers. I was actually going to rate this as one, but out of loyalty to Grimm stories, it has earned an extra point.",2011
6,"Just finished watching season 2 of Grimm on Netflix, quite a feat since there's 20 odd 40 minute episodes in each season, But there was really nothing else on... Grimm is remarkably average, I'm only leaving a review since there's so many 8s 9s and 10s, inflating the score. The acting in Grimms really not that great, with Munroe being the only standout actor. Personally I think the writings probably the worst aspect of this show, it's so predictably cheesy including typical cheesy American lines, a kind of 'let's kick some butt!' Type cheese. If you like this though then go ahead! I'd say it's all round quality is fairly comparable to doctor who, but I think the real reason I'm disappointed in Grimm is because of it's missed potential. I mean I think the ideas great, the back stories of the Wesson can be cool even if they sometimes look really bad. Think Big Bird from Sesame Street. I just feel that maybe they could have casted the characters a little better and made them more relatable, I really lack any sort of feeling towards the Grimm, I'm always rooting for some dirty angry looking creature to pull his legs off, but instead episode after episode it's just run of mill, hero always wins bad guy loses. There's no real drama or suspense, the guys invincibly boring. But yeah I've given it a 6, which I think is fair, it's definitely not the worst thing on TV but far from being a standout, easy to watch with cheap thrills. I'd have to say its ideal target audience has gotta be kids, I've thought this from the get-go, it's the kind of show that kids would love, good mix of action & fantasy, it's today's Hercules or Xena warrior princess.",2014
5,Its sad to see a series with a huge potential in terms of storyline and flair all go to sh** just because the script is plain stupid.,2015
4,"Gave it a chance with three episodes, found myself wishing I hadn't bothered.",2012
7,"I watched this show out of pure boredom with nothing else to do. But I ended up enjoying it. The first 20 minutes were quite boring. spoilers: It didn't even get interesting until the cop and the wolf first went to the mans house. but after that is what drew me in. Too be honest I am not quite sure of what to make of the show just yet, but I am hoping something amazing does come of it. It has some weird seductiveness about it, that makes you think: whats a grimm, what type of show will this be, what the hell happened in the end of the first episode. I will definitely keep watching just to see what will happen later in the season. The main problem they have is the dull boring moments, I just wish they would explain more what kind of show this is going to be. Is it going to be a cop show, with criminals and solving crimes every episode, or understanding this guys special power and into his world of ""magic"".",2011
8,"So far, so good! With the pilot episode, I was pretty much instantly hooked. It was one of the best pilots for a show that I've seen in a while. It truly gave you an in-depth look at what the show will be about and so far, it's quite entertaining. As the episode progressed, it had me wanting more and more. If it keeps this up, It'll be truly sad if it's ever taken off the air. Love the characters and great choice of main characters, the acting is good, love the set and the overall plot is very different which makes it well worth the watch. Need I say more? If you're reading this, you should try to give it a watch. I can't wait for more!",2011
9,"Not a well-known fact, but although the inimitable Joss Whedon is generally given all the credit for the Buffy/Angel phenom, in fact Joss had a partner who, while given proper billing in the opening marquee, did not often step into the limelight. That would be none other than Mr. David Greenwalt, who was kind enough to use the many skills he picked up therefrom to bring us this wonderful riff on the Grimm fairy tales. It's clever, and other reviewers here have spent a lot of time on the plot, so there is no need to go there. But as Buffy/Angel alumni know, the trick to these things is not merely story but top actors, highly developed relationships between the characters, and sharp dialogue. This show delivers. Almost from the first episode, viewers could not help but admire the oddball ""Lone Ranger/Tonto"" relationship between David Giuntoli and Silas Weir Mitchell. Bitsie Tulloch is a major find, she can not only sell her part but her eyes should be insured by Lloyds and trademarked. The supporting cast is universally good. The cliffhanger plots tend to invite a little peckishness on the part of reviewers, but, to be fair, all the new action shows are doing this, so to poke at one is to poke at them all. Greenwalt has learnt well, and knows the importance of keeping the viewer on his or her toes -- as for example in the episode when Giuntoli's character wrestles a very dangerous stranger to the ground only to find out .... it's his mother. These are the sort of treats we have come to expect from this series and if the writers don't hoist themselves on their own petards (over-write the plot arcs to death) it should remain good fun for some time.",2013
6,"So, where do I start? Grimm is one of the very few ongoing shows that I'm following. Though I was thinking about giving up on it several times now, I am still waiting for the new episode week after week. I wouldn't say it's addictive, but it's watchable if you don't have a better option. I don't like plain detective/police/CSI shows much, but with mixing in some humor or fantasy or adding some strange, new characters and focusing less on the scientific crime-solving, I am ready to give anything a try. I have to admit that Grimm has a pretty unique twist to the CSI-like story and if you're into that, you'll probably enjoy it. But here are some reasons why you might not.",2014
9,"First of all. It's sad to say, but ""Smockan"" and ""seattle_kid"" seems to have COMPLETELY missed the fact that the female police-officer Saga Norén in the series, played by Swedish actress Sofia Helin, is a portrait of a person with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type. And they unfortunately confuse it with bad acting in their reviews. Well, well...",2012
9,"So far (episode 3) ""Bron"" provides all the classic criminal genre elements with a modern and smart touch. The characters and actors fit their roles well (albeit being caricatures of the genre). I especially enjoy the humorous and feminist take on Saga Norén's character. ",2011
9,"@ Robert-Temple ""To say that it is impossible to feel even the slightest twinge of sympathy for Helin's character,"" As some one with Aspergers myself, I fully appreciate how far you are from being able to understand why you should be able to feel sympathy for Helin's character.",2012
10,"I haven't seen the Killing yet, but I will. I certainly will if it is as good as this Scandinavian crime drama. The story is very compelling, gripping and brilliantly executed. The acting is first rate, especially that of the two leads Kim Bodnia who plays Martin Rohde and the utterly brilliant Sofia Helin who plays the clever but quirky Saga Noren. I have to say she makes the show for me, alright she is blonde, beautiful and Swedish, but her performance is exceptional and you can't help but love her character. Saga works very well with Martin in trying to solve the crimes and the satellite characters and stories work equally as well. I also have to mention the direction, camera work and general production of this series as it is as good as anything I have seen. I shall be very sad when it finishes.",2012

10,"I just finished watching the whole series in 2 days. I've Never seen anything like it and I watch most every show crime and law enforcement related. After the 3rd episode, I had to check out the Saga Noren character, because I didn't understand her behavior. As soon as I typed the character name in google search, Autism and Asperger Syndrome popped up. Then I understood. Wonderful. Saga's peccadillo's' had me howling with laughter. When she thoughtfully inspected her nether region, smiled, picked up a hot date, got serviced, then turned over and went to sleep, I was just as outdone as him, but howled with laughter. When she described the killers profile, I thought she was talking about herself too in the context of the conversation. The look on her bosses' face, priceless, along with all his subsequent incredulous, exasperated looks. I've never seen as perfect a paring as Saga and Martin. Thank God for You Tube & Steven King. Mr. King wrote an article titled ""The best things I watched on TV in 2012"". That's where I heard about The Bridge. The US will be I'm sure, mucking it up in a remake. We've just got to have that unrealistic happy ending. I'm not so patiently waiting for series 2. Thank you Denmark and Sweden.",2013
10,"This Danish/Swedish co-production starts in dramatic style when a body is found in the middle of the Øresund Bridge; half in Denmark, half in Sweden. Swedish officer Saga Norén claims the case should be dealt with by the Malmo police as the head is in Sweden and she recognises the victim as a local councillor. Martin Rohde, the Danish officer sent to the scene doesn't object and it looks as if that will be that until it is realised they are dealing with two half-bodies; the top is the Swedish politician but the bottom half belonged to a Danish prostitute who had been killed a year before! Clearly the killer had been planning this for a long time. It soon becomes apparent that the killer has no intention of stopping at two deaths; he has a series of events planned and each event is intended to highlight some perceived injustices in the two countries.",2012
10,"Its Saturday 6:00 pm and the last 2 episodes are on tonight! Its a long time since I've been this hooked on a TV series. Acting, story, setting, filming are all marvellous. The two leading characters and their interplay make a new approach to the 'two opposites been thrown together as partners'. I hope it doesn't offend any sufferers but the Aspergers Disorder of one partner is in no way sad or treated lightly but is extremely funny at times. I was fortunate to record the earlier episodes before todays and have watched two on the last 4 consecutive nights (Im not deleting them and look forward further Bridge weeks in the future). Im only saying all this to encourage anyone who hasn't watch it to do so though you may have to wait for the DVDs. Its 6:15 now, 2:45 to go!",2012
8,"I guess reviewer Smockan didn't notice that Sofia Helins odd character had Aspergers Disorder which results in a very asocial behaviour. She don't know how to socialize or communicate in a normal fashion. She knows nothing about being diplomatic or ""holding back"". She's just barging in like a bulldozer. ",2012
10,I have to admit that I'm astonished. Nevertheless I will try to make it short. ,2013
10,"I absolutely loved this series. The story is intriguing from the start: a corpse is found on the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, carefully positioned so that each half is in a different country. The story that evolves from there is satisfactorily complex, without getting silly, and full of suspense. There are a lot of interesting characters in the series, but the stars are the two investigators. Saga Noren, who clearly has a fairly serious Asperger syndrome, mixes an infuriating lack of understanding of people's feelings with an endearing innocence and admirable honesty. Martin Rohde, a more traditional investigator, is a man that often doesn't really think about the consequences of his actions,and is willing to break rules. The relationship between these two provides a lot of interest and plenty of really entertaining moments. Everything is greatabout this series - the story, the ending, the characters, the music,the photography (the night shots of the bridge and the city that are interspersed during the series are mesmerising). More like this please!",2012
9,"From the opening 5 minutes of this series I was hooked, one of the finest story lines I've watched for years. This will keep you guessing until the very last episode with many twists and turns along the way.",2013
9,"To sum up in short: suspense, good acting, real empathy for the story line, great appropriate music, twists that keep you hooked wanting to keep going. The two leads are very different, and equally interesting and complex. The support cast is first rate, and the suspense just keeps building.Best drama/ mystery that I've seen for ages. Well worth it. By epp2 I was pleasantly surprised that it kept the intrigue up. By Epp3 I was thinking of ringing in sick for work to keep watching. If you like your mysteries to keep surprising you, and adding layers, and layers, then this is for you. There aren't the usual ""holywood"" dumbed down explanations at the end of each epp, instead it makes you keep thinking.I have to say that they have done a first rate job with the music score too.Although even without it, the storyline gives you plenty of emotional reaction.This is one show to set aside free time for, with out distractions. And just enjoy.",2013
8,"It was a great pleasure to watch this series. I actually missed the first episode unfortunately, but watched from episode 2 to the last one. One of the reasons i enjoyed it was that the story actually at several points resembled one of my favourite campy b-horror movies from 1971, the British ""The abominable Dr Phibes"" starring Vincent Price. There were a lot of similarities so i could eventually guess what would happen in episode 9 and 10, but it didn't ruin the experience at all.",2011
10,"The Scandi-dramas keep on coming on BBC4. This one is a corker. It's right up there with 'The Killing' - and that's saying a lot. OK, the story is not really credible, but it's a thriller, and that's what thrillers tend to be like. It fulfils the main criterion of a thriller: it's thrilling - and it kept me glued to the screen throughout (the subtitles actually help you to focus).",2012
10,"I did not think this series could get any better, but Series 3 is the best one yet. I was not sure how good this would be without Martin, but by episode 2, you are not even thinking about Martin. They introduce a new partner/s for her whom have their own unique story and problems. You are not sure what is going on with them for at least a few episodes, which I liked very much. It ends up working well on many levels. Saga's story goes deeper and is heartbreaking, as we learn more about her. Characters from her life come in and cause her troubles and it is hard to watch yet gives us more insight into her and why she is like she is. The actress who plays her can convey so much with her face and body, the way she shows us her distress as the personal tension starts to ramp up made me want to cry for her. I have to say this show has kept me on the edge of my seat and I have not been sure what is up or who did what most of the time, nor what was going to happen. This show is so well written and unique. I appreciate the uniqueness of it on all levels. There are many plot threads going on at once and they all work. Also I love how they manage to constantly work that bridge into the story visually. It is beautiful and meaningful in the context of the story. It does not feel disjointed but tightly woven and interesting. The finale was excellent and surprising. The acting is so good by the two leads, they are sure to win some awards. ",2015
10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series , and despite comments berating the lead's acting, she is supposed to have Aspergers. I have worked with people with autism for fifteen years , and I must say she does a superb job of portraying a mild form of this syndrome.",2012
10,"If you like the American version, it is heavily based on this one. However, the acting if far superior in the Swedish-Danish version, in fact I think it is one of the best cast series I have seen. If you can deal with the subtitles this is so much better. As you watch the show characters are introduced that seem to have little to do with the plot, but in a few episodes they become important. This is good in that you start to wonder what this character's involvement as the plot progresses. There is a grittiness to drama that is missing from US shows, with the characters being not such overly made-up dolls. It is interesting to see how the scenery differs from what once is accustomed to in the US.",2014
9,"This is a very intriguing show. The interaction of the 2 lead investigators is great. The Swede's personality is constantly entertaining. I haven't seen all the episodes yet, but so far we are caught up into it. I have seen other Scandinavian series and this one is up there on the list, different than Wallander for example, but quirky aspects that draw you in. The characters in shows from this region have flaws and character aspects that make you think. For US made shows, the lead police are shown at their strongest with some defining characteristic that makes them and their team the best. I think the humanity shown in the Bridge draws me in more. Also, from a US perspective, the morality and rules of conduct interest me for this show.",2013
8,"The unusual character of Saga absolutely makes what would otherwise be a superior crime drama all that much more special. Even through the veil of English subtitling that frequently left us bemused or scratching our heads, and very solid work by all of the cast and writers, it was Saga that often left us howling with laughter even in the midst of the most gruesome circumstances, and left us eager for the next episode. I was surprised to see that some other reviewers either didn't 'get' that Saga has Aspergers, or thought that Sofia Helin's performance was poor. Perhaps we had an advantage in having seen just enough of Sofia's other work to know right away that her portrayal of Saga was very deliberate. If you're looking for a taut, intriguing and often very amusing murder mystery, this is well worth your time. Superb.",2013
10,"Could go on for ever about this program but I will keep it shortish, well as short as I can as we need 10 lines! Amazing from start to finish, so many twists and turns that keeps you guessing right to the end, simply outstanding writing. And the cast, very well structured with good performances all round. The new guy Thure Lindhardt, who plays Henrick has just added another level to the program. Sofia Helin though, what a performance portraying someone with what I believe is Autistic spectrum of Asperger. Her performance as Saga just pulls you into the character more and more. I do like a good crime drama and there are plenty out there but it is hard to find amazing drama. This is a must watch for anyone who loves great TV.",2015
9,"Great storytelling with lots of action and very little slack. Moves along like a freight train transporting you from one significan event to another, with your mind feverishly trying to piece clues together and do your own futile police work as things unfold. And a little Danish-Swedish societal rivalry thrown in for fun. Both lead actors are great and Kim Bodnia I recognized from many great Danish films like Pusher and others. Sofia Helin I was less familiar with but her portrayal of Saga Norén and her idiosyncracies was so spot on I thought the actress might be like that in real life! I'm looking forward to Season Two for sure.",2012
9,"I can't believe the amount of flack this show is receiving from the simple-minded and humorless... I have news for everyone: New episodes of the Simpsons are trash... Family Guy hasn't been relevant or clever in ages... American Dad and The Cleveland Show are rip-off cash-ins. I actually read one comment that stated ""Give Seth Macfarlane another show!"" God forbid! I was a huge fan of Futurama, About the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons, Clone High, Mission Hill, Undergrads, About the first four seasons of Family Guy... so on and so forth. This is the first show that has made me really laugh in a long time. It's clever, and the humor is a bit dryer and more subtle. There are some pretty crude stuff I suppose...",2011
10,I absolutely love this show. I have never fallen in love with a television show as quickly as I have with this one.,2011
10,"I am an avid fan of animated television, and have a massive appreciation for MacFarlane's Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show. And also The Simpsons and Futurama. While Groening and MacFarlane are cartoon tycoons currently dominating animated programming, Bob's Burgers is a pleasing, utterly enjoyable change.",2014
10,"New things come and go and many are easily forgotten. There are so many shows now a days. It's hard to keep track of the good with all of the carp that some how makes it into our homes. I am so glad to say that Bobs Burger is one of those shows that you will be happy found it's way. Many things made this show be added to my favorite list and my DVR. Firstly, I love the animation. Instead of trying to look like Family Guy, The Simpsons or King of the Hill, this show stands out as looking completely different. It is gritty and looks like something that would have been on MTV in the mid 80s or early 90s. That makes me like it even more. I am writing a kids book and seeing stuff like this makes me feel good. Not everything has to look so polished. Another thing I like is the dark humor. It is the kind of thing that if you stop paying attention for just a minute, you won't get something later. I actually laughed out loud at this time after time. Which is rare these days. Something else I like about this show is the people doing the voices. Especially H. Jon Benjamin. The story I saw was really funny and memorable. All these things make me really excited about the next episode.",2011
10,"I didn't see the pilot but I just saw the second episode and it was interesting and hilarious. The plot was funny, the voices were good. I haven't looked up a show in a long time but, on the commercial break, I had to pull it up on my computer to learn more about it. ",2011
10,"With new Simpsons and Family Guy episodes failing to entertain less and less with every new episode, Bob's Burgers was a glimmering light at the end of what to me, was a dark, unfunny tunnel. On it's premiere night I decide to check it out because there wasn't to much on, and since then I have been a complete fan of the show. The plot revolves around a man and his struggling burger joint run by him, his wife and his 3 children. The premise may seem a little ""closed"" but I hope that they are able to continue it for long enough that it doesn't get boring and ridiculous, but with what they've shown so far it does not appear that they are slowing down with quirky, and original plots. The show is hilarious and the actors that voice them are perfect. I've shown this to all my room mates and everyone has become a fan, so hopefully this show will be on the air for a while.",2011
9,"When I first saw the commercials about a new cartoon-series I wasn't really impressed. Bobs burgers, about a burgershop, really..? The style was a strong reminder of Beavis and Butthead and the short commercial didn't really impress me much. Maybe I was a bit skeptical because the last years no cartoon or animation series has impressed me much. Brickleberry for example never made me laugh and I didn't like any of the characters.",2014
10,"Really can't believe the people who don't get this, maybe they should stick with ""Two and a half Men"".It reminds me of the early Simpsons before they forgot how to be funny. The voice's are spot on especially Kristen Schaal as Louise, she was one of the best things about ""Flight of the Concords"" and the slightly manic energy she had then translates well into Louise to balance the mellowness of the other characters. It also has a nice touch of the surreal which I love, not surprising considering the producer also worked on Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist another one of my favorite (under-rated) shows. I'm really starting to look forward to each new episode to see how the show develops so please don't cancel this show, give it a chance!",2011
10,"I really enjoyed the first season of Bob's Burgers. Not often for a cartoon you can say that there is chemistry between characters. In Bob's Burgers - there is. The calm and usually serious, but funny dad, mother who's full of weird ideas, and children, each so different. The youngest daughter is definitely my favorite with her unpredictable attitude towards many usual things.",2012
10,"The simple fact that Kevin Kline is involved, should be enough for anyone to understand the caliber of this series. The entire cast playing the Belchers is spot on and only gets better with each episode. This show has a new and fresh vibe to it, but also has a certain familiar attribute; a family trying to do the best that they can with what they have and having a little fun along the way. A surprisingly exceptional character is found in Louise, played by Kristen Schaal. While all the characters have redeeming qualities of their own, Louise's character is in my opinion one of the most exuberantly funny. She is the comic relief more often than not. Each episode takes you on a new adventure, theme, idea, premise, etc.. Lots of variety keeps the show interesting. Overall- Outstanding series, but could use more of Regular Sized Rudy.",2014
2,"As I begin, I have to find it amusing that the reviews are split between overly generous (after all, even people who found this a ""guilty pleasure"" could not justify giving this a 9 or 10 rating) and those who consider it ""terrible"". That always says something about a show. Especially when favorable reviews get an inordinate number of ""useful"" votes and the unfavorable reviews get an inordinate number of ""not useful"" votes. All this, despite the discussion boards reflecting mostly negative opinions.",2011
1,"It's hard to believe that Fox would cancel Allen Gregory, yet keep this trash on air. Bobs Burgers is the definition of crap animation. Never before have I seen a show that is as painfully unfunny as this is. You know a show is awful when they have to repeat a sentence for over a minute for laughs. The awful animation might have been acceptable on Adult Swim, but this is Primetime and is just pathetic. The creators behind the show don't even attempt to do anything new or original here. The episodes I have seen have plots that have already been done on other similar animated shows. The voice acting is lazy and just goes to show that the people behind the show are just as untalented as they were on Home Movies. There really is no better way to put it than besides saying to stay away from Bobs Burgers. It could possibly be the worst Burger you will ever have.",2012
1,"Another failed attempt by Fox to fill the cursed half-hour-after-The-Simpsons time slot. The animation is uninteresting, the jokes predictable and pedestrian, the plot line weak --Premier show was about possible problems with health inspector who happened to be an ex boyfriend of Bobs wife. Seen this before in several movies and other shows.",2011
1,"After all the hype for the last two months, I was expecting something worth watching (at least). What a disappointment! I can't believe that FOX believes that this steaming pile of manure has any business being on their network. Of course, this is the same network that cancelled Futurama so maybe it isn't actually so hard to understand after all.",2011
1,"I was bored and decided to watch this show. BIG mistake. Not only was the animation bad but the episode I watched was horrid. I'm surprised that Fox allowed this show to go on the air let alone go on with as many episodes as it has so far. I think I would rather watch a Barney marathon than see another episode of this show. And to have male voices play female parts. Not saying there's anything wrong with that but with the bad animation we don't know if these characters are male or female. My advice to the actors and actresses is do not put this show on your resume. I wish I could vote lower than 1 star but alas I can not. Now if you have insomnia or some sleeping disorder, this show will most likely cure that.",2011
1,"I have never bothered to write a review before. Voting have been enough but this show was so abysmally bad I have to speak out. The characters are a cut and paste TV cartoon family. It tries to be deadpan, but deadpan need intelligent humour so it fails. It is vulgar but not shocking delivered with family friendly tone which makes it dull.",2011
1,Of all the shows fox canceled or never even let see the light of day this one has to be the single worst piece of trash I've ever seen. Its just beyond horrible.,2011
7,"I'm going to keep this short. This show has no potential to make it for an entire season, and yet I wish it would. All it is, is a show about a guy and his family who own a burger shop (As you can tell in the commercials). The comedy is extremely dry, the main voices are all male (even for the womens roles), and the artwork will make some people sick. But, I watched the entire show laughing all the time. I am certainly going to be watching this show again if not mainly for the voice of H. Jon Benjamin. He's the voice of the movie buff in family guy who always talks with Chris about random boob shots. His voice was so impeccably perfect for this off-beat comedy that I can do nothing but laugh at him and his supporting cast. If you have some time, give this show a shot, especially since it won't last long.",2011
1,"Historically, humor's intent has been to evoke laughter, and so this leads us into pretty broad territory. After all, some get all atwitter at an erudite Oscar Wilde witticism, while others break up at the sound of that armpit farting noise. Thus, it's possible that almost ANYTHING can be defined as humorous. On the other hand, for something to be commercially successful, it has to push the humor buttons of a broad cross-section of the public. For better or worse, Bob's Burgers does not seem to possess the capacity to push many buttons.",2011
8,"As a long time fan of The Simpsons, Family Guy and Animation Domination I have to say, ""Bobs Burgers is just horrible"". I have read the reviews of the others who say this is fresh and brilliant but fortunately it will only take one viewing to realize it's a boring waste of time. I thought I would give it another chance but during tonight's episode (02-20-11) I found myself drifting off and having a conversation with my girl about her feelings. Thank god for commercials or I might have had to change the channel. I enjoyed (King of the Hill), I enjoyed (Futurama) but this show seems desperate and unimaginative. The ""protect the cow"" episode, done on South Park, The Simpsons and who knows what else. The characters are not very likable and much too slow moving for an animated show. Please Fox, remove this mess and if you can't come up with something better than at least give a past success another chance like you did for Family Guy..",2011
1,"I really wanted this show to be funny. Like, Family Guy or The Simpson's funny. But, it's not. In fact, it's not funny at all. It's lame. I can't sit through it. Believe me, I have tried. It's predictable. The attempts at being edgy are ineffective. At this juncture I find that I have an extra 30 minutes on Sunday evening to fart around in the garage till something funny comes on.",2011
1,"So yesterday, I heard from my brother that they were giving away an episode of Family Guy on iTunes for free, so naturally, I bought it. I found out that Bob's Burgers was attached to it, so I figured I would watch it to see if it was any good. After laughing my way through Family Guy, I continued watching to see what this was like...and shut it off about 10 minutes into it. I thought it might be kind of funny from the opening montage of the burger shop getting destroyed multiple times, but when the actual episode started, I was horrified that this even got funded. After endearing 10 minutes filled with a boy making fart sounds from a megaphone; A girl commenting, out of the blue mind you, that her crotch itched; and more jokes, that if executed properly, would have been hilarious, but fell flat when attempted by Bob's Burgers, I decided that I had wasted enough brain cells on it. So, if you enjoy scripts that seem like they were written by 5-year-olds who had just heard a few dirty jokes, then this is the show for you.",2011
10,"This show is absolutely amazing.I stopped watching family guy a while ago since it just got repetitive, and it wasn't even funny anymore. I had my doubts about this show, thinking that it would be another family and it would be boring. I WAS DEAD WRONG. This show is genius. I haven't laughed this hard during a TV show before. I mean it is freaking hilarious. My favorite episode was the art crawl one (season 1 episode 8).",2012
1,"after watching this show, it's easy to see it is just filler and no where near a 10. Personal opinions aside, if you look up the history of all the people that voted it a 10, it's easy to see that they are all probably paid media plants, never having posted on IMDb before, typing about the same amount of ""review"". this is the practice of plants. random names, random locations around the world.",2011
8,"British TV viewers have been spoiled with great detective shows over the past decades. Bergerac, Inspector Morse and Frost have trained us to expect quirky, interesting shows with characters who become part of British culture. It's early days yet, but I think that 'Death in Paradise' has the chance to join them.",2011
9,"So many TV shows try to make ""guessing"" the murderer nearly impossible. They add irrelevant sub-plots, secrets that are only revealed at the end and over complicated characters that cause confusion. I've just watched episode 6 and I guessed the murderer straight away. But do you think this took away any of the enjoyment of this excellent murder mystery? not in the slightest. The characters are witty & charming and every episode draws one closer to each off the personalities. I eagerly await every new episode. I'm a Brit living in Cape Town, which I consider to be paradise, but one can't help but fall in love with this quirky little Caribbean island.",2011
9,"Death in Paradise is very easy to watch, even if you despise the old fashioned workings of the likes of Miss Marple and Poiroit you can grow to love this murder mystery.",2011
7,well the stereotypes are pleasant and the program is very easy to watch.,2013
10,"The brits never seem to get tired of their sherlock holmes stories but I guess we Americans like our Inspectors with lots of Gadgets...Anyways, I only watched this show because one of the reviewers on here said that the lead character was a classic in the making. I have to agree with that. What makes this show interesting is the characters. With a title like ""Death In Paradise"" it sounds like a dark drama but it's really quite light and very enjoyable watching the typical stiff arrogant brit making his way a round a crime scene in Saint Marie island while also looking for afternoon tea and biscuits in the noon hour. This show has huge potential. I like it a lot",2011
6,"DI Richard Poole, Ben Miller, finds himself unwilling transferred to an island in the Caribbean that has a very French flare. Initially he is sent to investigate the murder of a colleague but his success brings him complications: what was to be a one off becomes a permanent mission. The lush surroundings and assistance by Camile Borday, Sara Martins, an undercover officer who now finds herself playing Watson to Pool's Holmes add to the fun. The writing is sharp and the supporting characters are excellent. But will DI Poole who retains his London suits and longs for a decent cuppa ever find contentment on what for anyone else would be the assignment of a lifetime. Don't bet on it.",2012
10,"This series is an absolute winner. It was created with flair, humour and suspense. The actors were well chosen and truly work well together. I just love watching each episode and with my PVR able to watch them over and over again. This is one series that must be and should be continued. Each show is well photographed, acted and well written. This is truly a top rated show and I really hope it will continue. It is such a relief to be able to watch a series that is both entertaining and interesting. The tropical setting adds a totally different aspect and is well integrated. Very well done. Whoever thought this one up should be proud of their effort. Let's keep this one going. As usual another British show is first class and puts the USA and Canadian programmes out in the cold. Keep up the good work folks!",2013
9,"I agree with the other reviewers of this show, that it is witty, charming and strangely addictive. I think the reason it works so well is not the murder mysteries themselves, but the interplay of the characters and the quirkiness of DI Poole (a great role for Ben Miller). All the actors involved seem to be having a good time and there is great chemistry between them. The list of guest 'suspects' is also impressive. The beautiful setting doesn't hurt either! It is an old school, comfy, Brit detective show - but with a unique style - and I hope it runs for as long as ""Midsomer"" did. I'm finding I need my weekly fix of Ste. Honore!",2013
6,This was great fun to watch. But then most of the cast left and their replacements are dreadful! Whoever decided that it was OK to replace Camile by Florence and Fidel by J.P. should get laid off immediately!,2017
10,"As an Aussie I obviously lean towards British titles when it comes to favoritism. Death in Paradise is no exception. I love it. The characters are great (particularly DI Richard Poole, played by Ben Miller), he is exemplary. ",2013
9,"Totally delightful. Very clean so far which is refreshing. I don't have to worry about who watches it, or be embarrassed. My hubby and I are veteran mystery fans in all genres. We seldom guess the ending or the twists along the way. Clever plots. Accents do take a little getting used to and I sometimes just don't catch what they say. And like most productions these days, the ambient noise blurs the dialog a bit--wish all films would just quit doing that. Lead man, DI Poole, is a great character--combines a little of Miss Marple and Poirot. Sara Martins is exotically gorgeous and a good character. Sometimes it starts to slide towards cheesiness but usually stops short so keeps the show from becoming slapstick. Goofy characters make me switch channels and this show doesn't have one. Have now got other family hooked on it. I hope it has a long run.",2013
7,"I would have given this a 10 out of 10 if Ben Miller was still the lead, he was absolutely brilliant as DI Poole; he was natural and funny, smart in his own way, and, most of all, the culture clash was very entertaining. However, once Ben Miller was out, followed by Sara Martins, the show lost its unique appeal. I'm still watching because of the gorgeous setting and the brilliant writing, however, Kris Marshall as DI Goodman is just boring, and why did they resort to that cliché of a clumsy man trying to find a woman? It is the worst aspect of the show. I understand that Ben Miller wanted out to spend more time with his family, but they should have found a better replacement for him.",2016
2,"The first two seasons were excellent, led by Ben Miller's DI Poole. With a clever London detective in conflict with the laid-back Caribbean, this series relied more on characterization than plot, and the result was wit and charm. It was original, with intriguing interplay among the characters and a most welcome alternative to the current spate of dark, British mysteries. Then, upon Miller's voluntary departure, the producers—for some unknown reason—replaced him with Kris Marshall as DI Goodman. Exit the wit and charm. Enter an uninteresting, clumsy doofus who, unfortunately, looks the part. Exit also my desire to continue watching this series.",2015
5,this show by far was quite possibly my favorite show ever. however season 3 and beyond have ruined that for me. since the death of Richard the only character I actually liked the whole reason I watched the show as a matter of fact. his replacement just isn't the same and I cannot for the life of me like him at all. oh my god I hate him so much he is ridiculous and stupid. every time he opens his mouth I literally want to punch the actor in the face. The only joy that I actually got out of life was tuning in to see Richard solve crimes in his quirkyway. I tried to like him I truly did but he's just so irritating. I hope whoever wrote Richard off the show was fired on the spot. This is even worse than losing my own father...figuratively of course.,2015
3,"Watching the first two seasons what thoroughly enjoyable. Funny, witty, charming cast. Made me want to watch again and again. Then Poole left and in come Chris. Maybe a nice actor but character he played here is just wrong. A complete dunce. I only watched because of the remaining cast. Story lines were always good. I continued on and now in season six they made another change. Going from serious actor to comic actor is the wrong move now they go to a stand up comedian. The only thing I am waiting for now is the cape and sun visor helmet he usually wears. Thermo man to the rescue. NOT. Maybe you can bring Poole back from the dead, say it was all a dream, or nightmare.",2017
3,"What a super, super duper show! At first. Alas that is no longer the case. When Fidel, then Camille left they took with them the crux of the show. The bouncing off each other, the camaraderie and genuine concern for each other no longer works. Chris Marshall's mumbling was at first endearing & I truly gave him a shot - then it became monotonous and insufferable. I happened upon this show by accident a few years ago and I stuck with it for the premise was refreshing and new. I loved how the personal stories intersected with the cast and it made for great TV. Ben Miller was very good and it took me a while to warm up to him also but now I've lost interest with the new crew. Too bad - great beginning with a great cast now is lost at sea.",2015
10,"I give Death in Paradise a ""10"" not because I can't imagine a better show, but simply because I can't think of any specific thing I would change.",2013
10,"Normally I'm not really a big fan of crime series but I really enjoyed this one! Well, okay, the plot is always the same: there's a murder, there are clues, then Inspector Poole solves the case. But there's something about this series that kept me watching. Maybe the Caribbean setting and the lighthearted feeling it creates. Maybe the characters, all of which are very likable and sympathetic. Maybe the dialogues, which are funny but never stupid or dull. Maybe all of this together. I think the scripting is really good! I did not find any arbitrary twists, all of the cases and the clues presented seemed logical to me. And finally, the acting is great, so I give this a 10.",2013
7,"This show began as a master craft of wit and a perfect balance of sexual tension .. I gave the first 2 seasons with Ben Miller and Sara Martins a perfect 10 .. Then the wit and sarcasm were replaced with the fumbling milquetoast Kris Marshall and thus began the descent ...then Sara Martins leaves and poof ..the decline hastens ... Oh, I almost failed to mention the replacement of Gary Carr, this was just the last nail in the coffin.. From a solid 10 to a marginal 7 .. What a shame ... This was my favorite show .. Once upon a time. The entire premise of the show was replaced with characters ,who in other venues might have added something to the story but us viewers having feasted on the wit and sarcasm of D.I. Poole which played off perfectly against Sara Martins attempts to loosen his tie and her admiration for his intellect are now left asking",2015

3,"It is quite rare for me not to love a British mystery series. I watched this one with the lead actor Kris for five shows and stopped watching. However, today our PBS channel showed the first episode with Ben Miller and it was wonderful (and the reason for the 3 stars). I understand that Ben Miller wanted to leave the show to spend time with his family. But why on earth they picked this guy to replace him is beyond me! He has absolutely no personality. He just seems to smirk through the episodes so he can get his paycheck. The writing is good, and other actors are fine. I just can't see them all working well together in the fictional police station or even as actors. SPOILER ALERT!! Hopefully, they'll rescue what few viewers they have left and bump this guy off for another actor too.",2014
8,"I must confess it took me a while to warm to this series. But the more I watched the more I liked it. Death in paradise has become, in the lexicon, compulsively watchable for me, being as it is an amiable take on the old Agatha Christie formula. I didn't see the episodes with the prior star but have come to like the new sleuth. He's laid back, clever and refreshingly ordinary, and a bit insecure as far as his personal life is concerned. The main rub of the series is the lush Caribbean setting. 'Saint-Marie' is a fictional island comprised of half-Brit, half-French cultural references. How is it most of the local characters speak with Jamaican accents? Actually the filming location as I understand is the island of Guadoloupe. Whatever. With all the spectacular scenery and the sleuth's fetching island girl assistant, how can we worry about quibbles? Eight stars.",2014
2,"This began as a different kind of detective show and was quit enjoyable. Now in its 8th year it is truly on its last legs and needs to be taken out back and humanely put to sleep. The plot is the same every week, they have run out of ideas. All it is now is a way for the BBC to reward it's stars with a free holiday on a sun soaked island. There are some great characters so it is truly a shame to see them trotting out the same awful scripts week after week.

After two days of deliberations and endless discussions, we voted to convict. On our way out of the courtroom, I remember distinctly the high spirits we were all in. We had done our job as citizens. We had helped take a bad man off the streets. We helped get justice for a murdered individual. There were a lot of smiles and handshakes and back-pats. Then on the way out we passed the convicted man's eight-month-along pregnant wife. She was sitting, alone, on a bench outside the courtroom, sobbing. The implications of our decision for her and that unborn child hit me all at once as we passed. I wasn't smiling anymore; none of us were. The thing is, I still believe we did the right thing. It was our job to vote on the evidence and that's what we did. But even so, I'd be lying if I said I slept soundly that night.",2011
9,"I had to watch this twice, the two hour premiere that is. I think what struck me most was the calm and slow storytelling. When TV is drowning in unrealistic CSI's et al (where investigators cook up fingerprints to techno music in dimly lit rooms), every time we pass a CSI on channel surfing my husband always says 'don't they ever turn on the freakin lights in that office?' and we both laugh.",2011
10,"I was quite hesitant about watching a US production of The Killing after reading negative reviews comparing it to the Danish original, but in the end opted to do so and am very glad I did. What an excellent production! I love the understated mood that somehow manages to amp up the tension so much better than a lot of the hysterical, overacted BS one CAN get with some American crime-themed shows. This one is a standout.",2012
10,"I am writing this after the first season finale, and I came to this without expecting much and what a shocking pleasant surprise it was and absolute gem of a thriller.",2011
10,"I haven't seen the original Danish version and America has always received flack for their versions of European films or series. I have to say though The Killing US is slow, dreary, and brilliant! The first episode was gut-wrenching and I was sucked in straight away. It is very slow, not much happens in each episode but it allows for the viewer to feel the pain and frustration of the family and the police in finding the culprit. If I had watched the Danish version I cannot say I would feel the same. Obviously the original is always better but I think people are being unfair in slating the US version. A must-see in my opinion.",2012
9,"Having watched the Danish original ""Forbrydelsen"" it was with great anticipation and some apprehension that I finally got to see the American adaption to this outstanding and huge successful drama. I was both surprised and amazed. ""The Killing"" has managed to maintain the somber and somewhat dark ambiance of the original while still incorporating enough elements to make the current version plausible. Kudos to the cast of this version which has kept the integrity of the original and so far, it looks every bit as good as I could have hoped. Although the plot takes its time to unfold, it's well worth the wait. Soon you will be trying to guess who killed the beautiful High School student and realize that nothing is as it seems, each episode offering a different perspective (and suspect) until the tantalizing conclusion. Get hooked!! ;)",2011
10,"Definitely in the top 3 of the best TV series I've ever watched, leaves you hungry for more after each episode! Everything is presented very realistically, every character is amazingly arranged and put together.",2014
10,"OK, maybe 10 stars is a bit exaggerated but I just couldn't help myself. I've seen a lot of shows in the genre, including all the CSIs, NCISes, Criminal Minds (plus Suspect Behavior), and so on and so on. You get my point, I've seen a lot and it's pretty hard for a new show to impress or surprise me. This one is different. Refreshingly different. So, in comparison to all its direct competitors there is a full 10 above my review, well deserved, even though it may not be the greatest show you've seen on TV. ",2011
9,This is the Americanized version of a Danish series. I use the word Americanized as that aspect probably goes some way to explaining some of the negative reviews on here that encourage people to watch the Original Danish version. I watched one episode of the Danish version but decided I didn't want to have to READ every (subtitled) episode and so moved on to the Americanized version.,2012
8,"""The Killing"" is an adaptation of a Danish TV series, and was billed to me as ""Twin Peaks meets 24"". Well it certainly does seem like an updated ""Twin Peaks"" so far, minus some of the bizarre twists and turns. Not that there's anything wrong with that, beautiful-girl-murdered is a time-tested premise that makes for a good crime drama.",2011
10,"I think this series benefited by using fairly unknown (to me any way) actors, unlike the British version which brought us heavy weight star Kenneth Brannagh. I watched this, puzzling from day one just who did murder Rosy Larsen. I recommend watching both Series One and Two over a week or so as we did. I am in England and downloaded the first episode to compare it to the British offering. Go back to the stage Kenneth, this set in Seattle series has your version beat hands down. It was mesmerizing and very thought provoking and I sincerely hope Series Three is coming shortly and that it will be as eye opening and have as many twists and turns as this has had. Watch this series, unbeatable entertainment.",2012
10,"I've grown attached to Linden and Holder as characters, and that's rare for me. Michelle/Linden has that tough exterior, but allows you to warm to her after a few episodes. Michelle gives a brilliant emotional experience by the end of the 3rd season,and the some. And Holder, the big lug, he's a mixture of cocky/fragile detective, but naive in any ways. Thank goodness Netflix gave us another crime to follow, as well as a good, solid ending for both characters. It's rare you find such a well written show with zero ego, great storyline, characters you can relate to with a beautiful backdrop of life lessons and scenery, but The Killing delivers. I highly recommend it to anyone. The only, only negative is Holder's love interest. I found her to be quite boring, and not needed. She hindered character growth a little for him by being too perfect, if that makes sense. I'd have rather him been with someone like Bullet, or Linden. Maybe even single. I don't want to spoil it for new viewers, so just watch, you'll not regret it.",2014
10,"It's unfortunate that the series is ending, and luckily we get one last season on Netflix. I heard about the Killing from some friends, some mentioned the US version and some mentioned the original version. Since the US version was on Netflix, we streamed it and slowly got hooked.",2014
9,"My rating 9/10, is only for the first 2 seasons and only if you have the whole 26 episodes at your disposal.",2013
10,"I've watched the first two seasons of The Killing which completed the Rosie Larsen story arc. You will not find more compelling television anywhere, including the best seasons of 24 and Homeland. Comparing apples with oranges, it ranks with the outstanding House of Cards in excellence. ",2017
6,"The Killing is a re-imagining of the excellent Danish original Forbrydelsen. For the first couple of episodes they are almost word for word. Unfortunately it is when the story steps out from the core plot, the death of Rosie Larsen, that it comes unstuck. In the main it does hold that same slow gripping pace and the story taking unexpected turns but its choice of back-story is weak. The excessive focus on Sarah Linden and her son, her home life and the peculiar disconnected relationship with her mostly unseen fiancé are immensely distracting. Many of the other characters,especially the marginally psychotic Belko Royce, are utterly dysfunctional. While it is a grim tale there is little about the characters that makes you warm to them. ",2011
10,I really enjoyed The Killing. I cannot stand to watch cop shows where the killer is caught in one hour minus commercial time by wise cracking investigators who find one key clue through a microscope. This story felt real to me - like I was watching a real investigation take place. The atmosphere and mood of the show was compelling. I could feel the Larsen family's grief and I am glad that the story followed their efforts to cope with it throughout the two seasons.,2012
10,"Apparently I reviewed the Original version of this series. Here are my thoughts. 1. Wrapping up the murder of Rosie Larson in 1 season wouldve made this show like every other crime drama. Typical. Real life doesn't wrap up so neatly. That part got me hooked. 2. The chemistry between Enos & Kinnaman was delicious because it was subtle and hidden. I kept thinking why is Holder letting Linden be such a bitch to him. I was checking for them to hook up but knew it would devalue the storyline so I waited, knowing that they were perfect for one another and made an awesome duo. 3. I think Mireille Enos is an amazing actress. I like Holder's character more but Linden was played to perfection! 4. The moody rain, the dark secrets, the sadness the characters portrayed, the music at the end of each episode, the vernacular that was used, even the makeup to make them look tired and worn from no sleep & no food, all added up to make this series more real than any other fiction I have ever seen on TV. All in all this is my favorite show ever and I don't think it was given the credit it earned!",2014
10,"This is one of the most, if not the best murder-investigation series I've ever seen! ",2016
9,"Just like Bron and True Detective, the series follows two cops trying to solve a murder. I started watching this after seeing both Bron (swedish/danish series) and True Detective, and my reaction is like - wow. I love this kinds of shows. When the atmosphere is breathing trough the TV into your couch when looking, its a good sign. When I started watching True Detective I was so stuck that I ended up with seeing all the episodes in like 3 days, this happened with Bron and now its happening with The Killing. Last night I said to myself to look at one - I ended up with 8 and I went to bed in the morning. The head-actors in this series, Joel Kinnaman and Mireielle Enos are doing great. Very proud of my Swedish brother Joel, he rules the role of Holder.",2014
10,"The most intriguing, unique, and impressive show in years, this is destined to be a breakout hit. You will see Emmy gold and you can quote me on that. So why does this crime drama stand out from the rest?",2011
1,"I see all these reviews saying they loved this show. I don't get it. The writing is awful. Just plain awful. The best part of the show is the cinematography. The acting is decent enough. But the writing is just bad, lazy writing. In season 4, as an example, Skinner, the police Lt. in charge of the investigation is shot and killed and no one looks for him for two weeks. That in and of it's self is so implausible, it is baffling. The idea that Linden wouldn't just report the incident, even if to allow closer to the families of all the victims that have yet to be found is ludicrous. There would be an investigation, sure, but in the end, I believe in real life, she would have been thrown off the force is all. As bad as they may be for Holder or Reddick, Linden said on more then one occasion that she was only coming back to be a cop to help with this one case, so, no biggie really. And, I believe she wouldn't even be in that kind of trouble. That is just an example of the poor writing which litters this show likes a cat litter box full of turds. The way Holder speaks to Lincoln's mom , or Lincoln for that matter, is insane, would never happen. I have not finished episodes 5 and 6 of season 4 yet, and am told that the teasing of Kyle will make sense later, but I simply don't find any of that plausible. Oh, and the idea that High School students at a military school would be learning military tactics ( AKA the Osama Bin Laden raid lecture) also makes zero sense. These are not Military cadets. They are HIGH SCHOOL students. history, Math, English . .not how to take down an international terrorist. The Wire, Homicide, NYPD Blue, The Shield, heck (roll my eyes for being forced to use heck in this review), even Barney Miller are better cop shows. Very disappointing show.",2014
8,"Like another reviewer has stated, when I first saw the trailer for Teen Wolf, I was totally uninterested. The only reason I watched the first episode was because it came on directly after the MTV movie awards and there was nothing else on TV. I was actually surprised by how good it was. The acting was good, the special effects weren't too cheesy, and there is something dark and edgy about it. I admit some parts of the plot are predictable, but then again, there are some things that flat out surprised me. The actor who plays Stiles is fantastic, and I think he is a big part of why I like the show. Also, Derek Hale's character isn't too bad on the eyes, either. ",2011
7,"Don't judge this series from the title. Please simply don't. There are various potential open to further interpretation and this piece is fantastically fun! I think the producers should seriously think about updating the ""name"" though. Now Watch and Love!! ",2012
8,--MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--,2011
8,"When I started watching the first episode, I didn't expect anything, cause I didn't know the actors nor what the story was going to be. At the end I realized it was quick, it had funny dialogues, it wasn't not pretentious and it was absolutely FUN! It's what was made to be! While Twilight is boring to death since it's kind of ""ashamed"" for dealing with Vampires and the fantasy world, by creating a non sense story as a fake background to hold the pretentious characters and to make it look serious, Teen Wolf is what Twilight fails to be, FUN! The character of Stiles is really funny and Dylan O'Brien I think delivered that role great. Tyler Posey is exactly was the people behind casting had in mind for Teen Wolf. The rest of the cast fulfills the whole team successfully. ",2011
10,"All the actors grow as the show goes on, but Dylan O' Brian is the one with a definite career. After part B of season 3 the, Stiles is by far my favorite. He's so funny and Dylan O' Brian has shown a range. This show is only underrated because it's aired on MTV, but everyone should give it a chance. My second favorite TV show!!!! My number on being Breaking Bad! It's gotten so dark and suspenseful since season 1. I promise you will not be disappointed. It's super gory and has lot's of blood so gore fans this is a must watch. It's also very funny at times as well. I think the scariest thing on the whole entire show was Void Stiles, without spoiling too much. Thank god MTV put out something amazing!!!",2014
9,"So I heard about this show called Teen Wolf. My friends, both males and females, told me about it and said i should check it out. My first though was ""Oh geeze, not another cheesy, twilight tween flick.."" So I decided to check it out anyways. After watching it, I was quite surprised and much more impressed than what I expected it to be. This is NOTHING like twilight. Sure, it contains some of the clichés Twilight contains, but other than that there is no correlation and A LOT of television shows have clichés like the ones in this show. It also has an interesting story line that is actually pretty good. Although this show is actually quite good, it has its flaws. The acting at some times is forced, but for the most part it is good. The special effects are also lacking, but many good shows also lack this aspect and are still very successful (such as NCIS). I want to point out that I am in fact MALE and not female so this review is from the point of view of an average guy, not some girl who drools over these types of shows. In fact, this is actually one of the first that I am interested in. If this keeps up the pace and doesn't turn into a cliché-fest, this show could be very successful. Although at the time I'm writing this there are only five episodes, it is nonetheless an interesting and thrilling show that everyone should check out.",2011
9,"First time I saw the commercial to this show, I was really disappointed. Teen Wolf should remain in the 80's where it belongs. Why? Well... it's 80's cheesy to me, but I still love the film. I really thought this was going to be some cheesy rip off... oh how wrong I was. I LOVE THIS SHOW! It's about time that werewolves get the spotlight. No more Twilight glittery vampires that look constipated or stalk you while you sleep. No cheesy vampire brother love triangle with a girl that looks like a girl from their past that happened to change them into vamps. Don't get me wrong. I love vampires but werewolves are hard to make appealing because they are cursed with a curse that brings natural beast out of them.",2011
8,"OK. I just started watching this show, and I love it! Some people here might have said it's similar to the ""Twilight"" franchise, but it's only because a teen boy gets bit by a supernatural entity (in this case, a werewolf), plus he is captivated by the new girl at school, but that is where the similarities between the two end. So don't attempt to compare them. I'm not, just simply giving my opinion. Teen Wolf is a really suspense filled show dealing with a creature that has been told about in legend and folklore for centuries-the werewolf. Although I prefer vampires, especially Anne Rice types, over werewolves, I must say . . . Teen Wolf gets my thumbs up! The actors are doing well so far, especially the ones playing Scott, Allison, & Derek. Give this show a good chance, please :)",2011
7,"If you view this series as directly related to the 1985 movie, you WILL be disappointed. But if you view it as ""loosely inspired by"", and as a horror series where the drama is pretty significant, and the humour is more a side bit, and it's easy to see that this series has some impressive potential.",2011
9,"Okay, when i first saw this preview, i thought oh no ! not another lame MTV show! The trailer did not give this show its credit. I decided to watch the first episode , just to see what it was like. And I tell you what. Its fantastic. The actors have true talent for their age. Many people think this is a lame ""Twilight"" Copycat show, It definitely is not. It doesn't even have vampires in it . Plus the storyline is actually based on the person with the supernatural ability, and his day to day struggles, of adjusting with his new ability of being a werewolf. It shows some actual storyline. Other than Twilight. The Plot is better than i expected. The storyline for each episode is well suited, ( the writer and producer are doing a good job of not rushing the storyline) Plus the swoon- worthy guys . (Derek and Jackson) sorry not a big fan of Scott! But to tell you the truth I am disgusted at how people are rating this show. Its unfair. Its only into its 5th episode, (the show is still explaining itself) . The highly commend Vampire Diaries, started out pretty mediocre if you ask me. So please guys give this a chance . Im sure we haven't seen the best of Teen Wolf for ages. I am so excited each week to see every episode.",2011

10,"When I first saw the advertisements, all that was going through my head was ""Oh god. Another supernatural show!""",2011
1,This show started out gold the first two seasons great! 3a was a bit shaky but redeemed itself with season 3b..till they decided to put together romances that didn't have enough time to develop or make sense..since than from season 4 onwards its been a repetitive mess that just reuses old scenes but with new people. ,2015
9,"My friend had been pestering me to watch this show for a year but I would always refuse. From the little I knew, I had only heard about there being wolves and an unnecessary amount of shirtlessness. Both of course are true but there is another element to the show that makes it different.",2015
10,"Wow how is teen wolf not rated over 8/9 it's amazing!!! I accidentally watched one of the first season episodes and since I did iv been hooked! (Obsessed) It's funny, got loads of action, keeps you on edge, And the best bit it's not overly predictable! Also Shelley hennig is amazing 😳",2014
10,"At first I didn't think i'd like this series, the name sounded cheesy and it never really appealed to me, but boy I was wrong. The pilot episode was brilliant and made me watch about 5 episodes in one night, the acting was terrific and the story line was so interesting. Not one episode left me disappointed. Every character plays their role well and the casting is perfect.Season 1 was great it was action packed and had a brilliant story line and perfect music, season 2 it just got better and better, introducing other characters, but not too many to go over the top (like vampire diaries did). It was just right. Season 3 was just amazing, it blew my mind and made me love every character in it. It had a great soundtrack and once again a good story line and not at all tacky. Throughout the series you really witness the actors improve and grow. Especially Stiles (Dylan O'Brian)he was brilliant in all the seasons but in season 3 really excelled and was mind-blowing. I would recommend it to anyone, it has something from every genre. I love this series so much and can't wait for season 4!",2014

Werewolf are way cooler,earns more respect than being a vampire! it has story,it got the teenage love without the""Girlylove) it involves family,friendship,Thrust and humor! Its story continues in exiting phase, without a bunch of side stories. All characters has its on story and makes you believe in them. This is a series for people who love typical high school movies,but with an grownup story,all from the first episode it gets you involved ,laughter ,scare,tension!Every episode gives you questions of what happens next? but yet nothing is revealed like you thought in your head! i recommend this series!",2015

9,"From the first episode, I found New Girl to be my favourite new series. The premise of the show, a girl living with 3 guys and hilarity ensues, is not the most original, nor the most realistic.

I mean, the premise of this show is that she - Zooey Deschanel - plays a bubbly, quirky-but-cute girl who moves into an all-guys apartment. Now, that's the same character she plays in every film and every series she's ever been in. It's also the same persona she uses when she sings in her band, or gives interviews, or (I imagine) blogs about baking Dr. Seuss-themed cupcakes for a company of lumberjacks.",2013

I really hate stupid awkward moments that make people uncomfortable, but the awkward moments in this show are so laughable it makes it so funny to watch. Each character has their own crazy personality. The characters remind me of The Big Bang Theory characters, each one is super important, has their own humor, and the chemistry is fantastic. I like how they make it OK to be adults in their 30s and not have their entire lives figured out and it's really relatable to a wide category of viewers. the main character Jess is adorable, hilarious, and so likable. Its great fun and super entertaining and you'll surely laugh out loud.",2013

But what I absolutely DO NOT understand is why on Earth, everyone and their mother ""raves"" about ""New Girl."" Now, I've liked my share of flops, either from fandom (yes....I did like the Dare Devil movie....flame now or forever hold your peace.), or because it was catchy in the beginning.....Kyle XY season 1 was so well written and reasonably acted, I watched until the show's demise, and even petitioned a return, which seldom works...I know.",2012
1,"I am writing this in hopes that someone who matters may listen. New Girl used to be hilarious and enjoyable. Over the past season, I have noticed that many changes have happened and each one sucks: New writer or new writers because the content has changed; Damon Wayans Jr is not funny and this seemed to coincide with his appearance; The show has essentially become an advertisement for sponsors - last week it was Target and this week it was Tommy Hilfiger. Oh yes, and they just started doing the corny ending to most episodes where everyone sings together..... Gah!",2014

Perhaps she cannot pull off a leading actress role. Even her acting in this series is terrible. I was so disappointed after the first episode. Even more surprising was the rave reviews it was receiving. So I thought, OK maybe I missed something. I tried to watch the second episode but i felt like i was insulting my intelligence and had to change the channel. I think Zooey should stick to the big screen.",2011
2,"Frankly I don't find this series to be funny enough to be called a comedy. The jokes fall off short they are not funny and they are sexual at times when they don't need to be sexual. And I don't think the acting is that good. So is the story line. I haven't found any episode that I find funny enough that I actually laughed out loud. The stories are not realistic and not funny and I guess that's pretty much it. There isn't a single thing I like about the series except for the character cece and it's just because I think she's very pretty and she has a nice body. and I am a girl! What I classify as a good comedy- or a comedy that deserves a rating above seven are how I Met your mother, friends, everybody loves Raymond, scrubs, but definitely not new girl. I'll give this series a 2/ 10 for the effort",2012

The characters are kind of lovable but this is so far from reality that it's not funny at all. Everything about this show is a bad and unfunny joke. Why?! All those unfunny stereotypes. Maybe this show is meant for 12 year olds in their puberty who know nothing about life because that is how the characters behave. They seem to know nothing about life, human interaction or anything you know as an adult what they clearly are judging on their appearance.",2015

I just can't watch her anymore, she is totally disingenuous.Her acting is artificial and she is not funny at all. Stop trying so hard! Please! I don't understand why everyone likes this show...it is tripe. I could get my neighbour's parakeet to write a better story. Id rather watch a 6 hour Tom Cruise monologue...strapped to the seat like in Clockwork Orange. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because I feel like some of the actors on the show are trying, and its not their fault that the writing and lead character blow.",2014

New girl are better to be a drama, not a comedy drama because it's full of drama and just a little comedy in it. i don't like new girl and i don't understand why people like it. is it because Zoey already famous for 500 days of summer and all other stuff? OK i like deschanel in 500 days of summer and others, but new girl is annoying and its aired so many times in my TV cable. please stop new girl for being so not funny. and for jess character it just don't work out. sorry for the fans but you must admit it's not funny.",2011
1,"That show is pretty bad... the concept is indeed very old but also approved and could work at least as a nice feel-good series (epecially with this lead-actress) if done right. But really this series doesn't feel good, it hurts. The show is all about sexual stereotypes and clichés. A young and hot and totally quirky ""girrl"" moves into a huge yuppie-flat together with 3 good looking shaped body homophobic male role models. She turns their live around by singing and being cute and doing totally crazy girlie stuff which only a very boring person (like her roommates) could find totally crazy. It seems like the 3 guys never got in contact with female characters before. Unless they are total nerds (which they are not - i think they hate nerds) or gay (which they are not - i think they hate gay people) they must be idiots. Besides of being pretty unrealistic all characters are really very stereotype plain stupid. Its the kind of characters you hate for being so dumb and shallow. I could not help but think ""wow, this is kind of sexist"" a couple of times while watching the pilot. Don't get me wrong: I am able to enjoy stupid feel-good sitcom series like ""Two and a half men"" but ""New girl"" is just not funny and likable.",2012
1,"This sitcom has also been played out many times before. It's been done, and overdone, and we are tired of seeing it. First, why would these three men need a roommate? Why would she move in with three strangers? Too contrived to be convincing. Zooey is cute, but she is exactly the same in every single thing she is in. I kept thinking of the movie Elf and that naiveté that was at once cute and annoying. Here it is more annoying than cute.",2011
10,Once Upon a Time already shows much potential with a great pilot episode. It really got to the point without giving everything away. It basically tells the background information behind the story seen in the shows fictional town of Storybrooke. It does this in just the right way so that the viewer won't get confused or bored from just hearing the talk of fairy-tales from the side of a little boy.,2011
2,"I am a storyteller who's been immersed in folklore, myth and fairy tales since boyhood. The collected tales of the Brothers Grimm, Alexandr Afanas'ev and others over the last 2 centuries are the way we convey the wisdom, beliefs and ethics of the past to the present. That said, I'm not a purist. The Grimms' tales had been revised many times to make them comport with the prevailing religions and mores of the tellers' changing times. I dearly love re-imagined classic material such as Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves (1984) or Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). The only versions of such tales that I truly despise are the Disney versions. Give me Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946) any day over the sickly sweet Disney version. That said, after a weak start, I tried with all my might to allow Once Upon a Time to grow on me.",2011
3,"The only way I can describe this show is meh. The premise seemed promising but before the end of the first season, it turned into a fairytale soap opera for 12 year olds. Some of the little subplots were entertaining, such as Ruby/Red being the wolf but this only lasted an episode or two. I was torn between clawing out my eyeballs and falling asleep during all of the Snow/Mary Margaret and Prince/David crap, and the whole thing about Regina/Queen and Emma fighting over Henry got old really fast. The one part of the show that was worthwhile was Rumpelstiltskin/Gold. His character was amazing and he was the only reason I watched as much as I did. Overall, it was pretty cheesy and random, but I am giving three stars for Rumpelstiltskin/Gold.",2014
3,I enjoyed the first 6 seasons immensely My Rating 10 but the current one no 7 is SOOO BAD!! My rating 3 :( Dania Ramirez looks old and like she is always in pain here we have a nearly 40 year of woman playing Hendry's Cinderella but looks more like his MOM probably double his age and looks it to :( and her acting is sub-par!! she should go back to Devious Maids where not much acting is required. I was looking forward to this now I'm just fast forwarding hoping this is a nightmare scene and we all go back to Storybrook with a Happy ending not the Disaster!!,2017
10,"I really enjoyed the pilot episode. It was refreshing to view a show that was not another reality series or ""dare"" show. This series brilliant mixture of classic fairy tales that adults have grown so familiar with and blended it with creative story lines. The acting was well done and the special effects were as well. The casting was well done and I couldn't imagine any other actor/actress playing the parts. Without giving too much away it's worth investing the hour to view! I can't wait to see the second episode and recommend this to any one who is/was a fan of Disney movies/Lost. Older children may even enjoy watching the series",2011
10,"Going into this show I wasn't quite sure what to expect seeing as how it was only partially laid out. However to my ever happy surprise this show is amazing, beautiful acting, terrific plot lines, and they weave it together so perfectly that you really just have to applaud the way its done.",2011
1,"I am so surprised, and wary, of all the positive reviews. Maybe it's one of those troll phenomenons where bad product gets critiqued highly or maybe it's all based on the first season. Anyways...",2014
5,"I really liked the first season or two of ""OUAT"", it was different than anything else on network TV, it was a cute concept, it was fun. Unfortunately, it's really gone downhill in the last few years and I think it's time for this fairy tale to reach ""The End."" ",2016
1,"OK, I quit. Having suffered through season three I won't even bother trying to watch season four. I program has gone from silly to just plain dumb in my opinion. The Blue Screen effects are poor, seen better Blue Screen on some weather maps, the acting for the most part is awful, the story has become boring and story lines that even include Medusa which would make me think the writers are either teenagers or can't tell the difference between a Fairy Tail and mythology. The only thing missing now is including Superman and Ben Hur. It seems that A.B.C is so desperate for a hit show they will just keep flogging this dead horse.",2013
2,"I used to look forward to watching this show. Now it's become so infantile, it's barely watchable. It's like someone at the top said, ""let's make this more for kids"", and they translated it to 'stupid kids'. Just as 'Once Upon A Time In Wonderland', the stupidity and childish nature of this show has pretty much done it in for me. Clearly the demographic that they're targeting is junior high school kids. Oh well. Goodbye Kitsis and Horowitz. I've enjoyed your creations before, but now they're simply banal. I guess you won't mind losing the intelligent portion of your audience, as long as you keeping setting your sights at the lowest common denominator.",2014
5,"I must admit I loved the beginning, but lately it has been extremely disappointing. I feel absolutely no progress in terms of the characters' evolution and every time I think something will actually happen - it is postponed at the end of the episode.",2012
3,"SPOILER ALERT: This series started out great. But each season has gotten worse. Each season has weirdly, catered more toward kids in special effects and story lines, while keeping adult themes present (like the romance angles). Season 1 was original and fun. Unlike others, I didn't mind the introduction of new season themes like TWOO, Frozen, King Arthur, and Hades. But the constant flashbacks and forwards are a stumbling process to say the least. ",2016
1,"CONTAINS SPOILERS: I'm writing this in regard to the show overall, and most of all because of the 4/18/16 episode, when the writers decided to throw in a lesbian plot line. For the record - I was pro-gay marriage before it was cool, and I have respect for everyone's rights. But - defying the subject and suitability - every show writer now thinks it's oh-so-cool to shove a lesbian sub-plot into a TV show, even if it sticks out like a sore thumb, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the characters, the subject of the show or it's style. ONCE is a show about fairy tale characters placed in the real world. It is about as suitable for a story about gay relationships as an episode of the Care Bears! Wrong subject, wrong theme, wrong plot, wrong characters, wrong style, wrong show. It's just bad art. And I am sick of people band wagoning onto gay subjects. If you want to make a show about gay issues, do so. You don't bring a specific subject like that up in the middle of a show which it has zero to do with. This is not a show about sexual orientation. So, don't bring in gay off-subject material. IT IS UNSUITABLE. And I am tired of the unsuitability. So, I changed my rating of this show to match it's writer's bad judgment. In any case - overall - the show has been getting more boring over the last 2 seasons, and the audience is painfully aware of that. That the writers would ""jump the shark"" and resort to a wild change of subject matter in a sad, obvious, desperate attempt to jazz up an increasingly declining show is just sad. And pathetic. And a major disappointment because I really looked forward to and respected this show up to season 3, and now, I'm just weary, and the straw that broke the camel's back is tonight's mis-application of gay issue subject matter. Tragic ""jumping the shark"" moment. I won't be watching anymore.",2016
4,"I want to start off by saying that I really wanted to like this show. However, by the 8th episode I realized that it was a big waste of time. I'm going to have to disagree with all of the other reviews comparing this series to Lost. For me, there is absolutely no comparison between the two. Even if the plot is interesting, most of the actors do not have the skills to pull it off. Jennifer Morrison (Emma Swan) gives an incredibly emotionless performance for someone who is abandoned as a child, and subsequently gives her own child away. Jared Gilmore (Henry Mills) tries, but I find their connection annoyingly lacking. With that said, I think Ginnifer Goodwin is pleasant in the role of Snow White. She was a good choice for this role, as she is accomplished as well as versatile. Goodwin gives off a sense of grace and purity essential for the character. The only other good part about this series is Robert Carlyle (Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin)he is creepy and believable in both roles with is important when the performance from Parilla (Regina Mills/Evil Queen) is laughable.",2012
10,"I saw an exclusive screening of the pilot at New York Comic Con and the show has a great start and a lot of potential. The plot and characters are well established during the pilot and by the end of the episode you're just thirsting for more! The episode consists of ""present day"" followed by back flash sequences in a very ""Lost"" fashion and it works well with this fairy tale genre. Just so you know what has been planned for the show, the writers at the NYCC panel said that further episodes will focus on the background of the characters. Tune in October 23 at 8PM for the pilot episode and support the beginnings of a great show on the ABC Network.",2011
9,"to be honest i hate all that fantasy crap, like harry potter, twilight, true blood, and i also hate all the shows that nbc and abc brings to the table. But the other night I was bored and a re run of this was on and I thought what the hell, I'll give it a try. This show is mind blowing. I am officially addicted. There are some questions I have, as the whole present time vs story time doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But the end of the first episode got me so insanely hooked. This show is definitely better than grimm. I don't know how there going to make seasons out of this show, but I am very excited to see. I gave it a 9 only because I am a bit confused on who some of the present time characters are. But besides that, amazing.",2011
10,"How refreshing to see a new show that isn't about courts, forensic science, lawyers or cops. I am keeping my fingers crossed this won't get the axe because it really is a cool twist on fairy tales. Your immediately drawn into this feeling of sympathy for the wicked queen who is scorned somehow (will find out more as the show goes on) by snow white and revenge is her only path. Then you go to a town where the cursed live and time has stopped. You slowly understand with flashbacks in time and why the queen did what she thought was her only path consequently a curse that has unknown origins at this time.",2011
10,Great cast and a very promising pilot. It captures the essence of a classic fairy tale and incorporates it with a modern setting where the real and the imaginary merges. ,2011
1,The latter part of season 1 of this TV series was shown as a mini-marathon over the New Year holiday. After seeing the trailers and missing the original showing I was all geared up for several hours of wonderful fantasy.,2012
1,"I watched the first three seasons and was borderline on the story. It was different and there was suspense. The characters were interesting. However I found that by the end of the 3rd season I had enough. The show was becoming a mishmash of cockamamie, convoluted crossover fest. It was boring to watch how traditional stories were being manipulated over and over again, just to fit some crazy script. I imagined that the writers would lock their selves in a room and smoking their cancer sticks and drinking coffee, they would try random wild combinations with the characters. There was no limit, there was no rules, no respect for any story or character. There were better shows and better ways to spend my free time, so I quit watching.",2017
4,This show started off great because it had mystery. It was so interesting to see each character unfold...,2016
2,"This series is so jaw-droppingly bad, my mind was boggled by the dribbling accolades of other viewers. Then I saw a review that said something like, ""If you were a fan of ""Lost"" just stay tuned! You'll LOVE it!!!!"" (I may have left out a ! or two.) Of course, that reviewer was absolutely right. I've watched maybe a half dozen episodes, and the writers have changed the paradigm at least four times. That is, they used the now-famous ""Lost"" principle of fantasy writing: if you introduce enough confusing minor side plots, oddly compelling but ultimately pointless minor characters, ersatz ""mysteries"" and alarming character about-faces that have the main actors alternately weeping for their lost innocence and true loves and then ripping out and eating the raw hearts of infants - well then by gum, this is the show for you! But- and I do absolutely and personally guarantee this- you will NEVER see anything like a real plot resolution, because the writers and producers plan to throw so many complications into the mix that they think, and past experience has shown, that the fans are too dim to remember more than a few of the most glamorous or grisly, so however they end it, no one will care, and few will notice that in any way that matters, the whole thing just stunk on ice.",2012
1,Have you guys ever seen the movie Birdemic? Because this is the series version,2015
7,"This movie was all things cliché and predictable. Even though you know what is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human behavior was incredibly well done. ",2011
8,I was able to see a sneak screening of this movie almost 1 month prior to it's official release. I honestly walked in simply thinking I was seeing another typical romantic comedy with my girlfriend. To my surprise it was much more.,2011
8,I was expecting to have to compare this movie with No Strings Attached (or whatever that movie with Ashton Kutcher was) all the way through however I was pleasantly surprised that the story was a bit more complex despite the obvious parallels.,2011
7,"""Friends with Benefits"" has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com storyline and its ending is pretty lame. Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, ""Friends with Benefits,"" Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So ""Friends with Benefits"" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two well-craft parts.",2012
7,"I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.",2011
6,Watch this if...you are in the mood for an adult-oriented romantic comedy that has a great pace and manages to appeal to both genders.,2011
2,"This movie is just...ugh. I got halfway through it and realized that I literally did not care what happened at all. I wouldn't have cared if one of them was hit by a truck and died, that was the result of unconvincing characters who just sound like their spewing out bad jokes from their memorised script. This movie didn't even have the bright side of good actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis may be easy on the eye but are mediocre actors at best, you only have to watch MK in Oz: The Great And Powerful to see what I mean. It's just so boring and predictable and as the movie goes on it gets more and more cheesy. The plot is so unbelievably cliché that you only have to read the description on the back to know what's going to happen.",2013
1,"Aight, the picture itself is not too bad. It's clichéd, shallow, crude, predictable. It's replete with impossibly talented non-entities cracking wise left and right. Both women and men, gay and straight, are portrayed as annoying jerks, without any old-school values or integrity. If the human race ever devolves to the specimens as depicted in this movie, I'm getting a one-way ticket off the planet.",2012
1,"I don't know what I expected from this packaged pre-frabricated Hollywood blockbuster so why did I feel like I wasted my $1.29 at Redbox (actually twice that for accidentally keeping the movie 2 nights). From the beginning, the dialogue was so full of quips and witty banter that the characters were never believable. The plot is basically the writer living out a fantasy of ""no strings attached"" sex which is a joke in real life because it's not how humans are made. In the movie, instead of learning that ""no love sex"" is impossible, the characters just decide they really do like each other (I'm not even going dilute the word ""love"" by using it here). The movie then proceeds to predictably fall into the romantic comedy trap that it made fun of in the beginning. Beside many personal annoyances (like Hollywood producers & writers always making movies about or based in New York or L.A. because they are ignorant as to any kind of life outside of those cities), I am beyond sick of movies diluting the beauty of sex by pushing the boundaries and tiptoeing on the line of pornography. This movie offers nothing more than the eye candy of Mila Kunis. If I were you I would not waste a Redbox dollar on it.",2012
1,Spoilers ahead!,2011
1,"Friends with Benefits seems like it might be a satire of Nora Ehpron's feel good films,or Neil Simon's one dimensional types with just TV cracks as substitutes for any kind of genuine dialogue. Not the case here. This film makes Ephron's screenplays and directed films, along with N. Simon's stuff, look like classics. Friends with Benefits has no acting in it, except for Patricia Clarkson, and she is debased as one of those old women- mothers who swear and screw around with men etc.",2011
2,"This is the movie for the video generation - all flash mobs and photography. Some very good actors (Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, and Richard Jenkins) do their best with clichéd caricature actors (the shrewish ex-girlfriend, the lost-in-the-70's mom; and the father with Alzheimiers with a propensity for taking his pants off. Only Jenna Elfman as Timberlake's sister comes off as an actual human being. Woody Harrelson is horribly one-note as the obsessively gay sports Editor but it's okay because he's hip. This movie tries to be as hip as it can be by pretending to be a spoof on Hollywood Romantic comedies while actually making one. But, it's not really a romantic comedy at all despite the tacked-on cliché ending. It's really vulgar.",2011
1,"I saw the advert for this on TV and thought that this could have potential to watch with my girlfriend so we went to see it. Ohh how i was wrong, i can honestly say i can't think of a worse film i have seen all year. The acting was terrible the storyline was predictable the editing was shocking too.",2011
5,"If you had read my comments you know my hatred for most romantic comedies, as they are the same formula over and over again with different names and actors. 2011 had a movie staring hot on the rise Natalie Portman called No Strings Attached. An intelligent romantic comedy about the realism on relationships, how sometimes there is no way to get around having feelings for someone in our busy world. We want that connection with someone and sometimes let it go before we realize that we may have lost someone special. So almost in taking her role too seriously, Mila Kunis who starred with Natalie Portman in Black Swan playing a girl who is almost a little jealous of the lead's talent, takes on the same like role. Playing the girl a small bit different by being someone who does believe in love but thinks that it's something wrong with her on why she can't find the right guy for her. Can Justin Timberlake prove her wrong? What could have been a very creative formula in making fun of how romantic comedies have taken over most women's perceptions of what love should be instead of what's reality, it turns back into the same tired old formula it's bashing in the first place.",2012
4,I have been a member on IMDb for almost 10 years and never wrote a review. This film made me so shocked that I came here just tow write this review.,2011
7,"So is Friends With Benefits better than No Strings Attached? Yes. And if that's all you needed to settle a bet with your friend, you can go call him up now and plan a trip to the theater July 22 to find out why.",2011
2,"I was staying in on Saturday night and wanted to watch something light hearted and humorous. Friends with benefits seemed the perfect fit. Mila Kunis is usually talented and Justin Timberlake has done some good stuff. Add to it the glamour of NY and sharp comedy, things looked promising.",2013
2,"I was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin Timberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally better than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and co-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the direction. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to the film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an excellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively. The film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy project in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one.",2011
2,"The thing about 'Friends with Benefits"" is that you have, in fact, seen it before. Not in the generic way the film implies that all romantic comedies are the same. But this exact movie was released earlier this year with the title ""No Strings Attached"". And what's worse is that vapid, uninspired, Hollywood-love-fest original is actually better.",2011
7,"Friends with Benefits is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I thought this would be exactly like No Strings Attached,and I really hated that movie so I wasn't going to bother watching this,but my friends told me it was much different and better,and while I didn't believe them I gave this a chance and I'm happy I did,it is much better and it isn't similar at all to No Strings Attached other than the set up of two friends having casual relations.I cared about these characters a lot and wanted them to get together,there was really great chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake,and there are also hilarious cameos from great comedy actors such as Woody Harrelson,Andy Samberg.Emma Stone,Rashida Jones,Jason Segel,among others.My favourite part of the movie was Richard Jenkins,he delivered a great performance and the emotional addition of him struggling with Alzheimer's was a good idea and very sweet,I cared about him more than anyone else.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's funny and certainly a better than usual romantic comedy that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good one.

1,"OK, what you see from the beginning to end is a display of Sony products.",2012
3,"This movie was absolutely horrendous. There was not a single positive aspect to this movie. First of all, it's not funny. Second of all, the acting is lousy. I understand that this is a romantic comedy and it's supposed to be a bit light and not so deep...but this was really bad. I mean, there really wasn't a single truthful moment in this movie from an acting perspective. I've seen children have more substance that Justin Timberlake and his female counterpart. Third of all, this movie was really awkward- like neither of these individuals have had sex in their life..... Fourth, the plot/story is literally non-existent--> we are literally forced to watch the first hour of the movie in this sort of trance-like mirage of weird images of Justin trying to be funny in bed with this chick....but all the audience could do is cringe in utter embarrassment at this fiasco.",2012
7,"Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film. It is definitely not an awful film, like most critics are saying. I think critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X-Men: First Class. They should not compare the Green Lantern with those films. It is ranked now 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is way too low. It would probably be in the high 60s, if it was released before Thor and X-Men: First Class.",2011
6,"As someone who's followed Green Lantern a little bit of a decent amount (not big but fairly decent, for DC character), I liked some things about the movie; but I definitely say that it could have been made better, both for casual fans, non-GL fans or hard core ones.",2011
10,"I know a lot of people didn't like Green Lantern but I don't know why. It was a fun movie with a good solid lead in Ryan Reynolds. It was not as dark as The Dark Knight or V For Vendetta but that is not the nature of Green Lantern. The special effects were good and the casting was fine. Tim Robbins was well cast as Hammond as was Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond. Kudos to Mark Strong as Sinestro. I do hope they do a sequel with him as Sinestro was one of my favourite villains. All up it was a solid film and one I enjoyed immensely. Pity some people were disappointed but to be honest, I don't know what they were expecting as the film stayed reasonably true to the character and the tone of the comic books.",2012
5,"I went to see Green Lantern because a friend of mine was boycotting DC for such a long time because there has been no release of a Green Lantern movie.

7,"In 1938, comic Imigination arrived at Dectective Comics with the Introducted of the Dark Knight also called The Batman. Before long a plethora of others soon followed, among them was the mysterious "" Green Lantern. "" Hal Jordan AKA Green Lantern are both played by Ryan Reynold.

That, then is the primary ingredient for his selection and the gist of the legend. Once you enter the myth of the Green Lantern, you also enter the vast din of the Universe and it's mystical powers, where beings from other planets are collected to fight their Nemesis, . . . Fear. This film does it's best to take our Hero and the audience to their world and the battlefield of the Universe.

7,"Look, you don't come to a film like this expecting Citizen Kane. This was a great popcorn flick.

2,"For a comic book movie, Green Lantern had the potential to be great. If the writers of the movie even watched the animated movie First Flight, they would've been able to come up with a better script than what they did. I think the cast did the best that they could with the corny lines and terrible writing.",2011
7,"Another in a long line of comic book films released this year, Green Lantern unfortunately doesn't compare to Thor, X-Men: First Class or Captain America. Had I seen Green Lantern *before* seeing those other three films, perhaps I wouldn't be as critical of it. But those previous movies set a high standard that this latest comic book movie doesn't quite reach. I feel a large part of why GL isn't as successful as the films before it is the pace and editing. A film about aliens, space police and a ring that can transform thought into reality should all come together to make one hell of an interesting film, but somehow the movie suffers from a seemingly sluggish pace in the beginning (thanks to a rather snore-worthy voice-over, explaining things that we need to know) before anything really interesting happens. Starting movies with prologues/exposition *can* be interesting, but this one manages to make everything that *should* be interesting somehow dull. It's actually very disappointing, given that director Martin Campbell was behind two of the best Bond movies ever (Goldeneye and Casino Royale). Those films never had a dull moment in them, whereas GL seems to have too many.",2011
5,"We are getting decent and compelling superhero movies these days, which is a great thing that happened to the genre. Now ""Green Lantern"" is one of those films that also needs to be powerful, but it ends up being a generic cheesy cinema.

10,"This film is a highly underrated masterpiece, fast paced, fun and true to the comic. The cast is almost right, though they should have used somebody more serious for the lead than Ryan Reynolds, Sam Worthington perhaps. Blake Lively makes a sexy helpless heroine and Peter Sarsgaard does a fine job as a creepy bad guy, albeit one covered in makeup. All in all this deserves to be up there with Superman II, Dark Knight and the first two Spidermans. I really do hope they'll ignore the critics and box office revenue to make a second one, as I feel one of the reasons its flopped is because many people who have watched it had never read the comic beforehand, meaning it was harder to pick up some parts of the plot.",2011

When Sam Raimi told a super hero story with the same structure in 2002, there was still plenty it added a new filter.

6,"They say that if you've seen one superhero movie, you've seen them all. That's not entirely true, but if every superhero movie were like Green Lantern, then it would be true. Green Lantern is your typical superhero movie, so if you've seen quite a few superhero movies (like I have), you'll know what's ahead. This is the problem with Green Lantern, it's too predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the crowd. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, but it's not a good thing either. There are 3 good things in this movie. One, Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch. Two, the SFX are cool and what they do with the Green Lantern ring is also cool, and Parallax's design suits its evilness. Third, the fight between Hal and Parallax is the best scene in the movie. Other than those things, it's average. If you've never seen a superhero movie and/or are a Green Lantern fan, this movie is worth seeing. Everyone else should see X-Men: First Class.",2011
1,"I'm of a forgiving nature, especially when it comes to sci-fi, special effects driven, blockbuster movies. I enjoyed the Star Wars prequels, i even enjoyed the last Indy movie, i gave G.I Joe a decent review....G.I Joe, yeah, that G.I Joe.",2011
1,"This film was terrible. I could not believe they've picked Ryan Reynolds to play Green Lantern, he belongs in rom-coms. And that is what he almost turned this into, the comedy played far too big a part in this. What little faith I had in Reynolds as playing this role was shattered very quickly, he simply is not made for serious movies. Though this film isn't exactly serious, it isn't exactly a comedy either.",2011
10,"First, I see that this movie has been getting negative reviews. However, it is the first superhero movie of its type. As an avid green lantern fan, I have to say that it does exactly what it should do, set-up the character.",2011
8,"I enjoyed this movie, it was not bad, and despite all the criticism I really liked it. If you go in giving it a chance and just looking to enjoy it, you just might. It's a bit harder to get into than the usual hero movies, but other than that the only fault might be that it was a bit ambitious. It's kind of a strange story for those not familiar with green lantern , but give it a shot.",2012
8,"Multiple people have compared this to Neeson's 2008 release of ""Taken."" Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him.

There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out. ",2011
7,"I guess if you really want to put an American in a harsh situation, have him lose his memory in a foreign country. For Americans that's probably the closest thing to Hell on Earth, right up there with being denied Monday Night Football in Hi-Def. (Just kidding) A few films have similar premises of an American being a fish out of his own waters: ""the Bourne Identity"", ""Frantic"", and ""Seven Days Seven Nights"". Hollywood is also replete with stories about people either losing their memories or simply being ""lost"" inside a political situation because of forces beyond their control, such as ""the Changeling"", Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"", ""the Truman Show""; even ""Total Recall"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" have similarities.",2011
7,"The movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality, once reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in ""Unknown"" the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies. The result is an entertaining, involving pic, never losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying attached to the screen till the end. Set in a depressing Berlin covered by snow, always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past, a good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the story and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much incomprehensible as much needing some resolution, and an effective final twist as well. Liam Neeson plays skillfully, although not always sufficiently expressive, he gets to convey the sense of void of someone looking for some identity. A stand-out performance is offered by Bruno Ganz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the ticket.",2011
8,"Liam Neeson is turning into quite an action star these days despite his advancing age. After starring in the surprise action hit Taken, Liam tries his hand at another similar movie except with a much fewer body count. Unknown is a crafty little thriller set in international lands and is much better than I expected it to be. I thought this would be almost like a sequel to Taken but what I got was a tense, smartly-written thriller.",2013
8,"An effective thriller with a good twist in the ending. Not since The Sixth Sense has a movie given me such a surprise at its ending. Liam Nieson keeps your attention fixed on the action throughout the movie, although some of his lines did not match the scenes or his character. If someone is trying to kill you, maybe some emotion would be shown. The car accident at the beginning is very realistic and makes Liams amnesia credible. The car chase scenes in the movie will also keep the action buffs happy, although the black car driven by the assassin is a bit too corny to believe . Bruno Ganz as an aging former Stasi agent gives a stand-out performance and Diane Kruger supports Nieson without the usual Hollywood theme of girl following for hero. Maybe its because Nieson is old enough to be her father. This film is no masterpiece but if your looking for a couple of hours entertainment with an interesting ending this will fit the bill.",2011

6,"This movie would have felt more original before Jason Bourne hit the screen, but we already have one black-op operative with amnesia out there. I truly wonder if anyone mentioned the similarities when this being proposed. Granted, there is a good plot twist when he is told who and what he is, but smart people would have noticed something wrong when he drives like a professional, and fights as if he'd been trained to. Just like Bourne. I did not find very many original concepts in this movie, and once I make the comparison to JB (sorry, I mean Bourne, not James Bond or Jack Bauer ... JB is just a good set of initials for this sort of thing I guess!) - I kept thinking that there was more ingenuity in the Bourne movies, and a lot more investment in character development. This movie is watchable. ... Barely. And I have no desire to watch it again.",2011

8,"This century has seen Liam Neeson in real leading roles, when his character ""permeates"" the whole movie and is strong and quick-witted. Taken 1 and 2 are best known, Unknown has - for some reason or another - remained in their shadow. In my opinion, the script of the latter is much stronger, has more twists-turns and unpredictable moments - me being a fan and active viewer of crime thrillers could not guess what kind of background could Neeson's character Dr. Martin Harris really have. Sequence of the events is logical and chases are visually enjoyable. The ending in general is predictable, apart from the very last scene.",2012

3,I guess anyone deprived of his identity would feel shocked and be willing to do anything to get his life back. In Unknown there is a lot of passivity all around from Martin Harris (Liam Neeson). I do not know if the book was better at this but on the big screen you spend more time waiting with the protagonist than watching him actually fighting to solve the issue.,2014
4,Warning there might be some spoilers ahead. I haven't seen a movie in just about two months since Tron Legacy. There wasn't anything that interested me until UNKNOWN. It looked like it would be a good action/suspense movie but I was wrong. I'll be blunt this movie was pretty boring. It's kind of reminds me of The American with George Clooney. It had potential but failed to rise above ordinary to bad.,2011
1,"One of the most embarrassing, painful and boring movies within the last decade. Zero suspense. Awful script. Talking heads with dialogue making no sense at all (Gretchen: He's finding people). It starts with the question: how can a super-killer-agent be stupid enough to forget his suitcase at the airport? and it ends with the question: how can a director and his producers be brainless enough to expect that people haven't seen Total Recall and Bourne Identity to make this movie as predictable as a Mickey-Mouse-comic. Don't believe whatever good reviews you might have read. You'll want your money back after having wasted the first ten minutes with this terrible mistake.",2011
1,"A good suspense film is supposed to keep to you guessing till the end. And when the explanation comes, you're supposed to remember several clues and go ""Ohhhhhh. I can't believe I didn't notice that"", as was done very well in The Sixth Sense. Unknown failed on both counts.",2011
1,"An average story with some limited potential, but ruined by Liam Neeson's wooden acting, and ruined even more by some ridiculous script and plot elements.

I don't want to totally spoil the plot in case you still decide to watch this film, but let me give you three examples:",2011
2,"First off...why all the comparisons to Taken? Sure, Neesom plays a guy with a scary skill set in both movies...so what? In Taken, he's fully aware of his skills and sets about using them to secure his abducted daughter's safety.

8,"Considering all the garbage movie critics have to sit through in a year, it's pretty amazing when a film that's smarter than most hits theaters and makes a bit of an impact. Independent films are one thing, but major ones released by bigger studios are even a bigger deal when this occurs. I think that's one of the reasons Inception was so great. Creativity and intelligence are two things that are usually lacking from blockbusters. The Adjustment Bureau is a film that has a bit more to it than you're probably expecting. Based on ""The Adjustment Group,"" a short story by Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report), The Adjustment Bureau has probably already caught your attention either because you're a fan of Dick's work and/or the movies that were adapted from it.",2011

5,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" is preposterous, and before you counter with ""Well, duh, it's science fiction,"" allow me to elaborate. I'm down with the premise that mankind is safeguarded by an invisible shadow organization that dictates the paths we follow and the decisions we make— what baffles me is that they achieve these means through (spoiler alert?) magic hats. I wish I were joking. The single biggest misstep in this bungled Philip K. Dick adaptation is that the mystique of our antagonists is dispelled almost instantaneously. We get to know our aggressors who, as it turns out, are anything but aggressive. To compare genres, there's never been a great thriller where the detective in pursuit of a killer is 'just doing their job.' Passion breeds compelling cinema, and the paper pushers at the heart of ""The Adjustment Bureau"" are supremely uninteresting.",2011
10,I was invited today to see an Advance Screening of this movie by a a friend and was excited to find out it was this movie. I had seen the preview during the commercial break from one of my TV shows that I follow and it seemed promising.,2011
9,"The Adjustment Bureau, written and directed by George Nolfi based on a  short story by the name of Adjustment Team by Philip K. Dick, is about  how much one would be willing to sacrifice in the name of love. Matt  Damon plays David Norris, a young, ambitious, idealistic Congressman  seeking election for a seat in the Senate. However, upon a short  encounter with Elise (Emily Blunt), when they share a brief but  meaningful kiss, David realizes his true love lies with Elise, not at  the hands of registered voters of New York City. The adjustment bureau  quickly notices the spark, and was determined to separate the two  lovers because according to ""the plan"", their love was never meant to  be. David, however, refuses to back down, and fights against his fate  to be with the one he loves.  What makes The Adjustment Bureau a truly great movie is that it sends a  powerful message: don't be afraid to go after what you want. Even if it  means going against the will of a powerful, if not divine being. The  movie makes it no secret that ""the chairman"" is a symbolism for God,  and the people of the adjustment bureau are His angels (""we've been  called that (angels)"", says Harry Mitchell, a member of the adjustment  bureau in one scene). However, in the film, even God is not all  powerful, as He only has limited enforcers in the adjustment bureau, so  if a nuclear warfare were to break out, even He could not prevent the  catastrophe that would follow.  The film also makes a strong case that free will does take its toll. As  Thomson, another adjustment bureau member reminds us in another scene,  that although ""the chairman"" has blessed us with the gifts of intellect  and reason, it was those same gifts that caused the world to be on the  brink of destruction during the Cuban missile crisis. To add additional  pressure for David to keep away from Elise, Thomson informs David that  if he chooses to be with her, not only will it ruin his dream, but will  also ruin her dream (she is fated to be a famous dancer, and then a  famous choreographer). As if to add insult to injury, Thomson flexes  his muscle, causing Elise to sprain her ankle, then telling David that  he is the one to blame for her injury.  After a few twists and turns, the film reaches its climax with a  showdown between David and the Thomson, which was very exciting and  kept me on the edge of my seat (as did all other parts of the movie), I  have to admit that the resolution was a bit of a cop out (I won't ruin  it for you). In fact, if the movie had a resolution that was as epic as  the rest of the storyline, I would not hesitate to give it 10/10 stars.  Unfortunately, the ending did disappoint me a great deal, so as it  stands, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As a final note, I would like to say that you were planning on watching  this movie at all, you almost certainly should see it in the theater.  Director George Nolfi (FYI, this is his first movie as director)  incorporates beautiful cinematography, as well as great sound mixing  (or is it sound editing? I'm not sure). I especially loved the clicking  noise of the dressing shoes of Thomson and his enforcers against the  tile floor as they chase down David to set him on his ""correct"" path.  The noise was complimented by their perfect formation, as they all send  a clear message: we are the ones in charge, and we WILL hunt you down.",2011
7,"In New York, the prominent politician David Norris (Matt Damon) is disputing the election for the Senate but his past of bad boy makes him lose the election. He meets the stranger Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) hidden in the Waldorf's toilet and she tells that she had crashed a party and the security guards are chasing her. They start a conversation and they immediately fall in love with each other. However the guards find her and David does not see her again. However she inspires him to make a remarkable speech.

1,"stupid, stupid movie, we have a group of people that include the Chairman (God)and the men (no women here) who make thing go according to plan (the angels). The single purpose of this group is to keep two people apart. To assist them in their undertaking they have their godlike supernatural abilities whereas the two people are just ordinary Americans. Amazingly enough we find that God and his angels are no match for two Americans and so the two people cannot be kept apart. Now it seems that God doesn't care to be thwarted so he or she decides to change the plan so that it is no longer necessary to keep them apart thus ensuring that everything still goes according to plan (the new plan). This change of heart seems to have something to do with a lower level angel although we are not sure how this comes about. This plot is quite ridiculous and an insult to peoples intelligence. It's even worse than the Bourne movies. I guess Mr Damon will do anything for a buck.",2011
7,"Fate, coincidence and free will come at odds with one another in this sci-fi romance re-imagined by George Nolfi from the short story, ""Adjustment Team"", by sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. Nolfi's plot can go from interesting and intriguing to downright silly at times but the main attraction is not the narrative. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC.",2011
5,"Those who have seen the trailer will think that this is a cool, exciting action film about men who control the destinies of others and the man who says, ""I will not stand for this!"" but sadly that is not the story of the film. The concept is great and there are moments where I thought the film was going to get better because the story sounds interesting. ",2011
3,"There are many movies with impossible plots that are entertaining because you are carried along by the story. You don't notice the holes in the plot until the next day. In this case, the plot is not merely preposterous, it is transparent. As such, it is impossible to enjoy the movie because you are sitting in the theatre analyzing its faults. Let's begin with the idea that Matt Damon looks for his true love for 3 years after their chance meeting. O.K., so I didn't realize until the next day that his true love had crashed a wedding and that she was last seen being chased by security people much faster than she was. Matt could simply have checked back at the hotel to learn her identity. But even while I was watching the movie it was obvious that he plays a well-known public figure. So why didn't she just call him up? Once you realize this is all she would have to do, the premise of the movie collapses. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, the human hero is outwitting God. How believable is that? The angels suggest that God just doesn't have the resources to monitor everybody, so He focuses on ""important"" people. That's simply annoying. This is a God who (rather than knowing when any sparrow falls) apparently only knows when a condor falls. And then you have the angel who violates God's orders to help our hero find his true love by loaning him his cheesy hat. I could only think of the Red Hat Ladies. Where do they end up when they go though a door? I've never read (or heard of) the scifi novel from the 50's that this is based on, but I recognized the genre when it was postulated that all the large events of Western Civilization could be explained by times that God intervened and times when God took a hands-off approach: God was on-duty up to the Fall of Rome, but took the day off during the Dark Ages, etc. Other reviewers quibble that this ignores other cultures, but 1950's scifi was into sweeping concepts like this. Frankly, it is kinda neat, and as a teenager I would have been intrigued. But the problem here is that Hollywood has taken what was probably a pretty good idea from the 50's and trashed it. I'd bet that the author made a much more credible case for his premise and tied up the loose ends in a way that was internally consistent. Not so here. I give three stars because of the scenes of New York and because smoking was not prominently featured. Even Big Tobacco passed on this turkey.",2011
1,"I watched this film with my family and we all agreed at the end, that we should have left when we first thought of it only 15 minutes into it.",2011
2,"I saw this at a preview screening. The premise of mysterious strangers controlling our destiny comes from the eccentric imagination of Phillip K. Dick; everything else in the movie is cookie cutter Hollywood fluff. None of the characters are remotely believable either in their everyday lives or in the nonchalant reactions to learning mind bending secrets about themselves and human destiny. What could have been an entertaining and creepy paranoid fantasy instead becomes a by the numbers sermon on the power of ""true love"" (which seems to refer to the infatuation you experience after spending a few hours engaging in cute banter and rolling in the hay with a virtual stranger). Has a number of unintentional laughs, not the least of which involves a character recounting a skewed history of the human race that ignores everything outside of Western Europe and America. Beyond all the silliness and the immaturity of the script, however, what really surprised me was how lazy it all felt. The performances were lackluster, the tense scenes were boring, the love story was passionless, the fantasy elements pedestrian. Towards the end I thought we might be at least being heading toward something really outrageous, but even that turned out to be a false hope.",2011
1,"I have been a ""warmish' Matt Damon fan. Some of his work hasn't been too bad. But this shocker- what was he thinking? When the first incident through the magic door took place I thought we were in for a bit of thuggery -a.k.a- ""thriller' even though the protagonists were wearing overcoats, scarves and 1960 hats. But no, just some odd looking people in motor bike helmets who pushed our hero David back into a chair and that was it. The plot was so thin I half expected to see a smoke machine adding a bit of mystery. And the script... words fail me. I must say the collision gave me a jolt, and by the reaction in the cinema I wasn't the only one drifting off with boredom. The movie looked like an adult take on Narnia and the trip through the wardrobe. At least in that movie the costumes and scenery made it worth watching.",2011
4,"I honestly had extremely high expectations for this movie from what the movie trailer was portraying. However after I watched the movie I was sorely disappointed. In my opinion it should have been about how ""The Bureau"" was controlling everyones moves and actions uncovering their every single move into their lives.

He doesn't expect to see her again but some time later he bumps into her on a New York bus, this time he gets her name (Elise) and number.

8,"I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven's managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that's a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right. Honestly speaking, there aren't too many surprises to be had in Scream 4. No matter how mordantly self-aware the movies are (and believe me, Scream 4 gets a little tediously indulgent in its postmodern cleverness), there's an inevitable predictability to some of the proceedings but anybody who's a genre-savvy horror fan will appreciate how brilliantly everything is executed. The opening sequences, for example, are one of the best parts of the movie and are a perfect reintroduction to the franchise and while the bulk of the story lags a little, it's redeemed by the ballsy ending.",2011
7,"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE: READ ON FOR MY REVIEW ON SCREAM 4 (2011) I was pleasantly surprised. This was a great movie, especially for fans of the original. It makes up for the awfulness of Scream 3, and includes many very talented new actors and actresses. I was very surprised to walk into the screening theater and see a fantastic horror film. As soon as the Dimension logo appeared on screen, my heart began to race. The opening scene was brutal and hilarious, and it was great to see all of the original characters back on the screen again. I found the Wes Craven cameo, and was laughing as I spotted it out. This movie was great to watch, even though there were some things that needed to be fixed. Very minor problems though. There were some parts in the dialogue that seemed unrealistic (Ehren Kruger re-writes), but it wasn't a huge deal. Also, the ending was kinda long, but it was also very suspenseful. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend in search of a good horror movie.",2011

The movie had great suspense with intense twists and turns. This movie will take you through all kinds of emotions. You'll laugh. You'll cringe. You'll jump out of your seat. Everything. There is one scene in particular that will probably give you nightmares for a while. The cast was awesome. A great blend of young future stars and seasoned veterans. Kudos to Wes Craven and everybody involved with this movie for doing such a good job. I really liked this movie and I think that you'll like it too. I highly recommend this movie.",2011
10,"Scream 4 should have been terrible - after all, Scream 2 was only ""ok"" and Scream 3 was a disaster. But Scream 4 is a very good movie, both as part of the franchise, but also as a stand alone.",2011

8,"Back in 1996, the first Wes Craven movie from the Scream franchise ended, or should i say, began a whole new generation of horror movies.The suspense became bigger than before, and the hackneyed stories of torture, abandoned roads and stokers came to a relative end.The new-age horror began back then-a nice mix of humor, suspense, jump-scenes, blood and gore..and of course, the merge of some typical killer profiles in one.The result-Ghostface.So many movies have been made as a parody of the notorious killer and some of them have succeeded with it.But only one movie will come in mind when we speak of Ghostface- the Scream franchise.And this one sticks to everything we wanted.",2011
9,"Never before have I seen a horror franchise spawn 4 movies and still be taken seriously, usually when a franchise follows this path it means that the producers are making annual cash-ins trying to milk the franchise as much as possible while it is still popular and relevant (see Saw, Final Destination), well for Scream 4 (or Scre4m)that's not the case, this movie makes an effort to continue a saga which was put to sleep for more than a decade, without it being a re-imagining, re-make or re-boot like the hideous Rob Zombie attempt at a Halloween remake(although the movie makes fun of this in a brilliant way). Scream 4 is more than that, while a sequel, it feels like a complete new beginning, it carried the bad stigma that the failed Scream 3 left behind, yet it proved that the series is still relevant, and with the adequate script it takes off on a delightful new killing spree.",2011
9,To the younger generations of movie reviewers: Take the stick out of your ass before watching this movie! Thank you.,2011
8,"This is much better then most horror sequels. This film has moments that ""Scream"" fans will get a huge kick out of. The story does go a little too crazy however at the end. It does perform as an excellent chapter in the ""Scream Series"". If you have never seen a ""Scream"" film that is okay. This film works on its own and you do not have too know anything of the previous films.",2017
10,"It has been too long since Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed up to deliver the goods what with Craven concentrating on his rehash of remakes and Williamson penning the likes of the Vampire Diaries. It has also been too long since a good ""Scream"" movie hit theatres, after the dreadful Scream 3 passed by in a whimsical, so you can imagine my horror when Dimension announced they were reviving the sequel and adding a fourth movie on the end. Not only did I feel that the Scream franchise belonged soley to the 90's (and thus it avoided the campy 80's slash era and the 2000's torture gorn obsession) I also wondered how on earth would they pull it off, after more than ten years since the last intalment.

8,"It's a rare occurrence in the horror genre where a sequel can be better or just as good as the original. Scream 4 is 1 of the few exceptions i think that exists. This sequel is just as good as the original but double the scares and double the ghost face killings. Its also good to see Neve,David and Courtney back together again after so many years apart and also Wes craven as the horror director. Plus seeing new faces like Emma Roberts or Hayden Panetierre was a nice touch to the franchise. ",2011
7,"First of all I love the original Trilogy of Scream and when I heard that they were making a fourth one and perhaps even a new trilogy I got extremely excited! I literally came on IMDb everyday to check up on news reports and clips for the move and was ecstatic when the first trailer appeared! I ran to the theater once I was able to go and see it and was all jittery with excitement and disbelief that I was actually FINALLY going to see the new movie. I know what you're thinking is he 5 or something? No I'm just a big fan of scream... I was like 4 when the first scream came out though... But anyways once the credits hit I felt very disappointed by how everything turned out. So I made a list as to what I didn't like about the movie - The worst opener in the scream series. The original trilogy was so tragic how the characters died, Casey Becker gets killed by ghost face and her parents were so close to saving her, Maureen gets killed in a movie theater filled with people who could have helped her but they all thought it was a publicity stunt, and Cotton Weary tried desperately to save his girlfriend who attacks him because she was manipulated into thinking he was trying to kill her and eventually they both get killed. This beginning was more comedic and tried to have lots of twists unfortunately it was not surprising since when the girls were killed there acting suddenly became really fake and the killer moved at super speed... I knew it was going to end up being a stab movie and it was stab 6; I remember craven said they're on stab 7 so I knew the next sequence was also a stab movie. then finally we came to the real world and we see these two girls (jenny and Marnie) talking about the stab movies and then jenny decides to play a prank by pretending she's ghost face on the phone but then Marnie gets killed (which you don't see happen) and jenny suddenly gets the call and eventually she gets killed herself. -Another thing I had a problem with was how the story developed, everything was happening really fast and there were no real character development or mystery to it. It was more like ""hmm I wonder who's killing everyone"" and BAM people dropping like flies everywhere. One thing that seemed awkward to me was that NONE of the new cast members, besides Deputy Judy, lived. Which you didn't really care about since none of the characters was developed besides Kirby who I loved but saw her death coming from a mile away (which also led to the reveal of the first killer). The other characters I liked were Rebecca who was really fun to watch but she was really stupid (why didn't she call the cops while she was locked in the car?), and Robbie because he could have easily become Randy 2.0. I also liked detective Hoss but only because he was played by Adam Brody. -Another problem was the deaths, they weren't creative AT ALL!! The only death I liked watching was Olivia's death because it was the longest and most violent which really made the film appear like it was trying to show how horror is now a days with all the super violence. All the other deaths were basically just a stab to the back or torso and one really dumb stab to the forehead (he should have died automatically) I mean seriously Hoss gets stabbed in the back and dies instantly but Perkins gets stabbed in the forehead and still manages to say a one-liner!?? Also where is all the cat-mouse chase scene? There was like one that was sort of a chase scene involving Rebecca in a parking garage. oh BTW when people died in this movie the characters literally reacted for 2 seconds then moved on like nothing happened! Are these people heartless? -My last complaint was the killers and their motives. It was pretty obvious that Charlie was one of the killers because he was the only one that wasn't automatically killed by ghost face. He was tied up so that Kirby had to answer some horror movie questions and, for the first time ever, got the last question right only for her to untie him and get stabbed. Then Jill was the other killer, obviously since she was the only character who was still alive and who never got a red herring on her, and she kills Charlie and reveals that she wants to be Sidney 2.0 because she wants to be famous LAME! Eventually the dumb bitch gets it and Emma Roberts overacted the ENTIRE scene! She wasn't scary or convincing as a psycho like the previous killers in the trilogy. Also when the movie ended we never got to see an after math, it just ends when they finally kill Jill.",2011
7,"I will say, Scream 4 was pretty generic, you saw certain things coming a mile away, but I still loved Scream 4, as I loved Scream 1-3 before it. I'm glad the movie contained the original cast, and the regulars were still their normal old selves.(Won't go further into that one) Honestly, even though I was a fan I really hope they don't make a fifth. This specific type of horror movie is in the past, and just doesn't keep up to pace with the genre anymore. I wish that the fourth movie hadn't been made at all, just in that the third gave a plausible ending and a motion that the characters themselves were ready to move on. I don't think the plot of Scream 4 was good enough to compete with that.",2011
7,Who could forget the first time Drew Barrymore met her end after being hunted down by ghost face in the original scream film some 15 years ago. Its been a decade since scream underwhelmed everybody with its lacklustre third instalment and with a fourth on the way I was sceptical about how the fourth would go and how it would affect the introduction to the review I would to write about it.,2011
1,It wasn't nearly as deep or character driven as the first two. Pretty much the only character I cared about besides the original trio was Kirby. It didn't take the time to properly flesh out most of the other characters (go figure; how ironic; especially with what was said in the beginning).,2011
1,"I was sitting up late last night watching TV when i noticed that Scream 4 was about to start on the Movie channel. When i first heard about the film (back when it was in production) i was interested to see it but it flew so far under the radar when it was released and just seemed to disappear. Out of curiosity i decided to watch it. Now that was my first mistake. This movie is just awful, i felt like i was watching the newest entry in the Scary Movie franchise, having Anthony Anderson cast in it also made it feel that way a little bit more. Don't get me wrong, amusing and likable actor but not in this film. The casting was atrocious, the plot was pathetic, acting from the new teenage characters was poor, even David Arquette seemed to be lacking in his acting. ",2012
4,"Once upon a time there was a scary movie trilogy, and now it's back. I've been looking forward to this one a little, but I also knew that Craven can disappoint from time to time. With the original cast, director and writer on board I had reasonably high hopes, though.",2013

1,"I was bitterly disappointed with the announcement of Scre4m to begin with. So what happened to ""The Scariest scream is always the last""- tag line of Scream 3? Wes Craven has just exposed himself as a massive lying money-grabber by even attempting to continue this series. Despite my reservations I did pay good money to go and watch this abomination.",2011
7,"It's been a while since I have seen a slasher, and Scream for that matter, yet here it is years later and finally we are getting back to the roots of the classic slasher. The movie starts out with a couple of funny scenes that lash out at the recent slashers that have been produced and how predictable and cheesy slasher films are, but then dives into the cliché of slashers starting with two helpless victims. After that, we start to get back into the classic killing spree that was seen in the first movie with the addition of a lot more gore. Yes, I'm sure we all know that slasher movies are becoming more famous for the increased amounts of blood that are constantly finding their way into the movies these days, as well as the increasing use of the F word.",2011
10,"this is the best film i have seen in a long time, all of these reboots and sequels have been rubbish, finally we have something fresh. scream 4 comes back to the basics of scream, the opening was the best ever, in my opinion just as good as Drew's in scream, it was so funny but also terrifying the way it moved from the comedic side to the horrifying side is unbelievable the way it goes is smart and very different, you will know what i mean when you see it. the acting was superb. the kills where extremely lengthy, just the way i like it, the way they were killed were very gory and bloody, this is definitely the bloodiest of them all especially one of them. the highest body-count by far. before watching this i thought it would be easy to work out the killer or killers, but there are a lot of twists in this film that you will not expect. definitely an Oscar worthy. Wes craven at by far his best ever! 10/10",2011
2,"As a massive fan of the ""Scream"" series (the third instalment not so much), I was over the moon when the fourth was announced last year, and waited very eagerly, yet patiently, for its release... What a complete waste of my time.",2011
10,i was very happy walking out of scream 4 i could not stop thinking about the first kill it was funny and brutal this movie was made by the same people that made pariah 3D that movie was horrible but this was a good way to start fresh. this movie being directed by the mastermind Wes craven the director of all the other screams the 3rd one may have been bad this one was 10 times better even maybe 100 times. There are still problems in this movie like how the end drags a little the dialogue could have been better at some points and right after the amazing opening seen it tries it inter dose all the characters again which takes awhile also the kills are all stabs not like saw where bones and blood are flying everywhere. To me i liked the stabbings more than death traps in saw. This movie brings back slashers and puts paranormal activity back in the trash this is good old fashion horrors and the best scream movie and it is better than most reboots which this is. so in the end i have one thing to say go watch SCREAM 4,2011
10,"It's been said that, given a set of paints and a brush and a million years, a chimp could paint the Mona Lisa. Maybe. Given a makeup kit and a million years, I seriously doubt I could do a decent zombie makeup. I've tried; it's just not something I'll ever be good at. The makeups the contestants on this show crank out, with the clock ticking and under microscopic scrutiny, is mind-boggling. I don't think I've seen a single creation by any one of them that I would hesitate to put front and center. Regardless of whether or not they ""make it"" on this show, they've all got more artistic ability in their pinkie toes than I do in my entire bulk. As far as I'm concerned, there ARE no losers on this show. Sincerely, Dazzled.",2012
9,"This is an example of a great reality show, what all should aspire to be; a competition about creativity, ability and skill. It is entrancing to see what the contestants can create in such a short amount of time, so much of their work is beautiful or grotesque (as required). When people see a movie, they just don't realize the talent and work required to bring these special effects to screen. Digital special effects have become the norm, but watching Face Off will make anyone appreciate the hands on teams and sometimes unsung heroes who do the Special Effects Makeups.",2013
10,"You know what is truly great about this competition show? People either win or lose not base on personality and the rest of the country calling, but by the experts. The judges are in the business and it is only appropriate that they along decide the fate of who goes on and who don't. I've seen some remarkable creations by some extremely talented and dedicate makeup professionals. You get to see a lot of the behind the scenes stuff and techniques in creature/character creations and how to make quality stuff on a budget. The contestants are always working with a time constraint and the stuff that comes out of their heads from just a suggestion is amazing. None of it comes off fake... none of that fake personality clash drama and a lot of the contestants tend to help out their fellow competitors, whether it is releasing a mode or coming up with a concept. I think that if this is your passion, to get into the movie business and be a creature/makeup professional this is a MUST show for you to watch. But even for a layman like me, I find it fascinating. And I generally like all the contestants on the show (except Frank from the first season). But I would love to just have a room full of paints and stuff and just told to create something. Even if I was to fail, it still would be so amazingly cool. And when people ""don't"" get along, they do tolerate, but it isn't fake. There is no yelling at each other or over the top acting out. It's just about people who are passionate about makeup. I give it a 10 as in not comparison to scripted show, but only comparison to other unscripted show and for me, its the best.",2013
8,"I can see how this show might not appeal to everyone, and MacKenzie Westmore is admittedly very robot-like, but aside from such small issues, it's entertaining T.V. One doesn't have to be a make-up artist to enjoy it. The entertainment stems from not only seeing the end make-ups,(although they are usually awesome)but from the interaction between the artists, seeing how they rise to the challenge, seeing what exactly goes into a make-up, and what matters to the judges. I don't usually watch reality T.V., but I have looked forward every week to the next episode; the next challenge. I would recommend ""Face Off"" to anyone who enjoys art.",2012
9,"One of the classiest reality shows on television. I know nothing about the makeup industry but who knew that I would find this subject so interesting. The contestants are so talented and you can tell they truly love what they are doing. I especially love the way the artists will occasionally jump in and help each other to get the job done which tells me how seriously they take their industry and, considering it is a competition, I think this is fabulous.",2014
9,"Being an aspiring FX makeup artist of course I'm going to love this show! I tune in every week and even find myself picking a cast member as a favorite for the season. Its an interesting show for EVERYONE! Even if you are not into doing FX its still a very fun show. I do wonder at times if the show might not be rigged sadly, at times the judges make very poor decisions that result in a cast member being thrown out that has dominated the majority of the season or favoring one that has been lacking. They do however portray the cast members accurately (most) of the time, i have trained under a past cast member and they never once made them out to be a villain or bad guy. I highly recommend it! You cant go wrong with this one!",2013
10,"Face Off is not some cheesy reality competition show like others. It is a superb and in depth look into the creation of fantastic makeups. It really shows how much hard work can go into something that can have so small or large of a role in a film. I would recommend this for any movie fan who loves watching behind the scenes on their Blu-Ray's or DVD's, and especially if you are considering makeup effects for a living. Another positive is that you find yourself critiquing the finished makeups along with the judges, which is good for any competition show. The reason this show isn't at a 10 is because it varies from episode to episode. Sometimes the challenges are weird and sometimes they are mind blowing, like the recent challenge of the artists making themselves superheroes. If you haven't seen this show yet give it a watch. It is on every Tuesday night on the Syfy channel.",2015
8,"FaceOff is a show that varies in quality from episode to episode, it all is based on both the challenges and the contestants. Sometimes you'll have a great weekly challenge but mediocre artists, and sometimes you'll have outstanding artists with an uninspiring weekly challenge. When it's ""bad"" it's slightly boring at worst, when it's ""good"" it's freaking epic! For every two or three boring generic make ups on this show there is one awesome one that will make you drop your jaw in amazement. Special mention goes to the Neptune Werewolf, RJ's Lizard Flower, and a majority of makeups that Roy or Eric Fox made. If FaceOff had awesome challenges and awesome make ups every episode I would give it a 9, however since this is not always the case I can only give it an 8....",2014
10,"Defiantly not a show for younger viewers because its like any other elimination show; People are unpredictable and can cuss someone out on one episode or get in a physical altercation the next. I have yet to see anything like that is this show, but the blood and special effects are not age appropriate for children. I honestly can say that this truly is one of the best elimination show I have ever seen and really hope to see many more seasons. It defiantly is a must see for anyone who enjoys special effects in movies. The fact that movies are an every day joy for most people, it gives you a look behind the curtains and see the blood and sweat the make-up artiest go through to make the next movie better then the last. I loved hearing that the first seasons winner worked on The Hunger Games and look forward to seeing more of them become successful.",2012
8,"""Face Off"" is a marvelous competition show in which contestants must complete weekly challenges, with the loser being eliminated. The format is nothing special (see ""Project Runway"" or ""Dancing with the Stars""), but this is a quality show because the contestants are talented, imaginative people and all the voting is done by experts.",2015
10,I LOVE watching the talent on this show. This show has evolved through the years to be MORE about the art and has started showing the positive sides of competition.,2018
9,The amount of creativity and skill these make up artists have is nothing short of amazing. I love watching this show to see what incredible visions they come up with.,2017
10,I'm not a huge fan of reality shows but this is one of the exceptions. Most of these contestants are amazingly talented. It's amazing what they are able to conceive & produce in such a short time. The host can be a bit robotic as well as one judges (SMILE ALREADY) but these are small details that pale in comparison to the entertainment and talent that the show delivers. I'm left in awe each week! One other thing I absolutely love about this show is that most of the contestants are willing to lend aide and advice to other contestants even when it's not a team challenge; rarely does there seem to be bitterness or backstabbing.,2017

4,"I enjoy bad movies, and enjoy bad remakes even more. So when the opportunity to get advanced passes to the atrocious looking remake of Footloose came, I pounced on them just out of the sheer will to see what kind of monstrosity Craig Brewer and company came up with. The film had gone through a number of changes, and had plenty of room to improve on the original. Sadly, I do not think there was ever any hope for it.",2011
3,"The only real reason to pay any attention at all to the new Footloose is to watch the music video for the terrific Big and Rich song ""Fake ID."" Other than that, there is little appeal in the film, as it shamelessly recycles almost every scene, event, and line from its original counterpart, and the ones it doesn't, it modifies for an audience that is questionably existent. If there's anything the film made me do, it made me seriously contemplate what a ""remake"" actually is and what their inherent goal is. To make the original material better? Make the story more current? Give it a stronger, more contemporary feel and look? If those questions were considered during the making of the Footloose remake, they weren't considered for very long. This is a stale, unimaginably boring picture, with its first real problem being it is trying to make an immensely dated story of music and dancing banishment current and relatable to teenagers of the present. In a time where vulgar rap by artists named ""Chief Keef,"" ""Juicy J,"" and ""Wiz Khalifa"" can be found on the iPods of teens in schools and they can get away with it, I highly doubt teens will be able to resonate with playing Kenny Loggins or Quiet Riot a bit too loud.",2013
3,"I love the original and was really excited to see this remake. I was very disappointed. They copied the original, just added cell phones and CD's and a few modern dance moves. Same soundtrack, just a hint modernized, I'm pretty sure even some of the lines were exactly the same. There was nothing creative or original about this movie.",2013
6,"I was a teen when the original movie came out, and I also live near Lehi, Utah where it was filmed which made me think fondly of the movie whenever I drove by the Lehi Roller Mills. (Today it is a sprawling metropolis, resembling little of the sleepy little town like in the movie.) When I heard another pointless remake was coming out, I decided to give it the Redbox treatment instead of completely boycotting it.",2012
2,"Yes, the original film was like a lot of 80s movies--campy, silly and sometimes just about the music—but this remake should have been forgotten. While the writers kept quite a few original lines and the director kept some iconic scenes, something was lost in translation. That loss cannot be blamed on any one part of the film but rather the disgraceful whole.",2012
1,I don't understand why we need to remake great movies. this movie sucks. Stay with the original. I was disappointed in the music. I am happy that a few of the original songs were in it. one song was changed and sang different. That was horrible. The songs and dance scenes needed to be the way it was in the original movie. I understand that it is a 2011 version of the movie but I think too many things were changed. I am not knocking the actors in any way. they are great actors and amazing dancers. I am just not a fan of the movie it self. the actors are amazingly talented. I am just not a big fan of remakes. The movie had too many changes.,2012
1,"What was the point? The director just went through and removed all the good stuff from the first movie. The original is based on events which took place in Elmore City, OK and yes, they banned dancing. It's hard for today's teens to fathom how religious the 80s were, which might be why they can't grasp a movie like this. You can't make a modern remake of this movie because today's kids aren't suffocating under this type of extreme religiosity. In the original, the ban is on dancing, including a teen prom. The kids are only being reasonable to protest this. In this remake, the ban is on ""lewd and lascivious dancing"" which the teens think they have a right to perform in the streets.",2013
4,The 80s version had more energy and focus. This remake was a bit lacking in impact. The story is similar to the original but here the obstacles felt contrived especially the confrontations with the trashy boyfriend. Dennis Quaid and Andie Macdowell looked like they would rather be elsewhere.,2012
1,"The original Footloose was a little film with a debatable script and a little budget. But contrary to all expectations was quite successful across the globe and became with time a cult movie and that thanks to the infectious music, dance routines quite impressive for the time, but most of all to a brilliant casting, believable and very suitable to their roles. Same thing that happened to Dirty Dancing. So take the original cast, the music and the novelty of the dance routines away from the equation and what is left is a very forgettable film with very unmemorable music, very ordinary dance routine and with a cast that makes you miss the old one every step of the way. Who was the guy playing the main role? I can't even remember his face that much mediocre he was and what about the leading lady, with no depth what so ever, painfully bad actors both with no chemistry between them. Do we need to equal the tension between the unassuming sex appeal of Kevin Bacon in that role and the irresistibly attractive vulnerability brought to the role by Lori Singer? Was it a not intentional carrier suicide taking up roles that are so vividly embedded in people memories? Was it? Well, I feel I need to mention, the countryman friend role, that in the original was so adorably played by Chris Penn, the guy who played the same part is such a poor takeoff, a caricature and his girlfrienda bubbly full of energy Sara Jessica Parker against a very dull actress there to fill space and nothing more. Even the original father and mother role (the preacher and his wife) were far more engaging at the point that you could see their point of view and sympathize, the original roles were played by John Lithgow and Dianne Weist, (believable even as a loving couple) in this new version played by Dennis Quaid and Andy MacDowell , that I usually really like, here they fell flat unable to be convincing in their role as troubled preacher and over concern but very tender and caring father and as the effectual moderator, sweet but strong mother as it was in the original. I'm sorry but would this film be an original it could be only regarded as a mediocre film, being a remake of a little delightful cult film is a very sorry version, terrible, not recommended unless you watch it on television and want something boring to doze off.",2012
3,"I had such high hopes for this movie. I was excited by the beginning, tragic explanation of what happened to make the townsfolk think it was a good idea to create a string of very strict laws. That's where the excitement ended. Aside from a few entertaining scenes, i.e. Willard learning how to dance with a bunch of cute little girls, it was one confused ""Seriously!?!"" moment after another.",2012
2,"This remake of the timeless, Kevin Bacon starring classic doesn't even make you want to tap your foot or even dance to the beat. No, it might make you want to get up and leave instead of get up and dance.",2012
9,"I found the remake of Footloose thoroughly enjoyable. Granted, I wasn't around when the original was released and don't have the attachment to it of teens of that time, but I appreciated this movie. It may not have had the best acting as the original or carried the same weight, but it was a feel-good movie that put a smile on a my face. It had amazing dance sequences and great music that left me dancing out of the theater. Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough brought a certain airy feeling to the film that was missing from the original, and their chemistry-- especially on the dance floor--was palpable. I think that it was a perfect movie for my generation who didn't grow up watching the original.",2012
3,"In 1984 Kevin Bacon starred in Footloose. It was not a great movie, but it was a fun movie that started a nice career. Now there is the remake. Remakes have a bad habit of tearing a treasured movie down and making a terrible movie in it's place. This is so true of this version of Footloose. It starts with all the bad remakes of 80's songs--why not just use the original artists rather than a terrible singer trying to sing. Like we need some bad singer remake Bonnie Tyler or Kenny Loggins. Next Julianne Hough may be able to dance and sing, but she was the absolute wrong choice for the lead actress. She is not an actress and her money may get her some roles, but she is one of those bad actresses that became popular in another genre that quickly disappears. My biggest disappointment is Dennis Quaid. What is happening with him? I was a big Quaid fan, but he is now making bad movies. He needs to reevaluate his decisions and either take roles for a man his age that have substance or retire from film.",2012
1,"I already talked about the musical in my original review so I will not talk about it here or at least try not to or say stuff that I forgot. But seriously, I think I am the only one who agrees with Roger Ebert that the first one was bad, but the remake is bad also. But the difference is, I hate the remake even more. This might be the worst remake of all time and you will not understand the reasoning for this so I will try to explain to my very best. ",2015
1,"This movie sucked big time! They remixed all of the songs from the original for no reason and it sucked so bad! I almost wanted to throw up after seeing it. The dancing is just so embarrassing and it basically craps all over the original. I'm so appalled that this movie has a rating higher than a one. It sucks so bad it should of been rated the worst remake in the history of remakes! I would much rather see somebody suffering a horrible death than ever watch this film again. I feel embarrassed to be called a human being because this film shows how stupid we all are! We let this happen and now there's no hope. If aliens come down from space and see this movie they will probably look at us as if we are the dumbest living thing on the planet! This movie is the reason an apocalypse should happen!

What a waste...",2013
3,"Pro: They added a slightly more emotional back story and had more finality to said issues. Ariel was played by an attractive woman rather that a tall 12 year old boy in a bad wig. The character of Willard could really dance, rather than learn to simply shake his hands and chest bump, and the learning to dance sequence was amusingly horrendous rather too embarrassing to watch. They actually managed to cast someone who makes Sarah Jessica Parker look attractive by comparison. The people Ren lives with are loving and supportive rather than judgmental. The dancing was overall quite impressive.",2012
4,"The previews looked terrible but I wanted to like it and thought maybe it would be fun fluff. Nope. The original, '80s version wasn't rocket science but it was fun and sweet with great music and was loved by kids and adults. My mom played the soundtrack all the time. The premise of the original was taken with a grain of salt. In the remake they try to focus on the premise by getting all dramatic and emotional which just makes the fact that dancing is outlawed outrageous and comical. Not to mention, why would they outlaw dancing for drinking and driving? That's rather far fetched. In the original both Ren and Ariel had problems...but they seemed to deal with them like any other teen, with trademark angst, so, you could identify with them and like them. In the remake they have therapy kind of anger and issues that I could not identify with and the script failed to make the characters sympathetic, so, I didn't care about them. Ren was more just angry and a bit of a jerk (though, lesser in the sense that they added much bigger jerks to this film, I suppose in an attempt to make him more likable, though, that failed), and Ariel was also angry, reckless, slutty, bratty, and made her best friend angry...what is to like about that? In the original, Kevin Bacon was cute and charming and a leader. In this one Ren is kind of dorky, has a weird Boston accent that comes in and out, brooding, and everyone in the film is angry, rebellious and breaking the law of dancing so there is no real reason for Ren to even be in this film other than to add to the mix. He doesn't stand out in anyway, he just seems like some random face in the crowd trying to get through school so he can grow up to be an angry adult who works as a mechanic or something.",2013

8,"We all face an existential crisis at some time or another, just usually not when we're seven, which will likely be the mean age of children watching this newest non-Pixar non- DreamWorks animated feature. No, ""Rango"" won't challenge kids to contemplate their role in the cosmos, but that's precisely the predicament of its main character, a theatrical lizard who finds himself — as many animals in animated films do these days — thrust out of domestic bliss and forced to reckon with the untamed and unforgiving nature of the wild natural world. But in addition to all its verboseness and abstract homage to classic Westerns, ""Rango"" equally dishes out top-notch physical humor and creative characters for the young ones to lap up, even if they're not exactly of age to, as the film puts at least once, ""ruminate.""",2011
9,"Director Gore Verbinski has put together quite the filmography over the years. His first feature film was the family comedy Mousehunt, which he followed up with the R-rated action comedy The Mexican. He also jumped on the successful remake bandwagon before the trend really took off with The Ring. It was the Pirates of the Caribbean films that teamed the director with the hottest actor in Hollywood today; Johnny Depp. Perhaps it's because those films made over a billion dollars at the box office or because they just had fun working together or a little bit of both that Depp was chosen to voice a talking chameleon in Verbinski's bizarre yet spectacular animated adventure known as Rango.",2011

8,"So a slight blurb about how surprised I was that Nickelodeon was tackling several mature themes: Rango boasted quite a number of darker undertones that you wouldn't normally expect from a PG, animated Nickelodeon movie. Such areas included language (sporting such lines as ""You son of a-""!, ""Go to hell!"", and ""Can I gut-shoot someone?""), violence (an impressive amount of shooting and dying), sexual themes (making references to how ""active"" one's mother was and a joke about a mammogram), and the film's portrayal of death (where characters constantly expect Rango's death and at one point, parody death by hanging). That is, you could arguably find just as much material in other animated films, such as The Incredibles- but it just goes to show that Nickelodeon is ready to experiment with a braver sort of film, much like Disney did with Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay, disclaimer over. ",2011

8,"After an extremely weak first quarter in the cinematic world full of remakes, re-dos, 3-D flicks and movies about gnomes (reallyreally?) we finally have something fresh, original, and quite trippy to kickoff 2011. Once again reaching into his Western roots, Gore Verbinski makes up for what he did to World's End and delivers one heck of an animated film. Rango is full of surprises: surprisingly violent, surprisingly smart, surprisingly full of western references left and right, and with a surprisingly incredible western score that matches that of Ennio Morricone (never thought I'd say that). If you can muster its sluggish start, extremely fast-pace humor and rather bizarre moments throughout, then you will thoroughly enjoy Rango and its Western mayhem. And who said the Western genre is dead....",2011

Pirate movies were dead and buried and it took the monumental success of Verbinski and Depp's first endeavour to show that genre movies can work, if the source material is good enough. 8 years later Pirates 4 sails over the horizon, Verbinski has walked the plank following the disappointing story-telling of Pirates 2 and 3, and Depp has just made The Tourist. Suffice to say that the two of them could do with a hit right now, but is an animated western really the way to go",2011

But, after a while, it all gets 100% predictable and boring. Basically, it transforms into standard: Good Hero fights his complexes to help Other Stupid Cowards and defeat Bad Hero. Children around you start crying, you yawn and fun ends. Well, there is still hope, so you are not leaving the movie room, expecting to have at least some fun. Time passes, you fight your boredom, Good Hero fights his personal problems, still no fun. You continue thinking about leaving, but curiosity wins and you decide to wait until the end in hope that, maybe, the movie will have not an ordinary ending...

This little creature considers himself an actor and tries to put on performances with inanimate objects in his glass tank. After somehow breaking out, he's left to contend with the perils of the desert. Escaping the dangers of a hawk, the chameleon takes refuge with another lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) who is heading back to her town of Dirt. When he arrives there himself, he finds that the town is continuously suspicious of outsiders. This is primarily because the town's water supplies are so low. There's barely enough to last for the next six days. To prove himself to his sceptics, the chameleon pretends to be a fierce outlaw, telling tales about his heroics. Winning the respect of the people, the chameleon calls himself Rango and is made the sheriff of Dirt.

The story is all over the place, you don't get to know any of the musketeers, or barely a character at all and the biggest problem: A movie doesn't have to be realistic for me but it has to make sense in his own universe of the movie (like Matrix its not realistic but logical). The three musketeers plays with the rules of physics, logic and sense of a human being like they were beanbags.

When I heard that a new Three Musketeers film was going to be released, I was really excited - all the more when I saw pictures of the beautiful locations in Bavaria and read that Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"") would play my favourite character Richelieu. When I saw the trailer though, I was shocked: Matrix style bullet evasion? A Ninja diver? And... zeppelin air ships? WTF? I was sure Dumas was rotating in his grave over this mutilation done to his work! Really... I don't think a brilliant story like The Three Musketeers needs air ships in order to be exciting.",2011
1,"I actually expected this movie to be bad based on the previews, and after the first 5 minutes, which were kind of entertaining, I thought ""maybe this won't be so bad"". But every attempt at humor is completely dry, and the story is told in the worst way possible. Aside from the opening scene, everything added to the story in an attempt to make it different from the standard Three Musketeer plot is completely lame. And even Orlando Bloom acted like a rookie! I don't know how on earth this managed to get financed. If you want some real entertainment, watch the 1993 version, in which Tim Curry is the best evil Cardinal ever!",2011

But recently these so called Hollywood blockbusters have left me with no choice. So lets come to this movie now. First off who did the casting for this movie and who wrote the script if you can call it a script. I guess the plan in the boardroom was lets take good actors like Chris Waltz, Mads Mikkelson, Ray Stevenson and even Luke Evans. All these actors except Luke Evans I love dearly. But in this movie all the director and producer did was under-use the best actors in the movie and instead give all the screen time to Mila and Logan. I personally enjoy watching Mila in Resident Evil series but here she was just unnecessary. And this kid Logan, who calls him an actor, i am furious that he got paid to do this role so poorly. I am a business grad so I work better in explaining things in points. So i will just make a list of what I felt was wrong with this movie; here it goes: The three musketeers, um mm I mean the four musketeers I guess - ",2012
5,'The Three Musketeers'was a film that was clearly a waste of my valuable time. The main reason I gave it a 5 was because not much happened but also I didn't fall asleep or leave the room.It wasn't the worst time waster I've seen so any ratings less than 4 out of 10 wouldn't be correct in my opinion but neither would any ratings over 6 out of 10.,2012

1,"So the other week I decided to watch the new version of the Three Musketeers because I have always liked the Musketeers. It was, to be frank, utterly deplorable, compared the story and the movies prior. I couldn't even finish it. For one, somethings in it were highly unrealistic for the time period. Flying technology did not exist, nor were people able to leap through the air and dodge things like in the Matrix. The fighting scenes were unrealistic whereas in the original version, the fights seemed more real and as if they could have happened. The Uniforms of the Musketeers and especially the Cardinal's Men were highly inaccurate and looked more like something out of a fairytale. In the 1993 Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask, although King Louis is arrogant and spoiled, he is a strong leader. In the new version, King Louis seems more like a child who wants to play dress up. In conclusion, I wouldn't give this movie a half star rating. Throw it out. The originals are incredibly better.",2012

I read some comments and it seems there was witch hunt for this nice and entertaining movie. It is not the best movie of 2011 but come on, it is much better than a lot of movies that have way higher ratings. First of all, the action is pretty good. The acting is very well done and the CGI is used professionally. This is a modern approach to the classic three musketeers and I enjoyed it a lot. From my point of view, a remake needs to add some stuff to the original movie and this movie made it successfully.",2012
6,"At first glance, we all know that this will never be a great version of The Three Musketeers but with all the flying ships and the swashbucklery, we can still give it a try. The film ends up pretty fun. Even with all the silly nonsense and the modern stuff scattered in the film. The cast made it enjoyable. The 3D is surprisingly good. But in the end, it's just another blockbuster. The film also had troubles to its pacing and the writing is a bit modern.

1,"It is very hard to overweight Alexandre Dumas. It is not a crime to try and fail, but to preposterously change history, murder characters, take out key elements of the story it is the closest thing to literary crime. As we can see, somebody not only did that, but succeeded to put it into a movie. That is the only success the movie had. Luckily nobody tried to change the genders of the musketeers but unfortunately the four main characters had little to do along the movie. It was much more easy to use one or two of them, because the other ones were just a waste of script. There is no might in Porthos, no mystery or wisdom in Athos, no priesthood in Aramis. The original story is downgraded to the extreme. I am a fan of the books written by Alexandre Dumas so for fans the movie starts to stink after the first minutes. That is why there is no reason to go into details about how the actors played and why the interpretation was so lame. There are some enjoyable moments but the bitter taste of insufficient imagination spoils the overall experience. My question was why they bother to take a well-known classical story, when is easier to write a new one and go with it. There is a clear trend of distorting the old stories and make them fit ""panem et circenses"" because most of movie industry is mediocre. The only way that trend is reversed is by treating second hand work for what it is and marl it clearly. Like this we may give in the future a chance to young viewers to enjoy real plots, good scripts and excellent movies. Unfortunately this movie is not even a classical example of failure it's just a product of consumerism, see it, throw it away and make space for the next lame one.",2012

This movie will make you not only appreciate all the work went into it, but it will make you appreciate life itself. It is so brutally realistic. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen are a great duo and the supporting cast does a great job as well. This movie was made with respect for its viewers. It takes something so serious and so taboo to laugh at and makes it a comedy and a drama. It exceeds in both genres. If I am correct, this movie is somewhat based on the Screenwriter's life who also went through something very similar and most of the events in the film are based on things he had to go through as he also got cancer in his 20s.",2011

Add in the fact that when Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Adam Lerner is only 27 years old when he gets the news and you already have a story primed for melodrama and loaded with tears and cheers. First-time writer Will Reiser uses his own experience with cancer at a young age to play down the dramatic aspects of illness, and instead showcase the lighter side of things, showing that even when you have cancer you still want to get laid and stoned with your best friend. It's not a strict comedy by any means, there are quite a few moments that got me a little choked up, but Reiser clearly set out with a goal to show things a little lighter than cancer is usually treated in the film. For the most part this works and, although at times I felt it was a little too light, I enjoyed Reiser's more authentic portrayal of a diagnosis like this.",2011
3,"50/50 is by Will Reiser, who by his own admission had writer's block until he was stricken with a rare form of spinal cancer. He thought it would be an original idea if he wrote a 'comedy' about a topic he was familiar with. As it turned out, 50/50 (which refers to the protagonist's chances of survival), plays more like a 'dramedy', than a narrative written strictly for laughs.",2012
6,"Cancer has always been a serious subject, and when used in films it is always tearjerking and realistic, Terms of Endearment for example, so you would never think that they could make a comedy film where it is the main plot, but then this came along. Basically twenty seven year old public radio journalist Adam Lerner (Golden Globe nominated Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is just your normal average guy with artist girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) and co-worker best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen). His life dramatically changes however when he goes to the doctor suffering with strange aches and pains, and he is diagnosed with a very rare form of spinal cancer, meaning that he will undergo chemotherapy, and looking the disease up on the internet it looks like he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam tells Kyle who sticks very close with him for support and to give him positivity about his condition, and when he tells his overbearing mother Diane (Anjelica Huston), who cares for his father Richard (Serge Houde) who is suffering Alzheimer's disease, she is very concerned. He does accept his mother's offer to stay at their house to be cared for, and Rachael, despite being uncomfortable going with him to hospital, says that she will help take care of him, that is until Kyle sees her kissing another man and reveals this to Adam. After the break up Kyle keeps his spirits up, and he says that Adam should try and use his disease for his own benefit, such as picking up women who will feel sympathetic, so with a shaved head, prior to chemotherapy, they try this theory out. Seeking more positivity and advice Adam starts seeing young and inexperienced therapist Katherine McKay (Up in the Air's Anna Kendrick), they start a rocky relationship of sessions, but he opens up to her about many things and they start to see each other outside of sessions as friends, and he also becomes friends with fellow chemotherapy patients Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Frewer). Mitch dies and fears are obviously welling up inside of Adam, especially after he discovers the therapy is not working and a risky surgery is the last resort, and the night before he has a bad argument with a drunken Kyle, and he calls Katherine to get some much needed support. The next day Kyle and he make amends and go to the hospital, and after the six hour operation to remove the tumour the doctors tell Kyle, Diane, Katherine and Richard that the bone degradation was worse than first thought, but the surgery was successful and they hear Adam will recover. The film ends happily with Adam recovering very well, with Kyle rubbing cream onto the huge scar on his back, and he is getting ready for a date with Katherine, and together they smile wondering what the future will hold. Also starring Andrew Airlie as Dr. Ross. Gordon-Levitt gives a good vulnerable and touching performance as the victim to the fateful disease, Rogen gives his usual great brash and sometimes foul-mouthed performance as his best friend, together they are a good double act, and other cast members Howard, Kendrick and Houston also do well being concerned and supportive, the story does not make any jokes about what is happening to the character, but it does leave room for social and dialogue humour, so it all adds up to an interesting comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Good!",2012
3,"This was a disappointment of a movie. Everything good about it was shown in the trailer. It quickly lost my interest and attention as the acting was below par, artificial, and the emotion of the serious storyline was not delivered well. There was nothing extremely likable about any of the characters, in fact most of them were annoying. We had a jerk friend, a cheating girlfriend, an overbearing mother, and an incredibly stupid therapist who should never be allowed a license. There were a few funny parts but most of it was typical Seth Rogan humor. In other words 90% of what comes out of his mouth is about weed or getting laid, both of which get very old after a short time. It was a cliché ending with him being guaranteed to be okay and him going out with the therapist. This was almost an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It isn't like none of us saw that coming from the moment they met. Overall it was a waste of time. I would not recommend this, the trailer is all you need to see.",2015
8,"I think what makes 50/50 such a success is the film doesn't ever feel like it needs to manipulate your emotions, as many a movie about cancer falls prey to, instead just looking at a life through a realistic lens from the perspective of a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) having to deal with a tumor growing on his spine. He has an obscene (but totally loyal) buddy played by Seth Rogan, always drunk, hitting on girls, and swearing (when not smoking pot and trying to convince Gordon-Levitt to go to bars with him), a sham of a girlfriend (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, stuck with a character so self-absorbed, with a personality ill-equipped for giving care and affection to someone in need of both, that she has no chance of escaping the ""bitch we love to hate""; it does provide a moment of great humor when Gordon-Levitt tells her to get of his porch, soon joining Rogan in destroying her painting that once hung above the television), a psychiatrist working on her doctorate and a bit inexperienced (Anna Kendrick, becoming quite a character actress; if she could just avoid the ""Pitch Perfect"" films, I think the sky's the limit) who is becoming a possible new love interest, an overprotective mother (Angelica Huston, just wonderful) who just wants her son to return her phone calls (and make him dinner if he'll let her) he's embarrassed by, a father now lost to senility, and a couple of fellow cancer patients (Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall) who understand his situation all too well. Learning of the cancer (I think there's a great bit of cinematography here were the focus of the cancer doc's face (still speaking of the rarity of such cancer in someone of his age) eventually fades with Gordon-Levitt having to let this news sink in), cutting of his hair (with Rogen's shaver which could have been used for his body hair), dealing with a cheating girlfriend that abandoned him when he needed her the most (caught at her art gallery with a hippie by Rogan who snaps a photo on his phone), trying to avoid as much of revealing his pent up emotions to his psychiatrist yet finding her presence in his life a gradual help, facing the fears of dying and the eventual delicate and dangerous surgery, and ultimately blessed with a new outlook on life (and perhaps love). This is indeed uplifting but not in the usual Lifetime/Hallmark channel way; the dialogue is frank and profane, emotional outbursts (or scenes where Gordon-Lewitt is sick and too tired to stand) aren't overdramatized with a heavy score, and there's plenty of adult comedy that can offset the grim diagnosis that heavily looms throughout. Rogan is playing another version of himself; using the cancer to pick up girls, boozing and oftentimes drunk, blunt and viewed as obnoxious (and not without plenty of dirty jokes and salty language), this character doesn't stray from Rogan's comfort zone. Yet he's there for his friend all the way. Gordon-Levitt proves here, significantly, that he's among the best actors of his generation. Scary is I think he still can get even better.",2013

10,"This is my first review ever, so please pardon me.",2012
1,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I just made no sense whatsoever! (Possible spoilers!) Why would they leave the plane, which I'm sure had a GPS locater and instead go run into the wilderness where they have little possibility of ever being found? Why would they not use the parts of the plane to build a barrier and ring of fire around themselves? Why did they not scavenge the plane for any and everything useful (i.e., extra clothes, food, those mini-liquor bottles to fuel a fire, sharp pieces of broken metal to fight the wolves, etc.)? What happened to those bullet sticks they all once had? Why would you trudge through knee-deep snow, knowing that wolves were around without at least a big stick? And once you did find a river, why would you not try to construct some sort of raft, being that most rivers flow to some sort of civilization? And how could you just leave someone alone to die? And really? That river wasn't that deep--he couldn't have figured out that his foot was stuck? And then afterward, main character who just came out of the freezing river, is running around without a jacket and gloves and is not yet dead of hypothermia? Just seemed to me to be about perfect candidates for the Darwin awards.",2012
2,"Don't waste your time or money on this stupid movie. The ending alone is enough to anger and frustrate any normal blooded viewer, but add to that all the foolishness the characters display and you have to have no intellect to enjoy this movie. Let me list the stupid things the characters do: 1. They leave the downed plane to head off on their own without a clue where they are or where they are headed. When someone says that a search and rescue will be coming, Neeson's character flatly denies that they will be able to find them. His remarks are supposed to indicate the stupidity of the rescuers but only confirms his own. 2. They leave the plane, which could have easily been converted into a formidable protection for the group and head out into the open to be picked off by deranged wolves that think smarter than the humans. 3. They all seem to have knives and duct tape, why not cut off some branches from the trees and tape the knives to the ends of them and then spear the wolves instead of that cockamamy idea of trying to set off shotgun shells at the end of sticks. 3. In the wild, with predators lurking, you never walk empty handed. You would make a spear and walk with that. These fools wander around without so much as a club for protection. 4. When they finally kill a wolf, Neeson's character tells them to eat up as that is the last meat they will have. It seems they cant think well enough to pack up the rest of the meat and carry it with them! 5. Anyone who would consider a plan of jumping off a cliff in the hopes of landing in the opposite side trees has got to be suffering from brain damage. 6. In the end Neeson prepares to square off against alpha male Wolf and tapes airplane liquor bottles between his fingers as a sort of mace. The only thing that will do is cut his own hand to ribbons when the glass shatters in the fight. 7. Neesons' character has his meltdown moment and rails at God for not helping him...I couldn't help but smile at what God's reply might have been, ""Have you considered using the brain I gave you?!""",2012
3,"I enjoyed the first half of this movie simply because I wanted to enjoy it. I went into the theatre having really liked Taken and Unknown and was expecting to feel the same about this. But after about halfway I was getting more and more desperate, and I knew deep down in my heart it had failed. ",2012
2,I would start from the positive. Excellent playing by Liam Neeson. Great photography and great editing. Some parts are scary as intended. That's the reason I gave it two stars and not one.,2012
7,"I'm surprised to see the number of negative reviews here and also surprised as to the number of comparisons to Lee Tamahori's 'The Edge'; a completely different type of film in my opinion despite the similar locales. Unrelentingly bleak with almost no glimpse of warmth ( both literally and figuratively!) during the whole running time it's easy to see that this film will not be for everyone. The absence of a heroic ending and the depiction of the absolute fragility of man (and futility of machismo) will also serve to divide audiences even further. But, if you can get past these things and can overlook a couple of plot points that might seem illogical you are in for one heck of visceral cinematic ride. The story is simple - Liam Neeson is a distraught widower contracted to shoot Wolves in the Alaskan oil fields. On a flight to the mainland for R&R the plane goes down in the middle of nowhere and he and six other passengers are the only remaining survivors. The motley group must contend with a grim situation that see's them dropped in a freezing barren wasteland with no food, shelter or weapons and a pack of hungry Timber Wolves keen to pick them off one by one. I liked the AO Scott review for this film in which he pointed out that the film posed and answered a number of theological and existential questions in a very quiet and dignified way. Quite un-Hollywood. This is no Tom Hanks picture and unlike the aforementioned The Edge it's never for a minute considered an option for the men to make a stand against the Wolves in the way that Charles and Bob did with Bart the Bear in that film. They are completely at the mercy of the environment and it's predators whilst also being aware of the increasing futility of their plight. The film goes against the grain right from the outset and it's a stylistic decision from the creators that simultaneously elevates it above many of it's counterparts but also probably limits it's broader appeal - an early scene immediately after the crash where Neeson comforts a dying man is one of the most powerful and beautiful pieces of acting I've seen in recent years. To summarize, I found the film a very intense watch and it stayed with me for long time afterwards. Surely the hallmarks of a great picture?",2012
1,"OK this contains spoilers!!! Airplane crashes in icy cold land.Seven survivors, loads of wolves (and lots of plastic wolves). Survivors leave safety of plane and wander off into the icy cold land.

3,"""If they send fifty planes, maybe they'll find us. But they won't send fifty planes, because it won't matter, becausewe won't have time to wait for the one or two that they will send."" That was the flimsy basis to explain why a bunch of professionals should decide to wander of into the frozen tundra and certain death rather than build a shelter and wait for an imminent rescue attempt. ERGH, wouldn't the plane have stuck to a well laid out flightpath since leaving base and had a GPS locater on on-board? Besides, wouldn't wouldn't heading off to the forests be like entering the natural hunting ground of wolves anyway? This film left me rooting for the wolves (bigbadmoviereviews)",2012
9,"Liam Neeson the gritty action hero. How unbelievable that at nearly 60 years old, an actor can redefine his career and become more bankable. Neeson has somehow re-channeled the seriousness he brought to dramatic roles into creating utterly convincing heroes in decent (at best) thrillers. ",2012
1,"I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson, but come on now... you must admit this movie was horrible. Probably the biggest contributor to the failure of this movie is that they showed the ENDING SCENE IN THE PREVIEWS!!! Since when is this OK??? I went to this movie to see a Glass-Fist-Wolf-Fight, and it never freakin' happened!!! The wolves were quite fake looking, not even close to realistic, and the whole movie dragged on 'til the end when I thought I would finally see the battle I came to see, and then.. the screen goes black and credits start to roll!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!?? You don't tease people with a hand to hand wolf fight in the preview if the movie never actually shows the fight. Big disappointment!! This movie was pure crap in my opinion.",2012
2,"The problem with this movie is that it is completely generic and predictable. A story that did not have to be told. If it wasn't for Liam Neeson, few would watch it.

Some meaningless conversations and then they all die.",2012
1,My son really wanted to see this move because of the previews. I caved in and took him. The movie was very slow at times and kept you waiting for something to happen. There were times I kept thinking it was going to turn around but it just never happened. As for the ending...it was very disappointing to sit through two hours and not have one person make it out alive. At the end of the movie in a theater that was packed...you could have heard a pin drop. The only noise were comments of you've got to be kidding... Not good at all. The preview was pretty much the movie. Save your money and if you are really into survival movies then get it on video for a buck.,2012
6,"I must admit, going into this film, I was rather excited; I've enjoyed both of David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's previous collaborations and my interest in both Freudian psychology/psychoanalysis and Michael Fassbender practically guaranteed that I would be seeing this film. I fear now, however, that my expectations may have been a bit too high. ",2011
6,"This started very well, great cast, landscapes, scenography, characters etc. I loved the idea of to greatest psychology minds working together on improving therapy methods and changing the approach to curing people of their traumas and problems. Where i find the movie failed a bit is the story where the connections in the scenes are bit off. I got the feeling that it was jumping trough periods without any connection which i could put together. It seemed like there were years in gaps between couple of scenes where there wasn't any. Even if this followed only true life events of Jung and Freud it still leaves us with wanting more then just few dialogs and scratch on the surface of psychology treatments. Kinsey (2004) is a movie which is a good parallel example how a movie about similar subject can be and can be done brilliantly. Maybe movies about lives of both Jung and Freud are in order. So, all in all, i enjoyed watching it, everyone did a great job and gives you a good feeling after, it has minor gaps in the story which doesn't make you stick to the chair but definitely recommend it to everyone.",2012
7,I've only read very few of Jung's and Freud's abstracts of work but i've always been interested in knowing a bit more. A Dangerous Method cleared some of my questions and was pleasant for me to watch and learn a thing or two about their contributions and contradictions in psycho-analysis.,2011
7,"I really expected more by this movie, I expected more pathos, but unfortunately it proved scarcely involving and too rational. Nothing to say against the perfect technical execution, and the good acting, but what is disappointing is the screenplay, which should have been, in my opinion, the most significant element of the picture. Dialogues are flat, too rationally aimed at conveying an encyclopedic definition of psychoanalysis, but incapable of conveying empathy towards any of the three main characters, Jung, Freud and Sabine Spielrein. In the end we do not get the depth of each character, and the subtlety of their relationship. Keira Knightely 's character is overacted, excessive,but in the end underdeveloped, just the prototype of a pathologically insane. Freud appears a weird old man, only caring for what the scientific community might think, but not as daring as we think he might have been, Jung is a pathetic unfaithful man, but with an inner fragility we cannot perceive fully. And the complexity of the relation analyst-patient as well as master-disciple never comes out. It's a movie that seems to promise plenty, seems to be always on the verge of revealing something, but never takes off, as if the director wanted to keep a distance from the handled subject, as if afraid of being swept away by the abyss of the human complex mind. Or maybe because the complexity is too great to be thoroughly revealed? maybe, but being this the reason, the result remains unconvincing.",2011
5,"As a long admirer of David Cronenberg, I eagerly await each of his new films as if I am a young child on Christmas Eve. When announced that his new film, A Dangerous Method, had him working with Michael Fassbender and (for a third time) Viggo Mortensen, two of my favorite actors, as well as Keira Knightley and Vincent Cassel, I thought I must have been dreaming. Adding on that the film was going to be an exploration into the relationship between Carl Jung (portrayed by Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), the gods of psychoanalysis, and this had the makings for Cronenberg's masterpiece. So one can only begin to imagine my dismay when, after a promising first act, A Dangerous Method turned out to be the most inordinately tame and pedestrian Cronenberg film in over thirty years.",2012
9,"Have you ever witness a hysterical person having a crisis? I haven't, probably neither have you. Could that be the reason why to some reviewers (including myself) the histrionics of Keira Knightley as a hysterical patient were embarrassing to watch on the screen? I don' know. Probably real hysteria looks like that but in daily life a witness won't feel what a film viewer feels when being forced to watch incessantly all those facial and body contortions on close ups.",2012
6,"What was the source of conflict which caused a gulf to form between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung? When we examine their personal and professional lives, what turning points shaped their theories? What were the storms which blew through the lives of Jung and Sabina Spielrein? These are some of the questions this film attempts to highlight, and in fact begins to touch upon. ",2011
8,"Sabina Spielrein was one of the first female psychoanalysts, a fascinating achievement given the fact that she was committed to a mental institution for an entire year. After studying medicine and child psychology in Zurich, graduating in 1911, and getting elected into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, she proposed an idea in 1912, namely that the human sexual drive contained both an instinct of destruction and an instinct of transformation. Her death in 1942 at the hands of an SS death squad would all but erase her from the history books until her hospital records, journal entries, and letters to and from Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud were discovered and published; it's now widely accepted within psychiatric circles that her 1912 proposal greatly influenced the works of both men.",2011
8,"It's always difficult to review a movie based on psychology because sometimes what's difficult to understand is too easily categorized as illogical or bad execution.I heard so much criticism towards the last movie by Cronenberg.I completely disagree with those bad reactions.""A dangerous method""is a brilliant ,absorbing and thought provoking movie that boasts excellent performances by the three leading actors.The direction is great and Cronenberg once again shows his uncommon ability to tell a story in a very original way although the dialogs are sometimes hard to follow,probably due to its subject.But there are really breathtaking moments such as the scenes of the Spielrein therapy.This leads me to Knightley performance.It was a brave,shocking and terrific performance that it was criticized without a reason.I didn't catch all that hatred.She has always been so good(""Pride e prejudice"",""Atonement"" and ""Never let me go"")but here she left her comfort zone to bare herself and gives one of the most exiting performances of the year.Oscar worthy material.Fassbender was equally great in the role of Jung and it's a pleasure to watch this splendid rising A-list actor.Mortensen was good but I fear not as good as Fassbender and Knightley.Cassell is always Cassell.He's a good actor but he plays always the role of the daring man.I think that ""A dangerous method"" is one of the best movies of the year.It succeeds to transcend from his particular story to focus on the hidden instincts associated with the human nature.My vote is 8/10.",2011
8,"A Dangerous Method marks the third film that director David Cronenberg had collaborated with actor Viggo Mortensen, casting him as the famed Sigmund Freud in a tale that examines the relationship between three prominent scientists in the early days of psycho-analysis, with the other two being Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), set in the early 1900s, adapting from the play The Talking Cure by Christopher Hampton, which in turn was based on the non fiction book A Most Dangerous Method by John Kerr. ",2012
7,"Given his entire filmography is concerned with themes linked to man's identity and the complexities of human sexuality, David Cronenberg is, on paper at least, the ideal director for A Dangerous Method, a movie dealing with the birth of psychoanalysis. Then again, the film is also a bit of an odd fit for him, since the script by Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons) doesn't really lend itself to the outbursts of graphic violence that permeate the Canadian auteur's body of work. The result, first witnessed at the Venice Film Festival (after the film had allegedly been rejected by Cronenberg's fest of choice, Cannes), is an interesting but somewhat hollow entry in the director's admirable career.",2011
7,"Having just visited Freud's house in London only last week, it was lovely seeing his office and chair - I noticed the way Mortensen sat on it was correct - and as a graduate of psychology, this was a no-brainer to watch. I enjoyed it. It was less dark than I was expecting, more about the affair Jung had with his patient than actual psychoanalysis but it did highlight some interesting arguments in the field. It didn't really show Freudian and Jungian method in a great light, if all a novice had to go on was this film! Well acted by the principals Fassbender, Mortensen and Knightley although I do find Knightley's style of acting somewhat annoying generally. That said she had done her homework, and I found her depiction of the patient rather good - much has been made of her jutting jaw but I believe overt uncontrolled physical displays like that are common. Her accent didn't seem that bad to me - it wasn't overdone. I found this one of the best films I've seen her in and I felt that she was rather brave to take on such an emotionally laid bare role and she did with a great deal of commitment and success. Mortensen, I am more familiar in scenes running around with an elf, a dwarf and a hobbit, but he showed his prowess in this; I'm more familiar with Freud than Jung in terms of mannerisms, so felt he was pretty good he'd obviously studied the film archives and was made to look fairly similar. Fassbender was very measured and engaging as Jung and I really enjoyed his journey in the film and was divided on his choices. Cronenberg is a great director and this was a good example of his work; carefully researched and created scenes and vistas, script and score all worked well together. Other than one or two dubbing issues, and overly long time jumps, and a few gaps in narrative (for me) it was excellent. Excellent. Beautiful costumes. I liked the scenes in Freud's office with his couch (having seen it now in person) and I liked the reference to Egyptology that was thrown in, a pet subject of Freud.",2013
6,"A movie about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud directed by David Cronenberg? That sounds surprising and interesting, to say the very least but the movie as it turned out, was far from anything interesting to watch.",2012
5,"I can't remember the last time when I have been so much in disagreement with the general critical response for a movie Everywhere I look I seem to hear and read high praises for Cronenberg's latest work, and yet I am willing to bet that few of those who claimed to like it so much would be ready to watch it again. As far as I am concerned I am struggling to find something positive to say (well, yes, nice costumes) and the only reason why my vote isn't any lower is because I am willing to admit that I might have not been in the right mood for it. Even in his most flawed films, Cronenberg has always been an interesting director, or at least able to create not only an almost palpable atmosphere, but also a particularly defined style and vision which set him apart from the usual Hollywood crowd. And yet this one seems a film with no direction whatsoever. Not only each sequence felt random and inconsequential as if not necessarily edited in the right order, without any real feeling of natural progression from the previous one into the next, but also it was all so static and lifeless that sometimes I even wondered whether anyone was actually directing at all. At no point I felt any sympathy for any of the character: in fact, not only I did not like any of them, but I didn't even hate them either. I just didn't care. And this is is a rather strange thing to say, because on paper, a film about the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud (and consequently the birth of psychoanalysis) sounded to me very intriguing indeed. Sadly, pretty earlier on into ""A dangerous Method"" I realised that this wasn't really the type of film I was hoping to see. I found myself uneasy right from the word ""go"", that is from the moment I saw Keira Knightley overacting like never before and stretching her chin to new unbelievable levels, as if screaming to the audience ""I want that Oscar!!"". Well, darling, not this time. Then, after the early screams, it all calmed down a bit and the dialogue started and that's when it got worse! For a film which should rely on words more than action itself (especially given the static nature of it all), I found the script absolutely puerile. It all felt like it was written by a high school kid, who's just heard a few things about Freud and wants to impress his friend with his newly acquired knowledge. I mean, there are actually lines like ""You Freud, have always sex in your mind. Why does everything always has to do with sex?""! Really? Mr Hampton, who are you writing this script for? Surely your target audience doesn't need things spell out so boldly and blatantly. It was like reading a checklist of all the possible clichés one could think about psychoanalysis (and Freud in particular). Who is this film for anyway? At times it felt like it was so ridiculously basic, as if it was written for people who have never even heard of Freud and Jung. Other times it was all so riddled with heavy handed quotes and so ""up its own self"" that it felt like watching some boring lecture given by an even more bored teacher, sitting on your old desk back in school. From such a renowned scriptwriter (he wrote Dangerous Liaisons and Atonement among the other things) I was expecting a lot more: maybe Mr Hampton should watch a few episodes of HBO's classy ""In Treatment"" to learn a thing of two about the subtlety of bringing psychoanalysis to the screen. As far as the two leading male actors (Fassbender and Mortensen, who by the way was so good in both Cronenberg ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises""), they were as good as they could possibly be, but in the end they both failed to impress, move, or even raise any sort of emotion beyond boredom. But then again, that's hardly surprising given both the script they were actually given and a clear lack of any direction, which forced them to talk at each other in the most contrived scenes and badly staged, where even the extras in the background seemed fake and moved slowly and gently like ermwell, extras (particularly noticeable in the scene by the river). Sorry David, not this time for me",2011
9,"I would like to see director David Cronenberg still working in the horror genre which made him famous during the '70s and the '80s, but the truth is that his transition to the dramatic cinema has been brining very good results from the artistic point of view, even though not from the economical one. His film A Dangerous Method is a clear example...the subject is abstract and cerebral, the rhythm from the story is too slow in order to satisfy the requirements from commercial cinema, and even though this film could have been an intense romantic drama, Cronenberg decided to bring the film his habitual clinical coldness. The result is a film I liked very much, even though I perfectly understand the complaints some people had against it.",2012
4,"This movie is the most disappointing of the season. With an all star cast and concept I would have expected so much more. Fassbender's Jung is effeminate, weak, and easily led.Not an accurate portrayal. He lets the overacted Spirlein control his every thought. What the hell. This movie made no sense. Kiera Knightly is too beautiful and talented to be acting so simpering and unladylike. Even as a Sado-Masochist seductress she has no humanity to her just an animal selfish and seething. Viggo and Vincent are good but overshadowed by the bland misdirection of the rest of the cast.The movie just starts suddenly without any explanation, just a running start into psychosis without any atmospheric introduction. I can't explain the horror i felt when i discovered how vapid this plot was. There is no reasoning behind the actions of the characters than a psychology that is only shallowly described as Freud's baby. I'm so nauseated by this waste of time It's hard for me to continue writing. All i can i say is do not watch unless you want to be confused and disappointed and insulted. All this movie will do is insult your intelligence by exposing you to shallow, passive, stupid, childish excuses for a psychological thriller. an absolute bust.",2012
6,"I am a Cronenberg fan. I think a History of Violence is one of the greatest films ever made! I also think Eastern Promises showed what happens when a great Director pairs with an awesome muse. I anticipated this film eagerly but after watching it I was left with mixed feelings. Perhaps this is because the script was not as tight as that of the first two films I mentioned. It was never going to be easy capturing something as abstract as psychoanalysis on film, yet I can say that this film does ramble on at times and it is slow. A History of Violence was slow but the pay off was fantastic. Here there was no pay off. We were shown the lives of three great, complicated minds and that was it. After reading about the lives of the three central characters I can safely say that perhaps this was not the film Cronenberg should have made about Freud. He opted respectfully for the less dramatic and more factual and I think this sacrifice could have hurt what could have been another Cronenberg/Mortensen smash-hit. That said, I also think Keira Knightley was a mis-cast and Mortensen and Fassbender were as perfect as ever. Looking forward to the next Cronenberg flick. This wasn't awful but I expected more.",2012
7,"A number of reviewers and critics have already stated that the 2011 historical drama ""A Dangerous Method"" - about the birth of psychoanalysis in the beginning of the 20th century - was a film long in the making by its director, Canadian ""body horror"" master David Cronenberg.",2016
8,"Now I enjoyed Cronenberg's previous film ""Eastern Promises"" so I really looked forward to his latest work. Past ""Cronenberg"" films has psychological aspect to it, but this deals with some well known psychologist and the relationship between them which intrigued me even more. I thought this movie would revolve around the notorious psychologist Sigmund Freud who is the founder of psychoanalysis. But it revolves more around Carl Jung who is the founder of analytical psychology and his relationship with Sabina Spielrein, Sigmund Freud and Otto Gross. It was just interesting and engaging to watch these three well known psychologist that are interested in the human mind build relationships through what their main interest is. But if your looking for a detailed explanation of how some of them got to the point of there views on the human mind, you might be disappointed. It just shows bits and pieces of how Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein got to their views on the human mind. Carl Jung in this movie is portrayed as a character that acts righteous but does some hypocritical things. And Sigmund Freud is portrayed as someone that is very pedantic and egotistical about his theories of the human mind. So their approach is different in some areas. Carl Jung cadillac exterior phenomenon and deals with some spiritual aspects. But Sigmund Freud doesn't deal very well with sanctimonious Keira Knightley plays Sabina Spielrein, now some may agree or disagree but she had this theory of destruction and self destruction and how true sexuality comes from the destruction of the ego. I agree that Keira does seem to over act when trying to play crazy but when she becomes more calmer in this movie her acting really starts to shine. Michael Fassbender is good as Carl Jung and did a good job portraying his character that is infatuated with the human mind but also acts a bit naive sometimes. While Carl Jung is on his road to his discoveries, Sigmund Freud played by Viggo Mortensen is the scene stealer in this movie cause his acting is spot on. Proving he is a underrated versatile actor. Overall this is a intriguing movie that is worth seeing at least once, wasn't groundbreaking but it's a good movie that is more than just a love hate relationships kinda deal.",2012
8,"After reading the summary of this film, there was one thing that worried me about watching it. That was Keira Knightley. I know I'm in the minority here but, in my opinion, she has a tendency to overact, and when I can tell someone is acting, I'm unable to enjoy the movie, simply because the whole point of watching any movie is to enter into an alternate reality. Bad acting or overacting is probably the best way to kill the idea that such an alternative reality is possible. Reading the summary, and reading that Knightley was playing a hysterical woman, made me consider whether I should waste my time on this film. Now, I can't say that she didn't have her overacting moments, she did; however, she was believable enough and good enough to keep me involved. It should be said that this would be a difficult role for anyone to play. The other members of the cast, Michael Fassenbender and Viggo Mortensen, were well-suited to their roles of Jung and Freud, respectively. If I had one problem with the cast, it was with Sarah Gadon, who played Jung's wife. It was not her acting. She was, quite frankly, too attractive. You really have to suspend reality to believe that Jung could leave her for anyone.",2012
8,"I'm not particularly interested in Jung or Freud (although I have been to the Freud house in Vienna). I'm not a particular fan of any of the actors in this film. I am definitely not a Cronenburg fan. If I had known this was a Cronenburg film, I probably wouldn't have gone. ",2012
8,"I was ambivalent about seeing this film as I know so much about this story of Jung, Sabina and Freud that I can write a book about it myself. My fear was that they made some cheesy Hollywood-like version of the real story and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not the case. The meaning that the film conveys, in my view, is what the story was in reality-a paradox of how ethical violation and the trauma it caused Sabina co-existed with her healing, how two extraordinary men were so controlled by their egos that it didn't allow them to continue to collaborate, which slowed down the development of the whole field of psychoanalysis and how this woman (Sabina)was wiser and more enlightened than two of them combined. ",2011
8,"A Dangerous Method (2011) is a film about temptation and seduction; the breaking of professional etiquette; the falling out between two aging academics and the use of a 'Talking Cure' for people suffering from mental problems. Another poignant insight into the life of the soul from director David Cronenberg, who is no stranger to controversy and not afraid of exploring the perverse side of human nature. Abnormal animalistic behaviour, tormented psyches and sadomasochistic tendencies are all treated with his usual flair, tact, skill and sympathy.",2012
10,Thank you IMDb for finally give us a opportunity to rate the greatest revenge movie of all time.,2017
10,"This is the best Kill Bill version. Actually, it is a huge masterpiece.I have seen many movies, but this is the best of all. Kung Fu, ninja, samurai style,it reminds western. A heart-broken woman fighting for revenge and because of her lost child.The first feminist movie created by Q&U.The cast was brilliant. Quentin's directing changes was awesome. Soundtracks in perfect harmony.It is definitely a memorable movie with so much thrill and action.The best movie i have ever seen.All the cast was brilliant, i liked the martial arts style, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei and the plot. Tarantino is a very genius man and he knows how to make movies.",2017
7,"I used to be one of those fans who longed for the release of The Whole Bloody Affair. However, now that I have seen it, my desire to own it has been completely swept away. 
The first issue with the two films cut together is the length. Now some of my favorite movies are over 3 hours but this saga works better split in two. The 4 hour cut leaves no room for suspense and longing to start watching part 2. Another flaw is that after the house of blue leaves fight sequence, the last two hours are much less interesting for SOME viewers (not me really). 
The 2nd problem with the movie are the missing scenes and wonky edits. The scene I was most disappointed to find missing is the Bride's monologue at the beginning of part 2. This scene has been cut entirely and is replaced with a very awkward transition. Remember how the first film ends with the reveal that her daughter is still alive and then it brilliantly cuts to black, leaving the audience wanting more? Well this version cuts directly to Bill talking to Bud and throws the pacing off entirely.
The 3rd problem is the missing black and white scenes from the house of blue leaves sequence. The artistic and emotional choice to change the color makes the fight a little less interesting. Not only that, but a lot of the blood during that sequence is just water, because contrary to popular belief, they knew they were doing it in black and white. What we end up with is a fight scene that almost looks unfinished. 
There are a few new scenes added that I wish made it into the original cut, but they do not outweigh the cons of this cut. I recommend this only to die hard QT fans who are curious about this version of the film. I do not at all advise someone to watch this if it is their first time.
If you still can't find a copy online, don't stress on it. You are only missing out of a version of the film that simply isn't as good.",2018
9,"Another great by Tarantino, this time doing his version of a kung fu/revenge movie. The direction is spectacular as is normal for a Tarantino movie, and thankfully they combined both movies into one, ironically, the combination is the movie's biggest problem. The movie is just over 4 hours long, and the second half is 75% talking. The first half focuses more on action and backstory, but the second half slams on the brakes and goes to a crawl. Now granted, the talking is important, and does explain character's actions and personalities, but the two halves are night and day in that regard. The finale is over 40 minutes long, and all talking, it just doesn't feel like a Tarantino movie by the time the credits role. The movie didn't bore me though, it's just 30 minutes longer than it should be, in my opinion. The action's cheesy but also awesome, and Uma Thurman is great, the biggest negative is that the ending is a little too long.",2017
7,"OK the effects were great, the action was impressive....I mean visually, the movie was pretty good.",2011
6,"Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you're going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn't true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate ""I Am Number Four"". Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.",2011
6,"This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment. I also found myself un interested in the characters, apart from the dog, but who doesn't love a cute dog? It just seemed to be cliché after cliché after cliché. I have to remind myself I didn't go to watch shawshank redemption 2 or a William Shakespeare film adaptation. Instead I watched 90 odd minutes of blah. Good special effects and action sequences plus the added bonus of eye candy were just enough to save it. Just.",2011
4,"In a perfect world, the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso, the producing ""talent"" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? ",2011
5,"Based on the NY Times best-selling novel by ""Pittacus Lore"" (an alias for the memoir-fabricating James Frey and Jobie Hughes), I Am Four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing - albeit fairly unoriginal - concept.",2011
7,"This movie isn't the best action film of the year. This movie isn't another tongue-in-cheek teen movie. Most importantly, this movie isn't a ""wannabe"" of the Twilight franchise. This movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story, action, and desire to want more at the end. I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together, piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable. Seeing it behind-the-scenes, I couldn't imagine what it would look like. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.",2011
1,"If you liked the movie ""The Covenant"", which is about a teen coming into his super powers while falling in love with a brainy yet implausibly beautiful girl who spends most of the film standing agog at what he can do, then you probably will not like ""I Am Number Four"" for the simple reason that you are no longer a 13-year-old girl and this movie is almost a direct remake.",2011
9,"A great movie will leave you yearning for a sequel, and I Am Number Four certainly does. ",2011
1,"My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn't go with high expectations. I didn't expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action, good special effects and reasonable acting, but it didn't even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I'm not a teenager, which this film is aiming for (but even then it's so badly made even they shouldn't like this).",2011
8,"I was thinking this would be filler for a dull afternoon. Indeed it was but I was also surprised to find I really enjoyed it. We also had the pleasure of watching it on iMax so that makes just about anything a little better. If you want to enjoy the evening then go see this one. You'll see some good acting and decent new actors. Give it a chance and I think this might be the next good ""series"" of movies you'll like. I say series because they left this one wide open to find numbers 5, and 7-9. I can easily see a whole trilogy or more just waiting for this one to make enough money to get it going. Although without some decent advertising they aren't going to get that... :(",2011
1,"I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it's a free screening.

Not sure if I even care now that I've seen both ends of the spectrum.",2011
1,Seriously...I can't believe anybody (except maybe a dumb 10 yr old boy) to think this was a good movie. Everyone else is probably embarrassed by this movie even existing. If this is what the author wrote and published then the published world deserves to fail. this movie is that bad.,2011
5,"Of course, ""I Am Number Four"" is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.",2011
3,"I'll be honest here. I Am Number Four is a yawn. And when I'm not counting minutes till it's over, I'm snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines. Seriously, I haven't watched a movie with lamer lines since the Twilight series.",2011
9,Read some of the reviews on here so was unsure what to make of this. But loved the movie and was surprised how well it rolled. The special effects were superb as were the action scenes. Not sure why some slammed this movie but I have no problem giving this a 9. If your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business!,2015
8,"We loved I AM NUMBER FOUR. The storyline was good. Good love interest teen romance. Number Six is totally smoking sexy hot. Good strong female characters. The cast, acting, & special effects reminded me of Disney's Race to Witch Mountain which we also enjoyed. ",2011
7,"I was lucky and saw an advanced screening on this film and I was half disappointed and half impressed. First of all, I read the book and I just thought that they left out a lot of detail from the book, some big ones too. But, the visuals and action is what kept me on my seat. The story, I thought they did a decent job with, but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book, it would have been a better film. They could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book. I mean, in the book, Henri and John can open the chest he hides together. They open it in the book, and Henri lays John down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet, Lorien, and with that, Henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens, visually. They could have put that part in the movie, I thought it was a somewhat big part. But overall, a decent flick if you have nothing else to do or see. Check it out, I Am Number Four!",2011
7,"Watched the movie ""I am number four"" tonight. The first 40 minutes it felt like I was watching a re-hashed ""Twilight"" movie rather than a sci-fi/horror pic. But then it got good. It was well worth the watch if you can make it through that first half of beaten to death formula high school angst movies that Twilight has seemed to spawn. You can bet that there will be sequels too, but they may be straight to video. The first half of the movie I give it 1 star, but it was the fault of the story, not the acting. The second half, I give it 8 stars. The acting was good, there were very nice special effects and some pretty cool alien bad guys in the style of ""Pinhead.""",2011
8,"This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror, a sci-fi, or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller, though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally dark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually, a lot of films with the sci-fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies, and the only reason that they are sci-fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that sci-fi is not actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since most sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though it is probably better classified as epic).",2012
1,"This movie actually has an interesting story, a not entirely, but at least partly original idea. It should be a good movie about aliens hunting down other aliens on earthly settings. Well its not a good movie AT ALL. Oh boy is this one baaad...., this made me really angry... First of all, the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression: the ""I am messed up""-look, the ""I am angry""-look and don't forget the ""awww I am totally like a cute puppy, are you girls feeling hawt already?""-look and that's about it. Not just the actor, but the character is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor, a teen from another planet, who is super-duper strong and one of the last of his kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he have a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the same race, which destroyed his home, is out to kill him, does he listen to his mentor's advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining, that he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of outer-space assassins are out to kill you, and they already killed almost every single one of your race, don't you have more pressing matters, than go to school and try to be the ""kool"" jet-sky flipping kid?.... For example, like... I don't know...Planning to escape the situation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on, that's not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the UFO go to high school and jet-sky, because he is so hawt......So he shall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirl-service. Go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this, but this is PATHETIC. Oh and if you want to make another crappy ""nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy"" its okay, fine by me, BUT don't LIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an action packed sci-fi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen to god awful dialoge about odd-girls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with odd-girls parents having little family dinners with UFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these holly-jolly pink teenage love stories, please don't try to force them down on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens (good and bad alike) were, or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue I heard in years, or how stupid it is that after UFO boys little light-show on the beach or in the class-room nobody really cared. In reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a party, well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the news for days...

You would get more out of it, seeing this in 3D. I was outnumbered in the Palace Ezi Max Cinema, a vast one. April 19th, 2011. I couldn't believe it. I was thinking 'If only I had my non Asian friend with me"". I'm the only Aussie in this packed cinema of Asian folk. Some brought in some wine, to mark this auspicious occasion. There have been three other Sex and Zen films prior, all coming out consecutively in the mid nineties on. So this one is refreshing, but it had me so thinking this stories similar to the others, but really this sex flick, takes away from the story, when you have luscious stark lovelies engrossed in intercourse or sex acts where some bouncing boobs are coming at you. There are some memorable scenes: not so, that gigantic squashed c..k that really looks like a c..k, (a scary thing) the couple of scenes and dialogue following this, hilarious, the funniest in this flick. There are our lead couple I think, having intercourse on a giant curved, stone statue'd c..k (yeah really) and maggots foot disease, some great towering shots of a fortress, and 45 degrees slicing and dicing (great in 3D). The last scene, the most potent, beautiful too, thus bring disappointment as the end credits start to roll. These out there films, and I'm not just talking the Sex And Zen series, too me are just films to get off, where we do neglect the story that goes into it. With these Sex An Zen films, we really have to pay attention to the story as we get lost or deviate from, as these colorful, stark and nubile beauties are in our faces, visually pleasuring us with their goodies.

However, I convinced myself to sit through it until the end no matter  what.  It was horrible.  I mean, no matter how abstract a movie is, there must be something the  viewer can cling to, something the viewer cares about. This movie has  nothing like that.   The funny thing is, the set-up is fairly quick: in 10 minutes you know  what the deal is. Sean Penn is a middle-aged man reflecting on the  meaning of life and reminiscing on his somewhat estranged relationship  with his father (Brad Pitt) and the loss of his brother in the Vietnam  war. After those 10 minutes, nothing that happens in the movie changes  that. There's just no development, it s a bunch of short cuts  (honestly, the longest cut might be 10 seconds long) showing the family  life in the 1950s (very much like home movies) mixed with images of  space, Earth in its beginnings, dinosaurs (I'm not kidding) etc.  It beggars belief that the crummy hacks out there calling themselves  critics say this movie is a ""masterpiece"" and draws comparison with  Kubrick's 2001. Is it because of the slow pace and special effects?  Kubrick used those for a reason: to tell a story, to help advance the  plot and create a sense of expectation and/or suspense. The Tree of  Life is nothing like that, because there's simply no plot. You don't  know who to root for or sympathize with. There's no hero, no challenge,  no arc. It's just a 2 1/2 hour collage of short scenes. I saw several  people leaving the room after just 15 minutes of projection; others  kept checking their watches every few minutes (myself included.)  It's a pity really, because the performances are quite good,  particularly the kids in the 1950s sequence and Brad Pitt as the stern  father discharging his career frustrations on the wife and kids. Sean  Penn is there too, but he's useless: the director gives him nothing to  do, so he just makes ugly faces at the camera as if he's suffering from  terrible heartburn.  In short: save your money.",2011

1,"One of the most pretentious pieces of pseudo-intellectual garbage I have ever seen. The photography is great, however that is not what a film is about. The whole film turns around a guy and his relation with is father and the burden of his brother's death. really simple story, with no need for mental masturbation over two and one half hours. I'm willing to bet that in the near future no one will ever remember this film. This film gathered another award: my life's greatest cinematic disappointment. Cannes' boys are lowering their standards, I think. Instead of this i suggest you guys rent ""the fountain"" because it has far better photography and a much, much nicer story.

1,"After seeing this movie, I sincerely cannot comprehend all the hype and the excellent reviews that it has attracted. The only way I can explain such good reviews is that whoever wrote them have either been generously paid to do so or were high on dope while doing so. This was the first time ever I have felt so angry about wasting my time and money watching a bad movie. The only reason the movie may have attracted so much attention is the fact that Brad Pitt and Sean Penn were acting in it. However, I felt that their talents were completely wasted on one of the most pointless and most boring movies I've ever seen.",2011
10,"The first thing to say about 'The Tree of Life' is that it is ESSENTIAL VIEWING for anyone who believes that the cinema is a great art, and an early front-runner for 'Film of the Decade'. I first heard about this project in the early 80s when the film world was awash with rumours that Malick had a project that was 'Cosmic, too cosmic even for Hollywood' (John Sayles). And, being a number one fan of Malick's magical realism, I have been metaphorically holding my breath ever since. ",2011

9,"Greetings again from the darkness. Rare are the times that I find myself lacking words to express my opinion on a movie just watched. But writer/director Terrence Malick does not play fair. First of all, what director makes five films in 40 years? Who makes a film about CREATION, life, evolution, spirituality, death and existence? What director seems to thrive when no real story is needed to make his points? Which director can so mess with the viewer's head through visual artistry never before seen on screen? The answer to these questions, of course, is Terrence Malick. And I hold him responsible the fact that I remain in somewhat of a semi-conscious fog four days after watching his latest masterpiece.",2011

10,"Unlike a novel the stories in this movie do not unfold, revelation following revelation, culminating in a definable message or theme. There is no moral, no hero, no emotional epiphanies. What it presents is an extraordinarily haunting vision of childhood, how the things we love the most are as fragile as morning dew yet immensely powerful. The things that connect us, separate us, and bewilder us - again and again and again throughout our lives. The saddest, most insightful, most poignant portrayal of a family I have ever seen. Genius. How can this film achieve commercial success? it seems impossible. How did a film so ambitious get made when everything that makes money today is everything this film isn't? Bravo to the producers, bravo to the early critics who are stepping up and speaking out for this deeply moving masterpiece.",2011

And those hundreds of hammerhead sharks, are they supposed to represent the greedy rich? ",2011
10,"Just going to say a few of the regular things before I get into it. Yes, this is not your tradition blockbuster. A lot of people who normally wouldn't see this movie did because of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. It's a non-traditional narrative. Terrifying, I know.",2013

10,"The film is already part of my subconscious. The pungent focus on a microscopic nucleus is as powerful as it is recognizable. The film renewed my love for film in one single viewing. It s a profoundly religious experience without being ""fundamentalist"" in any way. An artist's view made of distant memories who live in a permanent present. Brad Pitt is astonishing. That Irish-American, Catholic father from the 1950's is an X ray into something we've never seen, not on film that is. He arrives to levels of unimaginable clarity with very few words. It reminded of my father talking about his own father. I wept like a child. Jessica Chastain is also superb and the children, quite extraordinary. I can't wait to see it again.",2011
9,"To start off, if this is not the most beautiful film ever shot, is very high on the list. Every single shot in this entire film had my eyes glued onto it and my jaw dropped a few times. The story was confusing at parts, but a lot of the people who have negative feelings toward the film came in expecting a very upfront the story. The story is extremely compelling despite the way parts are told. It's simply the story of a boy falling from his grace, and becoming more like his father, even though he doe not understand why entirely. The film does an excellent job capturing the confusion and the discomfort in growing up, for example in the scene in which they send the frog on a firework. Obviously, not everyone did this exact thing, but it shows the way that the character is trying to find his way in the world and learn who he is. Not only was the story very compelling, but the score was incredible. Between the combination of the music and the shots, this movie was extremely intriguing and fascinating to watch. I give this movie a solid 9.2 out of ten.",2012
8,"The Tree of Life is the latest film by reclusive director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) whose previous films displayed a simple narrative abetted by haunting imagery.

Large swaths of this movie are like watching a stranger's home movies. This is about a family who can't get past their own pain, whether it's large or small. It suggests that there really is no meaning to our suffering though we think there is. But I don't need a 2.5 hour movie with pretensions of grandeur to tell me this. Sean Penn stepping through a door frame in the desert. Gee, that's deep. Spend time with your actual family rather than watch this film.",2011
1,"Many movies have gone down in history as pushing the envelope, changing the way critics and audiences perceive movie making as a whole. Citizen Kane, Psycho and A Clockwork Orange are only a few to raise the bar on how effective a film can be on a viewer. Sometimes those filmmakers go down in history as visionaries, decorated time and again by journalists, historians and movie fans alike, but pushing the envelope can also bring about the opposite reaction. Every now what comes along is something that few understand and even fewer care to try. For the reclusive director, Terrence Malick, he doesn't seem to care which category he falls in and maybe that's the best way to play it. He makes his movies as a personal statement and they represent exactly what he wants to say, never mind what people want to hear. Lofty and admirable as that outlook may be, it can make for an incredibly risky movie-going experience. There are already heated words being tossed all over blogs and movie sites everywhere, so here's my two cents in the debate.",2011
4,"Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life,"" is a pretentious slide show of cosmic post-cards, with a story in the middle. This animated power-point reuses unashamedly the worst clichés of TV commercials (think of a two hours advertisement for a life insurance), and the most lurid scenes of Discovery Channel's documentaries. Malick resorts to an exquisite photography to illustrate embarrassing platitudes, and this experience is particularly unpleasant for the spectator. Malick's attempt is very ambitious, and he should be praised for that. Two movies written in a similar phenomenological vein come to my mind: Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovski's Zerkalo. The last two movies, however, were balanced and perfectly executed. Alas, Malick's movie is redundant, heavy, sententious, excessive and sometimes even obscene, but not hopeless. For this lack of decorum ultimately depends on the editing, and Malick could drastically improve this movie if he remembered that the force of poetic forms relies on economy of language.",2011

I just can't wait for it. I love the men in this show, they just do such a great job, don't get me wrong, so do the women. This show is pretty much about a high school girl named Jenna. She receives a note saying some very horrible things, and then everyone thinks she tried to kill herself, which she didn't.

I have to make this longer so ill go into how i enjoy the realistic language used in the show. They used cursing how it would really be used in conversation instead of some 70 year old writer trying to through the F word into a teen conversation and not knowing where to start.

If there was a word to top the word amazing, that is what the show would be.

Well if that's how teenagers should act then this only confirms why I don't like children and why I don't want any. The first seasons were okay when the main character Jenna Hamilton was the unpopular girl. Then it was watchable, but after she lost her virginity to the high school jock and her only reason to live was having sex then it quickly went downwards until it became unwatchable.

8,"First season was good and I got impression that this was going to be something original & interesting. Sadly after 2nd season I started to dislike the heroine and it seemed like she was an emotional mess with questionable moral standards. Other characters stayed rather true to themselves but I didn't know where the heck the Jenna Hamilton character was going. She was all over the place and changed her mind about loving someone almost daily. A good portion of the series Jenna was twitching her face all the time while thinking her relationship with Matty. In the beginning it had seemed cute but started to annoy a lot when the supposed strong leading female character was insecure as hell. Someone should have counted how many times Jenna & Matty fell of the wagon & back to loving each other throughout the series. It was ridiculous and ruined seasons 3, 4 and 5 completely and even in the end there was not a happy ending. I was left wondering if this character goes through her life questioning everything. Never settling and never actually having a meaningful long relationship. And she was supposed to be the smart one of the group. Maybe the writers tried to create sex and the city for teens. Or maybe Jenna was what writers want to be or are. It definitely wasn't what viewers want to see & what would be smart to write. So this series goes to the bin with other ""too many seasons with nothing to tell"" and ""cant write a decent ending even if my life depended on it"". I liked, with serious intention not to, Jenna's friends Tamara, Lissa, Sadie and Jake, Valerie, Ally & Sergio most. Especially Sadie, Valerie & Ally were great characters.",2016

But, Payne displays--in this touching and very real movie--the same incredible talent for doing two things better than almost every other movie maker (at least as far as I'm concerned): 1) he brings the viewer into the geography and milieu of the time and place in a gritty way that clearly presents the natural beauty of the area without over-romanticizing it and 2) he fits the characters into this environment and achieves a reality for these people that transcends the 2-dimensional characters that populate the multiplexes. You really care about these people.",2011
10,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and that's judging it from what it is. I became a fan of A P after watching Sideways and ended up reading the book before watching the movie. I think the biggest problem people have with this movie is that it's not the typical ""HOLLYWOOD"" movie that forces ""emotion"" down our throat nor is it the typical ""INDIE"" film with shaky cameras, far out one shots and so on. It's simple, a bit plain, and raw. We're presented with characters that may not seem interesting at first look, but when it comes down to it, AP has once again showed us a reflection of ourselves and people we know around us. We're normal. We're not all flashy people with cool lives and have interesting personalities. Some people just ARE and live that way. I recently lost the person who would have been my mother in law. I'm twenty four, and my girlfriend is twenty two, and her little sister is fourteen. My girlfriend has recently taken custody over her sister, and with their father passing away before the little sister was born, I've found myself in a bit of a father role and it's scary and new and very strange at times. I completely related to Clooney's character right away, and could feel the frustration he felt, and the emotions he felt. I think he did well with dealing with them. It felt real to me. In fact, everyone's emotions toward the tragedy the film presents felt very real. I saw those same reactions from sisters, aunties, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers. Some blamed others while others completely lost it. Some felt mad, while others just cried and broke down. Some were oblivious to the news(like the grand mother in the movie) while others were simply there to comfort(Sid). I really appreciated the entire movie, scenery, and dialogue(and at times lack there of). I really enjoyed the frustration they felt one minute, the humor the next, and the forgetfulness of the tragedy at times. It was like seeing a movie based on what my girlfriend and I were going through, and it felt comforting that someone had captured that so well. Not every tragedy will be filled with a room full of criers. Some might. Not all we be filled with humor and relief. Some will. For us, it was everything. It didn't seem real, and at times, it seemed dull. This movie has a special way of presenting itself in that manner and I really liked it. I'm sure not everyone will like. Either they're use to super hero action movies, horror movies, or stuff like Twilight. Maybe you are into good dramas and indie flicks and for whatever reason you didn't connect with that one. For me, a person who's just lived through it and am discovering to be a dad type to someone I'm still getting to knowit was simple, perfect.",2012

George Clooney's Matt King is, quite simply, superb. The humanity of the man mingling with his contradictions. So refreshing to spend time with this immediately recognizable man. I couldn't help but loving him. If it's true that Clooney dominates the film, he is surrounded by compelling characters. His eldest daughter, played by the remarkable Shailene Woodley for instance or her boyfriend, a winning Nick Krause, contribute to make ""The Descendants"" one of the best films of 2011.",2011
5,"SPOILER ALERT (It's way at the bottom and MARKED). Clooney is stiff as a plank in this overlong, unsatisfactory drama. The first hint you get is the opening with heavy-handed narration. Narration is always a bad sign. The movie simply PLODS onward from that inauspicious beginning. While the movie does avoid the soap-opera aspects of the story, it betrays its only interesting character. Here's the SPOILER: I'm talking about Syd, the glib, prize-jackass boyfriend of the unstable/semi-druggie older daughter. The dope who thinks granny's Alzheimer's is funny. Everybody grows up a little in this story (except, I guess, the younger daughter, who's a cipher--just there for others to worry about) but the one who grows up most and most unexpectedly is Syd. So much so that in fact, in a late scene at the hospital, where Clooney is being unfairly jumped on, Syd is the FIRST to stand up for him. This character development creeps up on you because a) it's subtle and b) there ain't much else, but it's the stand-out of the film. Apart from that, the script MAKES him important: there's a protracted if unbelievable scene in which Clooney has a late-night 'what would you do in my shoes?' heart-to-heart talk with him alone. Yet after all that the script just dumps him. Not even dumps him--that would require some action of some sort. He's just completely omitted from the climactic scenes, as if he never existed. And so this is an utterly unmemorable movie. Six months from now even its fans will struggle to remember it.",2012

I just can't believe the rating and the accolades this movie is getting by the admitted majority of commenters here. The scene where Clooney ""ran"" to confront his neighbor's about concealing his wife's affair was lamentable.

The obvious choice was the descendants... Or was it? I had heard nothing about the film before sitting down to watch it, open minded I watched the trailers and then the beautiful opening shots of scenery... Then Clooney's voice over kicked in. Essentially it only goes down hill from there as cliché'd character after cliché'd character crawl out of the woodwork, Clooney himself doing an admirable impression of someone who is quite frankly emotionally retarded and completely transparent as an actor.",2012
4,This movie should be sued for false advertising! They are selling it as a warm and fuzzy feel good comedy. It is not. There are a few (very few) funny moments. ,2011
9,"My only regret about this movie is that it took me this long to see it. The Descendants, is one of those films that fully succeeds at what it is trying to accomplish. George Clooney fully engulfs himself into the character of Matt King, and his emotional range sways from moments of pure pleasure to those of betrayal and discomfort. Clooney's spectacular and award winning performance is only outdone by Alexander Payne's ability to portray a beautiful slice of heaven in Hawaii while at the same time breaking the viewers heart with devastating character developments and scenes that will undoubtedly have an emotionally conscious viewer on the verge of tears. Even the brief supporting roles of Beau Bridges, Matthew Lilliard, and Judy Greer feel so real and intense that at times it felt like I wasn't watching a film at all, but rather the lives of several individuals in some of their most vulnerable moments. To put it simply, Clooney gives a knockout performance and the Descendants is surely one the most outstanding films of the year. If I had to choose one, this would have to be my choice for the Best Picture of 2011. A+",2012
1,"I feel like the little boy who shouted to the crowd ""the emperor has no clothes!"" This film was tedious in the extreme, pointless in its storyline and bereft of any real emotional content. I found myself thinking at the end ""so what?"" I found nothing about the characters either likable or interesting and indeed for me every single performance bar one was utterly one dimensional. Cloony was boring and the younger cast simply flat and dissatisfying. The only exception to that was Elizabeth King, the one in bed. It must be a bad year for films if this is up for getting awards. It left me with the feeling that you get when you eat one of those meals that just does not agree with you and sits on your stomach like a lead weight. This film was a lead weight from start to finish and I left the cinema untouched, unmoved and unrewarded by the entire experience. Am I really the only one in the crowd that saw this film for what it was? trite and abysmal?",2012
3,The Descendants has one and a half stories. One that barely goes anywhere and half a story that goes nowhere. We are led to believe that the half a story is the significant one but there is no reason for that. I'll tell about this movie from the perspective of the actual story.,2012
1,I was really disappointed by this movie. It won a Golden Globe and is nominated for an Oscar so I thought it would at least be entertaining. It's unbelievable plot seems like it was created solely to make George Clooney look like a good person.,2012
1,"It is disappointing that this film has received such high ratings. After all, this is what drew me to go out and see it myself. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely an audience who would appreciate this film. In my opinion, however, it definitely lacks any kind of spark that would lead my to recommend it to anyone.",2011
1,"So my wife is in a death coma and my teenage daughter tells me she is a tramp or a fool or both. Now it becomes my mission in life to find my wife's lover so that he can say,""goodbye""? Oh ya, and my daughter tags along on my mission.",2011
1,"This is by far the worst Clooney movie I've seen yet!,and there has been many!!! It was so boring within the first 45 minutes I kept falling asleep. Ralph and I walked out...the manager gave us back our money. Clooney had no emotions, no expressions, no nothing. All he did was just read the script....he acted like he did not even want to be in this movie. The agony of trying to keep awake in this movie was just too hard for us to take. The manager of the movie theater said that this is the general response he is getting from others....he does not want to see this movie either. I cannot believe Clooney is up for an award, except for worst actor and worst picture! George looks very tired in this picture....I do believe he found it hard to keep awake also, his age is beginning to show. The Ides of March...thank goodness Ryan Gosling took the lead in this picture. Also, the writers for this movie.....I don't know what they were thinking....very poor writing.",2011
10,"I think Austin & Ally is super amazing for a Disney show. Its dialogues are hilarious. Each character is an individual. Austin is a performer and you can see that Ross Lynch feels good on the stage. He doesn't need to act, he feels the moves. A lot of people are pointing out, that he is playing hot guy that is not hot. His cheeky smile is adorable, I don't think he is meant to be hot. He is meant to be cute. Ally is adorable and dorky character that reminds me of Zooey Deschanel's character Jess from FOX's New Girl. Very adorkable. Austin and Ally's chemistry is beyond amazing. They remind me of Brennan and Booth on Bones or Castle and Beckett on Castle as teenagers. Trish and Dez are the funny duo, reminding me of Scooby Doo characters. Dez would pull a pretty good Shaggy. I find it much more enjoyable show then was Hannah Montana or Wizards of Waverly Place. Those ones were just boring, comparing to Austin & Ally.",2013
10,"Austin & Ally is a great show for children and teens alike, combining the fun and silliness of the characters kids like, the romantic relationships teens like and music - something everyone can enjoy.",2013
7,"With ""Austin & Ally"", Disney Channel has made yet another sitcom in line which centers about a teen who becomes a famous musician. Which means that a normal kid can live a normal life, while being a popstar at the same time. Of course, by watching those shows it means that you'll have to let pass some illogical notions. And yes, an immediate comparison is of course the much hyped ""Hannah Montana"" and though of course ""Austin & Ally"" isn't a carbon copy, it borrows many components and story lines from ""Montana"" in a obvious and overt way. In the last years, Disney Channel has been desperate to cash in on their stars and have made most of their shows and TV movies as big, cultural phenomenon's (""High School Musical"", ""Hannah Montana"", ""Wizards of Waverly Place and ""Camp Rock"" come to mind). I'll confess those shows have been a guilty pleasure of mine. But there's no denial they're glossy products, aiming just for kids, which is even more evident on the current DC shows. ""Austin & Ally"" is still a fine exception. While it doesn't bring back to the glory days of DC sitcoms and it's not absent of flaws, it's still one of the better shows from Disney Channel and is better than shows as ""Shake it Up"" and ""A.N.T. Farm"".",2013
10,"I love the whole plot and characters. The story is about a songwriter who has stage fright and a singer who can't write songs. I love how they are opposites but they work together to form a great team. Ally is the shy songwriter who is a neat and nervous person while Austin the singer who can't write is messy and composed. Dez is the film director who is crazy and wacky but very lovable. Trish is Ally's best friend and Austin's manager, she always gets fired at every job she gets which is a very funny recurring comedic act. Ally and Austin's relationship is from platonic to something more, it is unknown but they do show some signs of attractions towards each other. Each of them are unique and different but together they are all great friends towards each other. I do feel that they should have a lot more seasons to come. All in all this is a great show to watch filled with laughs and friendship.",2012
7,"Disney's newest venture into the sitcom/music market is ""Austin & Ally"", a show about a teen songwriter (with extremely bad stage fright), and an aspiring musician (who needs help writing songs). What a perfect match. Although they don't always get along, Austin and Ally end up working together. Although I do believe the golden age of Disney Channel (High School Musical, Hannah, Jonas, Camp Rock, Wizards) is ending, I believe Austin & Ally gives the new DC some hope. The new DC shows now try to hard, such as shoving China McClain down our throats with her mediocre singles. Shake it Up, although decent, gets tiresome. And Jessie is boring, clearly showing us Disney did not strike lightening with Debby Ryan being the new ""It Girl."" However, I feel as if Austin & Ally can bring Disney in a new direction, while still staying true to their song and dance formula that has been working (has been, I repeat). Instead of trying so desperately to create the new Miley, DC can put a lot of promotion into Ross Lynch (Austin), much like their attention to the Jonas Brothers a few years ago. Nothing sells better than a heart throb, and Ross Lynch is likable, attractive, and can sell crowds of 6-12 year old girls. The writing is surprisingly good for a DC show, although it is still campy, cheesy, and over the top. The chemistry between Austin and Ally can also be much better, I feel as if the actors are not truly aware of their character yet. But these are early episodes, most kid shows progress over time (A.N.T. Farm, Victorious). Not every DC show is going to compare to HM and their will not be another star like Miley for years to come. Disney has to understand this, and move on to the next thing. Instead of trying to create little pop starlets, they should shift their direction on a guy and hopefully Austin & Ally makes progress in acting and writing.",2011
1,**VERY STRONG SPOILERS ABOUT THE PLOT AND THE CHARACTERS**,2014
2,"I don't get it. There are SO many things wrong with this show. Yes, i know it is a kid show and i am not a kid. Although, i would never let my kids watch this brain rotting trash. Apparently, Austin roams the mall and the beach with his friends, WITHOUT BEING ATTACKED BY FANS AND PAPARAZZI?! It makes no sense. This show tells kids that you can follow your dreams so easily! Yay! I'm famous and don't have a care in the world! Also, Disney has a retarded record of bad jokes played in all their shows. Not once have i laughed, or my daughter! Austin thinks he's so cool and fresh.. ( HE IS NOT!!!!) And by the way, he's so awful that playing for the PRESIDENT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. HE HAS NO TIME 4 THAT! Trish gets a different job every day although hates working. If you hate working so much, why not quit for a few months?! And my least favorite episode is when they hire Keira, ( the one with the smelly breath) and are afraid to hurt her feelings, rather than just quickly handing her a mint and getting back to work. But NOO! They had to go and make a whole episode out of it. There is always no lesson in these. They are: - Not humorous ",2014
1,"First, let me just say this show just like most Disney shows today is so unoriginal it kills me. I feel bad for these actors who have to work for such terrible creators and writers. The creators aren't the only ones to blame though. These so called ""actors"" wouldn't know good acting if it hit them in the face. ",2014
10,"I am prone to liking Disney Channel shows. However, other than Good Luck Charlie lately they seem to be going downhill.. And now that i'm older the jokes have gotten old too. So, i was wary that this show would be corny and lame, but decided to check it out just in case(plus I really love bright blond hair on guys(Austin aka Ross Lynch)..just sayin haha).And to my surprise this show has gotten Disney back on track! With good original songs and likable characters, Austin and Ally could really be a hit. I am really looking forward to more episodes, even my brother likes this show and he never does, again, except for Good Luck Charlie. SO i recommend giving this show a chance, you won't regret it.",2011
10,"At first, when Disney was showing the trailer and promos for Austin and Ally, I was thinking ""eeesh! another lame, not funny, predictable, unsuccessful show!"" I was thinking that because of all the new shows on Disney which did not amuse me well such as ""A.N.T Farm"" and ""So Random"". (Shows like ""Jessie"" and ""Shake It Up"" and ""Good Luck Charlie"" were watchable however and okay.)",2012
1,"The fact that this show was even made, makes me weep for humanity. It's like Nicki minaj, popular with morons, The fact that this show gets a rating of 5 is awful. The show has jokes that fall flat all the time.",2013
1,"WARNING: SPOILERS This is the exact type of show that proves the human race is going downhill fast. How does this unoriginal, cliché, Disney Channel trash have a 6.0 rating? Austin is my least favorite character in television history. He thinks he is the greatest thing since sliced bread and always tries to impress girls, who rightfully turn his ugly, stupid ass down most of the time. He doesn't play guitar, he just runs around while flapping his hand and his singing is like listening to nails on a chalkboard, plus the sound of boiling water in a teapot.",2015
1,I was really not excited about Austin and Ally coming out because of the stupid jokes on the advertisement. When I saw the first episode I laughed at it but not because it was funny trust me it wasn't I was laughing because it was so bad it was actually hilarious,2012
6,"I had hopes for Austin and Ally; this show was not bad but could have been much better. The show is about a songwriter, Ally Dawson, and a singer, Austin Moon. Ally has stage fright and Austin loves to be on stage but can't write songs. So they team up; seems like the perfect match, right? I have to be honest that this show's writing is not bad. Though the writing could still improve. The show is very cheesy and really irritates me. Sometimes the writing would be like the writing of a show my baby cousin would watch. The show tries to hard to be funny when it is not. Dez, Austin's friend is always doing something random related to nothing in the show and the creators thinks that it is funny. Well it is not and just makes the show more of a bore. Though, some parts are actually funny. One part that was actually funny was when Austin hurt his foot and Dez offered acupuncture to help. The acting could be a little better. When one of them is trying to keep a secret from each other, I just turn off the T.V. The characters make it so obvious that they are hiding a secret. I wonder what is going on in the creators head! Here are the characters: Austin: Austin is the guy who wants to be a famous singer but yet acts like a 10 year old and only hangs out with three friends.",2013
6,"The latest D-Com show rolling off the assembly lines at the Magic Kingdom is Austin&Ally in which a would be teen bubble gum idol kind of plagiarizes a song from a girl who writes well, but has incredible stage fright. They seem to be a natural combination, but having seen the first two episodes which reflect real life somewhat in that finding one's muse for creativity will be a major plot component for many episodes. As Richard Rodgers once said, 'melodies don't come to me, I go to them'. I think that Laura Marano's character of Ally would agree with that.",2011
1,"I hate this show! the characters are boring the songs in every episode sucks it made me cry when i saw the first commercial i thought it would be pretty good its not! 1.Austin is immature,he cant write a good song,he's an idiot like Dez.",2013
5,"Now many people say this show is pretty good, but I kind of have to disagree. Like, Trish is overly selfish and annoying. Also, Dez is alway ruining everything! Austin is pretty cool, but I hate how he falls in love with Ally. Poor Ally is always getting insulted on how ""boring"" she is, especially by Dez. It was pretty good at first, but it started getting really boring and stupid. The jokes are lame. Although I will say these actors, although not the best, are pretty good! It's sorta good, but the characters personalities ruin it. And Kira, she can't even sing, then she becomes a singer. Like, really? Also, there's random Bruno Mars concerts, or Katy Perry concerts, and does that really happen in Miami? Jimmy Star gets on my nerves too. I'm not sure why, but he just does! That's what I think about the show",2013
8,"I'd give it a 10 if it wasn't for the feud between Dez and Chuck because it makes the show a little unrealistic although their slap-talk can be very funny at times. I'm very impressed with the progress not only of the show but with the actors as well, especially Ross Lynch. On the first season Ally was dorky and very funny (she was the main reason I liked the show), Dez was overly stupid, Austin was just okay and Trish had been always funny. The show started taking a spin that got my attention towards the end of season 1. By season 2, I wouldn't miss an episode. Suddenly, Ally's style is less dorky yet she still has that cheesy personality that I love, Dez is actually making me laugh and Austin, wow! He turns into a true star. That last episode of season 2 made me cry (Ross Lynch...wow!), they did an incredible job. I look forward to watching Austin and Ally every Sunday evening and I do the Ally dance when I'm happy. The show keeps getting better and better and I can't wait for season 3. I like good shows like this one, that the whole family can enjoy. Now that Good Luck Charlie is coming to an end, we need good show or shows that can step it up like Dog with a Blog and this one, my very favorite...Austin and Ally! Let's take it to season 4 please!",2013
10,"I absolutely loved watching Austin and Ally. It became one of my favorite shows and I had everyone in the house enjoying it with me. Dez is such a funny person. Him and Austin always seemed to get into trouble. Ally makes me laugh so much when she dances and she shows that you don't have to care about what anyone thinks. Be true to you. Trish had so many jobs it was amazing, are kids even allowed to work as much as she did? Overall, I just love this show!!!",2017
5,"Six words: They dragged it out too long. The show started out decent enough, a little predictable at times, as most youth TV shows are, but decent nonetheless. Eventually they started wrapping up all of the ""conflicts"" throughout the seasons, i.e.. Ally's stage fright, Austin and Ally's undying love for one another, Ally leaving her friends for college, blah, blah, blah, etc, etc. but eventually they just ran out of ideas and began spewing nonsense onto the screen which resulted in complete garbage that I immediately change channels from. Towards the end of the series' run the episode plots became ridiculous, causing me to ask the creators of the show a slew of questions: -how is that even a real issue? -in real life when have you seen a legit person act/talk/think/dress this way? ever? -were you playing the ""how many clichés can I fit into one series"" game? -did we just forget about ally's gorilla researching mom, who was low-key cool forreal, and continue to deal with her boring cliché dad? -why did you have to ruin the last half decent show on Disney channel?",2016
1,"This is a horrible show. I really miss the old Disney like that's so raven, wizards of Waverly place, Hannah Montana, Sonny with a chance, and The suite life of Zack and Cody. Those were really good. But the new shows like shake it up, Jessie, dog with a blog, and this show are just unfunny, cheesy, and boring. Walt Disney would be ashamed to have a channel like this with his name in it. This channel is just to far gone to change. I used to like how it was clean and funny for all ages, but I can't watch it anymore. Austin(Ross Lynch) is a bad actor. He's annoying, can't sing, he can dance I will give him that, but he's just cheesy and fake. His songs literally could not suck worse. Ally... just don't get me started. She has no talent at all. She's stupid, such a bad actress, a bad singer(Why did they hire her? Her voice is awful) her songs aren't good and just, ugh. Dez and Trish I don't mind that much. They don't add or take away much to the show. Dez is a little less childish I guess and he's not very funny but ya know, he's the classic stupid one of the show. I like how Trish is over weight, but still confident. I think that is good. Takes me back to that's so Raven. Anyway, just don't watch the show. Its a waste of time, literally.",2014
2,this show is annoying. The jokes fail and the characters are bad especially Dez who is the worst character of all media. Most of the jokes fail and are repeated over and over again like that character with the stupid gimmick of always getting fired and changing jobs. For those of you who don't know the story is about a partnership between a singer and a songwriter. The show that I would call a comedy if the joke were actually funny has been on the air for 3 years too long now. my least favorite episode is the one were that annoying blogger girl tries to destroy Austin's career because ally had a better song than her in preschool and I know what your thinking yes that's an episode,2014
8,"I started watching Austin & Ally and got caught up to the show in about a week and a half. It is an adorable show--the characters, the relationships, etc. are very cute and well-done.",2013
2,"OK the only reason I give this show a 2 is because of Tris and Dex.. When it came out I felt like it was over used and so much can happen in like, 2 episodes. The Austin character is whiny, self-centered and inpatient. In all the episodes, he is like ""Ally hurry up"" ""i need a song"" ""This doesn't work for me"" It really annoys me, and his voice is so squeaky...um puberty much?! In all his character is crappy, and he is suppose to be ""So hot?"" Nope! Btw he can't sing it is so squeaky Ally is just...delusional... She gets over stage fright in front of what, 10 people? She blames Tris for everything. Her songs make no sense, she can't sing and he acting is to preppy. She is always like ""Tris no"" ""i made a new song"" ""yay Austin "" How in the hell u right a full song, and book a gig, Overnight . Plus she has no self respect for herself, she gets pushed around all the time and doesn't even realize that she is the real star until like, season 2. Her and Austin had a relationship that lasted for like 3 episodes caused they all supposed to be star crossed lovers or something... Idk it is just stupid. The show teaches kids that u can become fa mouse by using your friends, disrespecting them, and abandoning them for selfish reasons.! And if u have noticed they take no part in school at all, it teaches kids to abandon school to become fa mouse cause that's what life is all about. Their parents don't even care or shown up. A good show, shows parent supervision, not letting them run all over Miami by them selves just cause they are 15, Please! Dez is disrespected the most, cause they all look down on him, and his music videos look low budget but gets 1,000,000 million views by 6 years old with frock phones. He is too clueless for his own good. But in all Dez is funny and his style is kinda cute Tris is bossy, and lazy and she does nothing but book Austin in gigs at malls. Tris is pretty awesome cause she is loyal. SO FINAL- Austin and ally suck",2014
9,"We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of ""bullet-time"" type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.",2011
3,"I will say all the good things first, then I can rant. This film was visually stunning. It was also pretty well acted especially by Jude Law, although he is obviously too young to be Watson. Robert Downey Jr. is also pretty good and his natural charm makes me want to like his character. I also quite enjoyed Stephen Fry's part as Mycroft, it was a nice surprise. I'm a little dubious about the casting of Moriarty, but he wasn't awful I guess. In fact I feel that the same actors with a different director and script would have made this film top-class.",2012
9,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. I have been waiting for it for what feels like forever now and it truly did not disappoint. The storyline was clever, the dynamic between Watson and Holmes was charming and beautiful, and the effects were incredible. Honestly, as much of a fan I am of the first movie, its sequel surpassed it and my overall expectation. Some the effects were unnecessary at times, but I really enjoy the style in which these movies are edited. It can be slightly confusing periodically, another reason to rewatch, still pay attention closely. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr.'s chemistry was compelling and the supporting actors were on par. I laughed, I nearly screamed, and I even cried. Game of Shadows is gripping, exciting, hilarious,and even draws tears. You'll be cheering throughout and satisfied with the end. Too be honest, it is absolutely one of the best movies of this year.",2011
10,"Talking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment compared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought back the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed perfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main characters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the way how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and the equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part, just go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments.",2011
2,"I lapped up Arthur Conan Doyle's works in my younger years and had recently begun re- reading them. However that is not to say that I am a Sherlock purist, far from it. I thoroughly enjoyed the BBC's recent take on Sherlock and am anxiously awaiting the beginning of the new series. Much the same can be said for Guy Ritchie's first exploit. I rated it as the best film of that year, enjoying the mix of the occult, to the back beat of Victorian London. Mark Strong portrayed a master villain who death and unease followed. There was then the balancing act that was Holmes and Watson. Jude Laws character being more than a blundering side kick and in some ways equal to Robert Downey Junior's Holmes. ",2011
8,So what's been happening lately?,2011
9,"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow"" picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.",2011
5,"Guy Ritchie has proved himself quite a stylish director. He has given us ""Rock'n'Rolla"" and the first of the Sherlock series before. Somehow, he has lost control of the material recently, and this is most obvious in the latest entry Holmes entry.",2011
6,"This is the second installment of the Sherlock Holmes franchise starring Robert Downey Jr. as the great detective. The first installment, which I saw exactly two years ago, was very impressing. That was a completely new take on Sir Conan Doyle's never dying detective story, full of style, fascinating action, humorous dialogs and amazing soundtrack. Robert Downey Jr. reinvented Sherlock; his Holmes is arrogant, sociopath but nevertheless absolutely lovable. The movie was peppered with something called ""flash-forward"" – which is how Sherlock planned his fights. Overall, the movie was easy to watch, the storyline kept attention and visually it was very organic. ",2012
1,"Something about anarchists and tensions between France and Germany, a gypsy fortune teller of indeterminate nationality with a missing brother who at one point I thought was buried in a basement but shows up at a peace conference/ballroom dance high up in the Alps. Oh, and throw in an evening at the opera, a dead dog brought to life with a shot of adrenaline to its heart, and a severe case of TB communicated apparently by teacups. ",2011
8,"Doesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved it from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed.",2012
4,"I would guess that Sherlock is one of the characters that would interest the more intelligent film enthusiast. I also have seen the much more intelligent written series from the BBC(of which I am awaiting the next season), and they clearly mist it by a big one with this poor excuse of a Sherlock Holmes. ",2012
1,"I went to this movie with high hopes. As it turns out, this movie was nothing more than pure drivel. It was simply drivel. Everybody says that this was the best of the two movies but I found myself frequently looking at my watch! Professor James Moriarty was very much a bore. When he was hidden in the room and talking from behind a curtain, Professor James Moriarty was a hopeful as an evil doer. Then he pulls the curtain back and he's simply a professor. I was hoping that he would at least have a scar or something. But there is nothing sinister about Professor James Moriarty. Now let's talk about Sherlock. For whatever reason, he is unable to be defeated in any kind of a fight. He has a ""disorder"" in which he can predict the outcome by observing things. Professor James Moriarty was just smart and good at chess. But Sherlock has this weird sense of humor in which he feels compelled to crack a joke every time he opens his pipe filled mouth. He even jokes around between punches in a fight. When he talks to Dr. Watson he jokes around and poor Watson is a cheap imitation of the strait man from the Three Stooges. Yes, you read that right - he's a strait man. As for Professor James Moriarty and his plot to take over the world by killing somebody in the mansion overlooking the water fall in the mountain, I have no idea. This plot was far to complicated. As let's not even talk about the gypsy people and their role. Oh, and what is the deal with how Sherlock blow coffee beans into that large brute's eye? Can you say RANDOM? Anyway, Professor James Moriarty is nowhere near as evil as I was hoping. I give this movie TWO PIPES DOWN!",2012
8,"As much as I loved the character interactions and insane chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, I was very much let down by Sherlock Holmes when I first saw it a few years ago. It was a really stylish and well-made film, but the storyline bored me to tears. I came in incredibly excited to see it, and left wishing it had ended sooner. With the obvious sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows upon us, I figured I would go in with much lower expectations and brace for something along the same lines.",2011
2,"Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be about clever mystery and crime solving not martial arts action, Mission Impossible style disguises and futuristic plastic surgery. Most of the plot is so impossible for the time period. The machine guns, the plastic surgery, the massive weaponry etc - it's just so wrong. There is little humor and they made Sherlock so beaten up and damaged looking.",2012
7,"Enjoyable second part as good and amusing as the first . Lavish production packed with action , intrigue , suspense and amusement . It's a nice film inspired on splendid novels about Sherlock Holmes character written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , including a first-range nasty with malignant aims incarnated by the Napoleon of Crime Doctor Moriarty . This time , Sherlock Holmes , Robert Downey Jr , his sidekick Dr. Watson , Jude Law , and a gypsy named Simza , Noomi Rapace , with the help of Holmes' older brother Mycroft Holmes , Stephen Fry , all of them join forces to outwit and bring down their fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty . Furthermore , one woman , Irene Adler , again played by Rachel McAdams , as a suspicious young with mysterious purports . Together, the team find themselves involved in a risked international conspiracy in which the fate of all of Europe hangs in the balance .",2013

5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes and approached this sequel with optimistic anticipation- only to be very disappointed. A budget that had doubled, multiple locations, and the confidence of a well received first instalment should have proved a solid platform for further success. Sadly, Director Guy Ritchie lost his way.",2011

1,"Not even worth a few lines of review. Wasted my budget on this garbage!! How can you spoil such a rich collection of characters, actors,story lines or even budget?! Just a pathetic attempt at...nothing! This is a crime against movie going humanity just because someone has the budget and backing to make a movie for idiots and morons. I wish we could tip the director over the waterfalls just as Holmes in the final scene except that he stays there forever!!I am so frustrated and feel someone has duped me with a sick sense of humour. Wish I had waited and taken the family to see MI next week.Want my money back!!",2011

7,"Lucy (Emily Browning) is a student working on a number of jobs. She's a waitress, she works in an office and she's involved with a science experiment at her university too. She's not co-operating with her housemates though and the rent is overdue. When she sees an ad in the paper she applies for it. She's driven to a manor house where she meets Clara (Rachael Blake). Clara describes the job, which involves Lucy being sedated in a bed and allowing men to watch her sleep. Lucy is assured that she will not be penetrated. Her first task with several other women is to serve a group of old men dinner at the manor house. After this she is put in a deep sleep and studied individually by three different men. Outside her job, one of Lucy's few relationships is with an old friend of hers called Birdmann (Ewen Leslie), a recovering alcoholic. ",2011
7,"When you create a film and title it ""Sleeping Beauty,"" you had better not make it boring. Otherwise, you'll get reviews utilizing every possible play on the word ""sleep,"" but more importantly, word of mouth will spread using the same types of puns. When you use a title made famous by the Disney animation, you're going to have to guard against those comparisons as well. As you can see, this film is already on the defensive.",2011
1,"The debut feature film by novelist Julia Leigh is anything but artistic, which is a goal that she obviously set out to achieve. Sleeping Beauty follows a university student going from one mundane job to another until she eventually settles into a position where she is put into a coma-like state so that old men can fondle her naked body while she lies in bed, lifeless. This interpretation of the classic fairy tale goes beyond provocative, but falls flat due to the lack of purpose of the main protagonist.",2011
1,The nihilist college girl Lucy (Emily Browning) has a dysfunctional family and lives together with her sister and brother-in-law. She is financially supported by three minor jobs: she is submitted to a weird experiment in a laboratory; she cleans a restaurant; and she takes photocopies in an office. She finds an advertisement in the newspaper offering a job in a fancy brothel and paying US$ 250.00 per hour. The madam Clara (Rachael Blake) hires her and she is assigned to serve drinks to wealthy clients on a dinner table wearing lingerie. Then Clara drugs her and she spends the night sleeping naked with impotent man that can do any kinkiness with her body but penetration. ,2012
1,"Total waste of time. What a disappointment this movie. I still have no clue why she burned her money, after all she had to pay the rent. I also don't understand the relationship with the Birdman, or the fact that she is asking another friend to marry her, the mom that calls her and asks for her credit card, why she lies to Clara about using drugs and alcohol, why she became sick in the car (is she pregnant?) or why she suddenly started to scream after she woke up for the last time. And what about that very last scene that takes ages? What's the purpose of that? I just don't get it. The whole movie is a collection of utterly boring long winded scenes that often are not related to each other. People come out of nowhere and disappear just like that, nothing is explained. Sure I understand that there needs to be something to make my own mind work, but this is complete confusion. I even had no idea what she did in that lab, I thought she was examined because of an illness. I suppose the purpose of the silences is to cause an artsy effect? I often just wanted to stop watching because I was annoyed, decided however to sit it out in the hope there would be something explained later. But alas, this was never the case. ",2012
6,"The depiction of human nature in this film is not completely miserable, but it's pretty miserable. Emily Browning plays the largely inscrutable Lisa, a university student in Sydney already exhibiting degrees of nihilistic behaviour before she signs on as a silver service lingerie waitress in a very weird, hoity-toity brothel of sorts. She quickly 'graduates' to the position of Sleeping Beauty in which, while voluntarily drugged and asleep, she becomes a sexual prop for grey-haired men rich enough to pay for the service. While asleep, she sees and knows nothing of what happens, but the audience of this film sees plenty. What is seen and heard is more disturbing than it is visually explicit, excepting the nudity of all involved, especially Browning's.",2011
5,"In a scene towards the climax of the film, we see Lucy (Emily  Browning), taking a lesson at university where the lecturer seems to be  analyzing a game of chess. The question is proposed, asking why would  someone make a move securing their defeat? This seems to be relevant  for Browning's character throughout this very interesting tale of  sexual depravity and the detachment of the female body to the masculine  libido. Lucy works her way through education, financing her way with  various menial jobs. She begins a job with an exclusive, and very  clandestine operation, beginning simply with silver service waitressing  in ""risque"" negligee. This of course progresses into a more dangerous  level, when she is offered a very well-paid gig involved a drugging so  that she may sleep whilst a client does what he wishes. Although, as  promised in Lucy's first interview, ""Your vagina will not be  penetrated"".  From first time director Julia Leigh, the film has various similarities  to Luis Bunuel's excellent Belle de Jour (1967), mainly in it's  depiction of a strong female character who wishes to delve into a  dangerous world of male desires. However, unlike Bunuel's film, Leigh  has created a character in Lucy, who seems utterly detached from the  people around her. She does visit Birdman (Ewne Leslie), who seems to  be agoraphobic, but this is not elaborated on. She seems also very  willing to do things without questioning. In one scene she is offered a  pill after her work in a restaurant, she asks what it is, but takes it  without having had an answer.  The film is self-consciously European in it's atmosphere and pace. The  handling of the subject matter is never gratuitous, neither does it  spoon feed a message of masochistic perversity. Browning is excellently  vacuous in the role, gently drifting from situation to situation with  not a question or any adversity. The film is beautiful to look at (and  I don't just mean the alabaster figure of the nude Browning), it's  pallet of autumnal colours adding extra references to 1970's European  cinema. There is no doubt that this film will divide viewers. Dirty old  men ogling over a sleeping, naked 22 year old, will make for  uncomfortable viewing for some, but I felt that this was not  exploitational in it's depiction. We also never really see what these  old men do in the time they are given with the ""sleeping beauty"". All  we get is an almost confessional from one of the customers. After being  advised by Clara (Rachel Blake) that there is no penetration, the  client states: ""The only way I can get a hard-on, is if I take 12  Viagra and get a beautiful lady to shove her fingers up my arse"".  The films conclusion is haunting, beautifully realised and ambiguous.  It certainly raises more questions than it answers about this detached  and seemingly passive female character in a world of strange male  desire. A film that will resonate in your mind some time after it has  finished.",2011
7,"Featuring Australian actress Emily Browning in the titular role, this bizarre and uncomfortable art film is almost worth watching for her exquisitely pretty face alone; but alas, she plays an utterly depressed character completely devoid of feelings, emotions, and, well, character—a combination uncomfortable to watch whatever face is behind it.",2013
9,"As the credits came up at the end of Sleeping Beauty the audience reaction was immediate, half chuckled nervously and I heard the word ""What?"" thrown around a bit. The other half stared ahead, absorbing what we'd just seen. It's clear that this will divide audiences.",2011
2,"I left the theater after seeing Sleeping Beauty shaking my head. Both my wife and I felt more than a little cheated. It really takes a special kind of bad to make a beautiful girl -- prostrated naked all over the screen for the better part of the movie -- boring and unappealing. And yet, this is precisely what we got from it. Why? The problem seems to be that much of the tension and drama hinges on empathizing with Emily Browning's character, a girl shallow and adrift, yet simultaneously cold to the world. Financial predicaments and dissatisfaction with life make her teen angst blossom into ugliness. The expression ""bored people are boring"" comes to mind.",2011
1,"I will carefully watch the career of Director Leigh and at all costs avoid anything that she ever makes again. There is a severe and astounding lack of story line or plot and any promise of a haunting, thrilling complex tale is a flat out lie. The film is a disjointed sequence of odd non relating scene's some of which are totally pointless and the rest are only fairly pointless. I would recommend anyone to watch anything else than this. There is no subtext, there is no complexity only pretentious gibberish. I hope this does not mean the end of Emily Browning, who was faultless in Sucker Punch but if that is the cost of never hearing of this film again it will be a bargain. 1 star and a grudging one at that!",2011

1,"This is by far the worst film i have ever seen!! The fade-outs are far too long there are scenes that are completely pointless the only thing that this movie has going for it is the unnecessary amount of nudity. But to be fair i would not expect anything less from an Australian film! The maids outfits were by far non-flattering, the storyline was more than confusing if not non-existent, i honestly have no idea what that film was about the end was beyond pointless and everything in-between was unnecessary. Don't get me wrong the acting was very good but the direction, screenplay and editing i feel was terrible. I personally would class this as more of a soft core porn with a story that could have been far better than it is, but everyone is allowed their own opinion!",2011
8,"An interesting choice. Prostitution amidst university students. Rich old men who spend their money on flesh. Modern 'dettachment'... separating the body from the heart, the soul, the mind. Most of the critics of this film seem to dwell on complaining that ""our world is not like that! All the people here are horrible...!!!"" Of course they are missing the point. We are watching crude realities, but also dreams, symbols, Freudian/Jungian fetishes... A woman is directing. Jane Campion is producing. This is also a 'clue' that MAYBE there is more to this film than meets the eye... Behind the veneer are MANY hidden truths.( Behind the Twin Towers, behind the choice of a black president after a guy like Bush jr.) Separation from the truth. We are all 'anaesthetised'... so Lisa is NOT so strange, after all. Money rules. Maybe we are victims of our society, of our times. We are 'dead', as T.S. Eliot wrote some years ago. Of course the world is full of wonderful, hearty, passionate and generous people. But this film aims elsewhere, and I myself feel grateful to its director, scriptwriter (and , why not, actress) for taking the plunge, and re-floating Pasolini's 'Salò' in a more digestible (maybe more intelligent?) guise. Kubrick? His last movie may still reveal something in the future (ALL his films age very well), but he was an elderly man, and this young director seems to have the upper-hand in as much as hitting the nail on the head with the 'ésprit-du-temps', the 'Zeitgeist' or, more plainly,(and painfully), the new age our youth are forced to grow up in. Somewhat puzzled at first, I gave this film a chance...let it 'breathe', in my conscience and intellect. I'm glad I did. It contains more than one morsel of food for thought.",2012

6,"There's a lot to be applauded in the debut feature of Julia Leigh; not least of which the performance of Emily Browning who shows incredible talent and fearlessness in portraying a young woman who cannot connect to the world around her and who, essentially, is sleeping her way through life.",2011
5,"It's not like I'm not capable of appreciating a good artistic or original movie, on the contrary really but this movie is offering far too little to make it stand out on any level.",2011
2,"This new Australian film is a haunting erotic fairy tale that caused something of a controversy when it screened at Cannes earlier this year. Many will be drawn to the film to check out what all the fuss was about. No doubt they will be disappointed. As will the raincoat brigade, drawn by reports of full frontal nudity and the heavy sexual content of the film. Rather than a voyeuristic fantasy, Sleeping Beauty is a rather dull and bland psychosexual drama from Julia Leigh, a former novelist making her feature film debut here. Sleeping Beauty is a provocative but ultimately pointless study of sexual dynamics, female sexuality, liberation, and willing female submissiveness. Ace Aussie filmmaker Jane Campion (The Piano, etc has mentored Leigh and championed the film, and its easy to see her attraction to this film which explores familiar theme of female sexuality. But one wishes she had had more input into the filmmaking process. Lucy (played by Emily Browning, from Sucker Punch, etc) is a cash-strapped university student who is juggling three part-time jobs to make ends meet. In desperation, she takes on a high paying job in a high-end brothel. At first she starts out as a waitress, but is soon promoted to ""sleeping beauty"", which is when things become a little creepy. She is drugged, stripped, and, while unconscious, becomes a baby doll who is groped and caressed by older lonely men who do all manner of perverted things – except penetration, which is strictly forbidden – that border on the necrophilic. ""You will go to sleep; you will wake up. It will be as if those hours never existed,"" Clara calmly explains, but Lucy grows curious and wants to know what goes on while she is asleep. At one stage it seemed like there was going to be an orgy scene, rather like Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Instead we get a strangely civil dinner party in which all the waitresses are scantily clad. There is something cold and detached about the sex scenes, which resemble Catherine Breillat's confronting oeuvre. This is a brave performance from Browning, who is nude or semi-naked for much of the time, yet manages to convey her emotionally fragile state. Rachael Blake (from Lantana, etc) is suitably cold and aloof as Clara, the madame of this high-class brothel that caters to a rather unusual clientele. The men who sleep with the narcoleptic Lucy are played by the urbane Peter Carroll, a sadistic and very creepy Chris Haywood, and a brutal Hugh Keayes-Byrne, who will forever be remembered as Toecutter from the original Mad Max. Unfortunately, Leigh's screenplay is sparse, and the overly pretentious dialogue is minimal and oblique, and gives little insight into character motivation. We are kept at a distance from the characters, and we feel little empathy or emotional connection with Lucy and her situation. We get very little backstory, apart from a few hints that point to her sense of desperation and worthlessness. Leigh's direction lacks flair, and when scenes are finished they slowly fade into black. However, the film has been beautifully shot by veteran cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (Shine, Little Women, etc), who works with long takes and steady framing. His crisp images are gorgeous, and the film has a surface beauty that contrasts with its dark subject matter. However, it is hard to see what audience Leigh is aiming for with her film. Sleeping Beauty is a far cry from the familiar fairy tale and the animated Disney film from 1959. Given its unsettling subject matter and Leigh's frank approach, this is a film that will prove divisive and provoke debate over its artistic merits.",2011
1,"Slow pacing is artsied up with pointless monologues into camera, lingering but sterile shots of nudity and cold unsympathetic characters, especially the lead. Is it a spoiler to warn you of an ""I'm too clever to give you an answer"" ending? Just in case it is I will tick that box... If you think it's worth it to see a pretty girl indulge some kinkiness as we delve into a privileged and exclusive club for old men with ED issues? Nope, it doesn't even titillate. It's more likely to sap your will to live than make your sap rise. The premise of why she does what she does, multiple menial jobs, experimental testing and ultimately prostitution, both vanilla and niche, is completely overdone. Her sister and obnoxious brother in law are cardboard representations of a mediocre family life, but hardly symbols of desperate deprivation or abuse. Her life just isn't that bad, she's not the only student whose ever had to work through college unsupported by family. She comes across as cold, empty and looking for shortcuts for the simple reason she is that kind of person. Despite a nipple to screen time ratio a genuine porn film would be proud of, it's just plain boredom leading up to a pretentiously inscrutable ending.",2012
8,"Not for the first time is it necessary to point out to several of the reviewers of ""The Borgias"" that the show is not a documentary.

Cesare alone can fulfill several episodes by himself! Rodrigo and Lucretcia and the other characters lead to a strong and powerful story line as well without leaving any of us wondering what happened to so-in-so? This show is one of the best period piece films, shows, series, etc that has come along in many years and I HOPE and PRAY that Showtime and all its co-hearts in business understand that the Fans want the show to go on! Please do not take this away from us! The actors are absolutely some of the best and under appreciated in the business and WE the FANS want MORE BORGIAS!! BRAVO BORGIAS!",2013

It was a time when the papacy was in disrepair with popes having wives and mistresses and all manner of scandal (sound oddly familiar...) and form this period in history highly regarded writer Neil Jordan has pasted together enough information about the infamous Borgias - 'the first crime family' according to the PR - to create what resulted in a fascinating account of world history, a fitting series whose first season of 9 episodes are tied together in this package of DVDs.

10,"This TV-series is brilliant so how can it only have 7,9 in rating? The first season was excellent and the second was even better at some points. I am watching the third season right now and it's good! The soundtrack alone is stunning and sometimes i find myself distracted by the atmospheric music that is played during the scenes. The actors are very good and the overall story is both unpredictable and immersive. The costumes as well are really well done, i have to say everything is good with The Borgias and those who downvoted the series obviously doesn't see the brilliance in it.",2013
7,"I loved every minute of this pilot. I was a little unsure at first when I read the show's summary because I'm usually not a fan of period drama. But I am huge fan of European history and have always thought the Borgias family contributed some of the most interesting stories in Rome's history. So, because of that, I decided to give it a try... and thankfully I was not disappointed. I can't wait to watch the next episode. Jermery Irons is AMAZING in his role as the newly crowned Pope. His superb acting sets the tone and elevates the bar for the whole cast. I can't imagine anyone else in that role, but him. The story draws you in right from the beginning, and moves along quite quickly. The sets were extremely detailed and visually stunning, as were the costumes. There was little I could find wrong with this this first episode. Showtime has done it again & brought us quite a gem.",2011
10,"I watched many historian series, like Rome, Tudors, or Ivanhoe. All these series were good, in my opinion Rome was the best and i thought that it would be impossible to make better series in that genre. Judging on pilot of the Borgias i was wrong. Casting is spectacular, all the actors are brilliant in their roles, specially Jeremy Irons as pope Alexander, and Colm Feore as cardinal. Storyline is swift, with good tempo, and also very interesting. Maybe there are some holes in historical view, but despite that series is Brilliant. I can't wait for more, and if it stays on this track, it will be one of the best series ever made! It is a shame they don't give Oscars for TV performances. Jeremy Irons would deserve one just for starring in pilot of the series !!!",2011
10,"Let me start by saying that I was hoping for the best but not expecting much. I was so surprised. One word could describe the pilot; ""Beautiful"". First of all, the credits sequence images and music were mystifying and haunting. The greatest accomplishment of this pilot was the setting, the atmosphere with the music, the lighting, the production design and the cinematography, all of which reminded me so much of what you would see in a feature film! Some scenes were just breath-taking. One that jumps to my mind specifically would be the Pope's coronation. Words can't possibly do it justice. ",2011
9,"Like many people who watch this series and others like it, I often pick out moments which are fictional or an historical event that is slightly altered. It doesn't really matter though especially if what the writers come up with instead is still interesting and entertaining. ",2013
8,"While the acting is absolutely fantastic and the casting is out right seamless accepting for David Oakes as Juan the show is only flawed in that it is historically inaccurate in several areas. Jeremy Irons is always fun to watch is roles like this, he can't help but wear his heart on his sleeve. François Arnaud is particularly brilliant in his portrayal of the conflicted Cesare and the performance of Holliday Grainger was awesomely stellar. I watched the French/German production of the same name. It's too bad one can't squeeze both of them together to make a really great story about this transgressive family. They don't make stories of this nature often.",2013

10,I have only seen the first two episodes of The Borgias but am already deeply immersed in this brilliant series.,2011
8,"I came across The Borgias going through Netflix suggestions and I was blown away. It centers on the Borgia family and its perils to maintain fortune and power in 15th century Rome. What I liked the most about this series is that there are no unidimensional characters. There isn't classic stereotypes, the bad can be endearing, the good can be greedy and so on. Rodrigo, the father and Pope of Rome, as an example is a corrupt womanizer who goes through extreme lengths to get what he wants, but has a love so deep for his family that's moving. He also believes in God and is somewhat a pacifist. What is both cringe worthy and beautiful is the relationship between Cesare and Lucrezia. They are brothers in love and they are doomed to spend their lives with unsatisfying people, since what they really want is to be with each other. The actors playing those characters are so good that you find yourself rooting for this couple and every time I caught myself not finding them together utterly gross, I reminded myself that they are not siblings in real life, because the chemistry between them is impressive. All the actors in this show are superb, however one of the highlights is probably Sean Harris and his portray of Micheletto, an illiterate assassin whose eye expressions convey more emotions than a lot of the dialogs. So, for an entertaining time in front of the TV giving some poetic license to history, you should definitely watch The Borgias.",2015

8,"Loved it when it aired first. The trailers didn't do justice to the plot but I thought that was a pleasant surprise anyway. Almost seems like they were the first crime family from Italy the way they're portrayed and how so many crime movies are based from there. The storyline itself was pretty good and moved at a quick and exciting pace as the Borgia family tries to usurp more and more power. the political and military moves are superb. The direction is very good and is the essence for the pace in the series. The casting is superb too and Jeremy Irons is made for the role. The other leading characters do a great job too. Am not sure of the historical accuracy of the story but it is loosely based on historical characters, all in all makes for an interesting watch of fiction at least. This was the take on series 1, anxiously awaiting 2 and 3.",2012
10,"This TV series is unbelievable. The acting, the sets, the camera shots, the music, the story, the humour, the suspense and the action it provides: I don't think I have ever been so amazed by a historical drama as by this one. Jeremy Irons as the Borgia pope, Sean Harris as the brutal assassin Micheletto, Holliday Grainger as the sweet but cunning daughter of Pope Alexander VI, David Oakes as the vicious lady killer, the second son of Rodrigo Borgia - all add to the authenticity of the plot with their perfect acting: the characters couldn't be more alive. However, it is Francois Arnaud playing Cesare Borgia, who stands out the most with his breathtaking performance. His every move, gaze, looks, voice is incredibly genuine: Francois Arnaud IS Cesare Borgia in this TV series. No matter what he does or says, you must love him for who he is. Of course the screenplay is brilliant at every single word but it is Francois Arnaud's excellence that brings life to the whole script. Unfortunately, as the historical basis itself was very dark some of the topics in the drama are not suitable for younger viewers, especially because they are plainly and quite vividly depicted on the screen. Sexual immorality, homosexual love, the vicious fight for power, revenge, incest, fratricide and gore at all level make the film suitable only for viewers over 16 (and are not squeamish), but they can learn a lot about the true ways of medieval papacy, religion, crime, loyalty, love and suffering, riches and poverty, family life in general. History and human behaviour couldn't have been brought to life any better than in the Borgias. Congratulations to all the cast (especially Francois Arnaud), the director, the screenwriter, the composer (the music is incredible) and let's hope Season 4 will come to finish this marvellous story.",2015

However, it has been falsely marketed to viewers, since before the beginning. First off, it is not very historically accurate, which wouldn't be so much of a problem, as so many films and television shows depicting actual historic events and people forsake the facts for dramatic purposes. The problem here is that, again, almost from the beginning, we are lured into watching, believing that we what will be getting is a more factual portrayal of one of history's most notorious families. That is false. We are being given nothing more than typical Hollywood fare, with characters dressed in pretty costumes, sets that are visually pleasing, and situations glossed over in favour of the sexual or titillating. Even in that, though, the show does not deliver.",2011
10,"I loved ""The Borgias"" and was really upset when it was canceled. I'm a total history nerd and the renaissance is one of my favorite time periods. This series is not just about the characters, but about life in the early renaissance. As far as historical accuracy goes, the writers did take some liberties, but it's still a thousand times more accurate than ""The Tudors"" ever was. For example, Machiavelli was actually a very young man, not the mature man he's portrayed as. And Ludovico Sforza was a refined patron of the arts, not the raging barbarian he's portrayed as. Season 1 is fantastic, but the first few episodes of season 2 felt like it was written by people who'd never seen the show for an audience who'd never watched it before. Scenes and conversations that were already played out in season 1 were basically repeated in season 2. There was also an episode where the characters take a tour of the city and talk to each other about what life is like during the renaissance. I felt like I was watching a documentary and I half expected a professor to step into the screen and address the audience directly. After these disappointing episodes, season 2 got better and the rest of it was just as great as season 1. Since the show was canceled during season 3, I was worried that it would end without resolving most of the story lines. Although the last episode ends very abruptly, all of the loose ends are tied up and whatever happens next is left to the audience's imagination. It was a satisfying ending, but historically, there's much more left to be told. Nevertheless, if you love history, you'll love ""The Borgias"". After you're done watching it, read about the real people and about the rest of the story this series leaves untold.",2015

10,"Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. ",2015
10,"I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. ",2011
8,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.",2013
8,"Well, color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed, it's always been big, loud, and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release, appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However, it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around, the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So, it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.",2011
8,Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.,2015
10,I had quite high expectations about this movie. And they paid of even more that I thought.,2012
8,"Like a fine wine, ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise just gets better and in ""Fast Five"" my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was high-flying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was, and then I was starting to give up hope once ""Tokyo Drift"" was released, yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when ""Fast and the Furious"" was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise, but ""Fast Five"" exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean ""Lethal Weapon"" has had very good sequels in its heyday and ""The Terminator"" not to mention ""Rocky"" as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time; it's like an underdog in its own right.",2012
10,"After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that ""Fast 5"" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However I am pleased to say the series has redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out all the stops this time around. It delivers on action, cars, quality acting and a decent storyline. It explores the character personalities showing more humor, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie strength and depth that was missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. ",2011
8,"The weather is finally better, people are taking their clothes off all over the place and even though it is still spring time, summer movies are now officially kicking off and ladies and gentleman, we start this summer right with Fast Five. The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste, a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie, like intellectual dialogue, solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No, what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn, no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand, I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin (who also directed the fast and the furious) makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION, and you know..In an action moviethat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So , umback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action, I seriously have not seen this kind of solid , non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Ohso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious, the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films, filled with cheesy cliché's that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great, it's these roles he should be taking, not the flying fairy kind, he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his, this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything, and he really does know everything. Frankly, that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film, that's all you need. So this one is easy folks, for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them, you should know better, you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action , seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars , beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.",2011
9,"As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.",2011
10,"I've been a personal fan of the F&F series ever since the very first title was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I immediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was successful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise, fast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action scenes.",2011
9,"Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite  all the fans of the previous film(s) and then disappoint them with a  production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a  remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse   this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this  fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors, read on to see why.  Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off, with Dominic  sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the  end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was  that they managed to break Dom out of custody, dodged every authority,  and have fled to Rio de Janeiro (where every Brazilian seems to be  portrayed as a gun-toting thug). In order to break free, they attempt  to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all  become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips  through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs  (Dwayne Johnson), who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord  Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who wants them dead.  That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances  guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations  and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he  was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE  side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But  Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of  filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular  action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of  The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a  'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than  racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing, and for the  record there's even an ex-wrestler versus action hero fight like there  was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone.  The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the  audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in  process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the  audience knows who, what, when, how and why the team are in Brazil. The  second act revolves around the main plot element of the $100 million  heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew  plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand  would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours, longer than all of the  previous films. The 10 minutes after a full two hours weren't really  necessary but show us the aftermath of the third act, the hugely  thrilling act. Any who feel frustrated at the pace of the second act   stay for the climactic scene in the third act.  Think of Fast Five as the cinematic equivalent of a mindless muscular  athlete. Can't talk a good game but can surely play a good game. We  have all met that person, that guy who failed his exams but took the  football pitch by storm at high school. Fast Five is as absent minded   plain characters and clunky dialogue. But the 'physical' side is where  it amazes  the action scenes of course. It's like the men behind the  camera decided to perfect the action scenes, the plot was secondary.  Looking at this year's earlier films The Mechanic and The Green Hornet,  it's safe to say that Fast Five has the best action sequences of the  year yet, and is the best action film overall so far.  Verdict: Forgive the simplicity of the script and get ready for the  fastest and most furious ride yet.",2011
9,"Without a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches it's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of friendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.",2013
7,"Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot.

9,"Having heard (when the trailer was first released) that this was going to be the last in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise I went in expecting to see all the lose ends tide up but instead I found more were made than were tide. It's a great movie and I love all the characters (each one has a great story and depth behind them) but the fact that in the fourth one Letty is meant to have died whilst trying to get the man she loves - Dom - back into the US and is shown in a photo and believed to be alive in Berlin without telling her beloved where she is, is slightly confusing. Also at the start of the fourth it is meant to show what happened to Han before he wound up in Tokyo Drift (where he met his doom (weep)) and he as well as the audience seemed pretty convinced that he was heading straight there, but he somehow finds his way into Fast and Furious 5 because he hasn't quite made it to Tokyo yet - to confusing for my liking although I couldn't stop smiling when the whole gang is brought together - great idea and fabulous surprises - I can't wait the sixth one (confused that there is a sixth one though)!!!",2012
8,"Honestly, this is the third ""Fast and the Furious"" movie I have seen but by far was this the best one! With an amalgamation of genres, this movie would possibly appeal to all types of viewers except those who love ROM-COMs! I loved how everyone came together to do the job; the same people I loved in the movies which I saw together made my day as there was so much to relate to! Not much racing as the others, but what is there truly keeps you glued to your seat. Screenplay was interesting, locations eye-catching and casting, already stated! It's one of those movies which you like a lot while watching it and then later think about what happened within it at random times. Yes, you may not want to give it a second view immediately or even soon after, but you just may replay those highlighted scenes, for example, when Vin Diesel and ""The Rock"" face off. That fight was intense and boy, was it gripping!",2012
9,"The fifth installment of the hit ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Fast Five"", is bigger, better, thrilling, amazing, and it's so entertaining. This story is set in Rio de Janeiro, right after the events of the fourth movie, where Dominic Toretto, Mia Toretto, and Brian O' Connor teams up with everyone from the previous movies, to plan a $100,000,000 heist from the most powerful hit-man in all of Rio, without being caught by Agent Lucas Hobbs. The action is exhilarating, and it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. The plot is remarkable, and it has a heart of gold contained with drama and action. The cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, ""Ludacris"", and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who stole the show for his new performance as Agent Lucas Hobbs, was all quite spectacular, and they brought thrilling and heartwarming characters. Justin Lin was the perfect director to arrange such a movie like this, with all the action, the timing, and the energy. The cinematography and editing is super challenging and enjoying, and the script by Chris Morgan is a heart of gold. The directing is top-notch, the action is exhilarating, the cast is perfect, the plot is excellent, and the finale blends with a perfect notch of surprise. ""Fast Five"" is known as an epic, thrilling, funny, heartwarming, and excellent movie that I was entertained with all that high non-stop thrills and chills. ""Fast Five"", in my review, ""an exhilarating thrill ride, with a story to die for"".",2011
10,"This movie has every possible element a great action movie should have! Cars, hot girls, a decent plot, loads of action and an explosive ending that marks the beginning of another sequel. The person that thought of confronting Vin Diesel and The Rock is a mastermind, and just for the brilliance of the idea should be awarded with an Oscar. The testosterone level was, at points, so high that I was literally shouting and cheering at the TV set. Emotions are also well incorporated so the movie has depth. The characters are, even though there is a whole bunch of them (the entire FF crew from every movie in the franchise), well described, complex, and interesting. I was a little afraid that there would be too much of them at once, but boy was I wrong! Every character has it's own story told from the beginning 'till the end. The music was nicely picked but, in my opinion, there could have been a little more metal or rock (Sepultura would have been a good choice since the movie is made in Brasil). The thing that shook me entirely was the ending. The photo that Eva presents to The Rock is so shocking that I couldn't have believed my eyes! And I must say, not many movies in the last few years managed to create that sort of feeling in me. There is only one problem with the movie: it ends. Get your crew, grab as much popcorn and sodas as you can and have a blast.",2011

I am all for action films, love them, but only if they can suspend my disbelief, in other words, take me into the film, get me involved, make me care about the characters and know everything I see is amazing but still possible.",2011
1,"I saw this movie with expectations. The IMDb score were at the time 7.9, so I thought that this movie would be pretty good, but trust me, its not! What bothers me the most about this movie is the extreme stupidity and lack of logic. For example, in the beginning of the movie the team is raiding a train to steal cars located in the last carriage. A few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear when the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage containing the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of, but when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars, they suddenly get aware of the raid.

6,"Now, this movie had its strengths... and its weaknesses... First off, great acting. All actors were superb. Good action scenes, nice action shots and cinematography. The script was a bit shabby.. But I need to vent about my main issue with this title... It doesn't have any realism in the movie at all. None.",2011
7,"""Home sweet home"" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast & Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.",2011

9,"After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.",2011

After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.",2011

The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.",2011

9,"People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !",2011

8,"Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.",2011

8,"Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. ",2011
9,"In reading the reviews for this film, it seems to me that most people who strongly disliked this film either didn't really pay attention to it or just didn't get it. One main example being the criticism that Emma loving Dex in the first place never made any sense. Yes, he was a rascal in college, but let's be honest, he's exactly the kind of guy who got all the girls in college. After their ""near miss"" on the day they officially met, they did in fact become friends. He's the only one who helps Emma move, albeit grudgingly. And when she's feeling low about still working in that Mexican restaurant, he's the one who gives her a pep talk and supports her, and we can see he's sincere about what he tells her. When he loses his way and stops being a friend to her is when she breaks off contact with him. In fact, losing her is part of what makes him shape up, even though most of the credit is given to Sylvie. We later see, however, Sylvie is not the saving grace he thought she was.",2011
4,"In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. ",2011
8,I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.,2015
3,"There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.",2011
1,"I had a lot of problems with this film; in a nutshell - both main characters were a pair of complete numpties. Anne Hathaway's character was this 21-year old going on 50 year old who did a good impression of a frigid librarian whilst also managing to be very annoying and an absolute scunner. Jim Sturgess (mental note - will avoid all films with him in future) was a right banker, only replace the 'b' with a 'w'. He had this terrible transatlantic, slimy twit of an accent going on, I didn't find him charming or enigmatic, I just thought, you're a right idiot.",2011

1,"After the poor trailers and even poorer reviews, I wasn't expecting anything from this film but the interesting premise still motivated me to watch it. As anticipated, it was a trainwreck essentially from the start. For starters, it's structured all wrong; it feels so rushed through in a large part, with a lot of the focus only being on three or four days over the course of two decades. Of course with that being said, it never even feels like two decades have past. They change the actors looks slightly and I like that they didn't try to go overboard with the makeup and everything, but they look too old at the beginning and way too young at the end.",2011

4,This movie had plenty of potential. Surely it was a consistently grim and depressing film but the themes about love and the main cast kept us interested. This movie had potential in which the aura of hope was strong enough to keep us wanting to see a nice resolution---in the midst of the depression.

It is not the best biography of the man. It is not a behind-the-scenes of the FBI. What it is ... another piece of quality filmmaking from Clint Eastwood. It's an overview of J. Edgar Hoover and his nearly 50 years of civil service under 8 U.S. Presidents.,2011
8,"Just got back from a screening in Vancouver~ Thanks to Clint Eastwood, it was almost free (only one dollar per ticket) I will try to keep my review spoiler-free~",2011
7,"American actor, producer, composer and director Clint Eastwood's thirty-third feature film is an American production which was written by screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. It tells the story about J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972), who grew up with his two elder siblings in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington. In 1917, after receiving his Master of Laws degree at the George Washington University, he was hired as a clerk by the Justice Departement where he meet Helen W. Gandy (1897-1988) who would become his personal secretary. J. Edgar Hoover was a very private, secretive and ambitious man who was totally dedicated to his job. He lived with his mother Anne Marie and didn't have much of a social life, but in 1924, J. Edgar Hoover became the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and during this period he meet a confidential secretary for the Secretary of War named Clyde Tolson (1900-1975), whom he hired as his vice director. ",2012
6,"The best that can be said for this film is that it got made. The subject matter, about the life of a dreadfully dull and stodgy old bureaucrat from a bygone era, is not in line with Hollywood's usual mass-produced action films aimed at brash young boys. I credit Director Eastwood and lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio with enough star power to convince the money-men to fund this project. And it turned a profit.",2013
2,"What a shocking disappointment. A director of Eastwood's caliber, an actor of DiCaprio reputation, giving us this travesty - no pun intended - of a biopic. Claude Rains and Madamr Constantine in ""Notorious"" someone made that comparison - I wish it had been that entertaining. This one is dull, dull, dull. Not a real insight into the man or, maybe more importantly, about the times of the man. Little, meaningless sketches about enormous events. I wonder what was the intention behind this venture. The ""old"" make-up was worthy of a B picture of the 50's. Jaw dropping really. I've always sensed that Eastwood, the director, left the actors to their own devices and, unless the devices belong to Gene Hackman or Sean Penn, the performance a rather poor. Here DiCaprio ""recites"" his lines with grit but without conviction. I couldn't wait for the film to be over and I waited and waited and waited.",2011
5,"Snipets of history and then a tabloid romance that, in its day, was made of rumor and innuendo. A psychotic, paranoid schizophrenic, as I see it, head of the most powerful Federal Bureau Of Investigation, corrupted by his own power and his obsession with secrecy is a character worthy of Peter Lorre but in this new outing of the prolific Clint Eastwood, J Edgar Hoover is Leonardo DiCaprio! I love both DiCaprio and Eastwood but not in this. I love DiCaprio for Gilbert Grape and Eastwood for The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven. Here they are both out of their depths. Long, boring film with terrible aging make-up and no real center. The most unexpected aspect was the time dedicated to the romance between J Edgar and Clyde Tolson. It humanized the man without revealing him. That's almost cheating.",2011
2,"Lets not beat around the bush. This film takes the viewer down a sad and depressing road of poor make-up, dry and boring scenes not to mention a story of the life of a man that was tied to his mother's apron strings.",2011
5,"It can happen to the best of us. Spielberg, Scorsese, Hitchcock, and even Clint Eastwood himself are capable of making an instantly-dismissible picture. Sometimes, it seems, a director will find himself in a project without much of a passion for it and looking at the final product, it's kind of hard to see his signature on the screen. That is the case with Mr. Eastwood's biopic on the life of J. Edgar Hoover. The movie, ""J. Edgar"", is everything I did not expect from Mr. Eastwood considering the deep, thought-provocative and artistic power of his last movie ""Hereafter"" as well as the many films that he made beforehand. Slow, pretentious, and middling.",2011
8,"Clint Eastwood's boldness and creativity paid off in this excellent portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover's life. A project like that is not pulled off by just anyone, and the fact that a film like that was even made shows the importance of Clint Eastwood. His direction was marvelous, by the way, showing without fear the dark side of the FBI director, but also showing all the good aspects of this very interesting subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is another great reason to watch the film, in one of the most moving performances in his career. His portrayal of a Hoover both ruthless and emotionally vulnerable was superb, and he has excelled once again in studying the character. The make up must also be praised for allowing DiCaprio to portrayal Hoover in many different stages of his life. J. Edgar, if not Clint's best work, is a very interesting and moving film, and the fact that it is so under-appreciated is a mystery to me.",2012
10,"Why are there are these horrible reviews? I just saw this movie yesterday and it was utterly fantastic. I'm not the only one that thinks so. The theater was packed with people, mainly from adult to elderly but it was packed non the less. Everyone was clapping at the end of the movie. ",2011
8,"There is no doubt that a Leonardo DiCaprio film is a must watch, different and interesting. Here comes a real life character for him to play, that of J Egar Hoover- in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Great performances by Leo and especially Armie Hammer and possibly an Oscar winner for Leo. Director Clint Eastwood doesn't fail to give his special dark background touch more like a sinister soul haunting the room. But is it possible that there is a J Edgar in each one of us? The awakening comes not when he proposes, outsmarts his peers, makes a super filing system or brings in a scientific touch to the forensics department; but when his mother played by Judi Dench says ""I would rather have a dead son than a daffodil!"" How many times in your life have you arrived at a dead end and be put down. Sure he had his quirkiness but in the end he made a difference in a system, country and the people connected from President to Investigator. How many people in life leave such fêtes? How many even bother to attempt? No we stop, we question and we fail because we lack courage to make hard choices, personal sacrifice and be true to ourself. A good piece from Hollywood, and a nice chapter to think about in your life.",2012

7,"This is an interesting film for me, mostly because I take interest in both history and forensic investigation (i.e. CSI). I'm also a fan of DiCaprio's more recent films, and I had high hopes in this one. However, the actor who stole the show was, surprisingly, Armie Hammer. DiCaprio's fake accent and old makeup weren't believable at all to me, which was distracting... and I ended up feeling that he's DiCaprio instead of J. Edgar. Hammer on the other hand, was magnificent. It was mostly his scenes that saved this film for me - his scenes were the only ones that made me FEEL something.",2012
9,"I'm one of those viewers who can not comprehend bad reviews from below. This is an almost perfect movie: excellent performances by the cast, traditional discrete direction by Mr. Eastwood (also his ever fantastic music score), emotions, well written script... You name it. Let's clear out one thing: This is NOT primarily a biographic movie but a story of love and devotion. And that's why Mr. Eastwood excels again. If you want a biopic, you can give it to anyone, but if you want an emotional story perfectly told, you give it to Mr. Eastwood. He is an artist par excellence.",2012
3,I'm not really sure where to begin.,2012
1,"Never has a movie's trailer been so deceiving, teasing an epic  biographical drama about the rise and fall of a powerful man with  secrets that ruined him. But there's no rise to be any fall or much of  anything else for that matter.  Leonardo DiCaprio, playing J. Edgar Hoover, bounces from boring one  scene (and/or time period) to the next displaying no qualities of a  person who, although flawed and now considered a joke, did make an  impact. His innovations in fingerprinting, and the climb from a snoopy  young agent to the head of the F.B.I., are treated as importantly as a  midnight snack.  And the only revelations are that he loved his mother and was a  closeted homosexual, but even these stories play out like bad soaps.  While segments following taut historical situations, like the Lindbergh  kidnapping, build no suspense whatsoever  leading only to Hoover  screwing up the situation: time and time again.  Most of the side-characters, from biographers to politicians to fellow  agents to his closest friends, are used merely as  counterpoint-mouthpieces: questioning everything Hoover says just in  case the audience can't figure out each lie on their own.  DiCaprio is far better here than THE AVIATOR, where he was completely  miscast playing a grownup. With his narrowed eyes fervently seeking  purpose, he tries very hard, even in the fake looking old man makeup  but with a script so lacking of any personal or historical  significance, it feels like he's treading water.  But the worst crime, exceeding the fact most of the dialog occurs  between two people who'd never (later on) revealed the conversations,  is it's downright boring.  Director Clint Eastwood should either retire or go back to making  action movies, because this clunker had no pulse whatsoever.",2011
1,"""J. Edgar "" started out slow and cheesy and got progressively worse. I don't think there was any portion of this movie I could say something good about. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, occasionally rising to OK, and the directing was awful. I can't say that the editing was awful as it appears that they didn't edit it. Incredibly long scenes of nothingness seemed to linger - making the 2 hour plus movie feel more like 5 hours.",2011
10,I will be short on this film because it probably is one of the best by Clint Eastwood.,2012
10,"I enjoyed this film, thought it was well documented and gave me historical references I didn't know about. Well done Clint Eastwood! The acting was fabulous too. Gave me new respect for DiCaprio...... I found it amazing his secretary would have stayed with him for so long; maybe he did have some charisma?",2012
10,"Impractical Jokers premiered last night with two back-to-back episodes, and it had me laughing non-stop for an hour. ",2011
10,"Love the show, I haven't been able to find it on TV in Canada, i have been watching it online...",2012
10,This show is a hilarious combination of real life pranks/dares filmed and prompted by 4 friends with a wonderful sense of humor and camaraderie.,2012
10,I think this show is hilarious!! I have never laughed as hard in my whole life as when I watch this show. Murr is definitely my favorite; he has the most infectious smile I've ever seen..he's just adorable. All 4 of these guys are very talented and what I enjoy most is the fact that their reactions are so genuine and don't seem scripted and fake as so many other shows do. The looks on people's faces are positively priceless!! Sal's reactions are perfect and he seems like someone who is very well-mannered and doesn't want to say or do anything to offend anyone; particularly if it's a pretty girl he's trying to pull one over on. This is a show I will continue to watch as long as it's on the air and my family and friends are big fans of it as well. Keep up the good work guys!!,2012
10,"Keep it up guys, you'll be famous in no time! This show is so raw and entertaining. My wife even likes it.Sal is definitely my favorite because he is always losing and is genuinely trying to be a nice guy in his delivery. Q is also very good, too good if you ask me, almost ""creepily"" good. The other two are also funny because Joe looks like Steve Carrel in some of his facial expressions and mannerisms. Murr looks like a thin pervert version of George Costanza and is funny as hell when hes trying not to laugh. The chemistry between the group is awesome and the delivery of the material is always creative. Its like jackass but a cleaner more watchable version. The only thing that i wish they would add is the participant's reaction when they find out its a prank. Not everyone but just one or two peoples reaction at the end of the show. Other than that, it keeps me tearing up. Thanks TRUtv for my new favorite show.",2012
10,"I generally hate most of the things on truTV, I'm pretty sure that the majority of the population does but this show is different. It isn't like anything I've ever seen because although it has some ""Jackass"" aspects to it and some reality TV aspects to it, it is an entirely different show that never gets old. It's what you wish you could be doing with you're buddies rather than going to work, just messing with ordinary people and seeing how far you can take a joke with someone who doesn't know what is going on. It's hilarious and it only takes 15 minutes to get hooked for life. I turned on reruns of this show one day in a fraternity house and within 30 minutes the entire 30 person house was watching and laughing, that is how good this is, everybody who gives it a chance will love it, I guarantee it.",2012
10,If I could give this show more than ten stars I would. I have watched this show from the very first episode and have laughed from beginning to end in every one of them. It is the funniest show I have seen in years. The cast is very likable and pull some great pranks on the people around them. They actually had a meet and greet with their fans in New York City last year. The fans were waiting in lines the stretched out the doors to meet the guys. They shook everyone of their fans hands and took pictures with everyone that came out to meet them. A great show and great group of guys. I have recommended this show to all my friends. Hope this stays on the television for years to come.,2012
9,"I'm not usually one to fall for a simple laugh. But these four friends remind me so much of the guys I hang out with, I can't get enough. Off the wall, who can make who do the most zany public display of insanity. It cracks me up. These four guys, who really have been friends since grade school it turns out, challenge each other each week to see who is willing to do the most crazy embarrassing thing in public. Usually one of them has an earpiece while the other three friends are feeding them instructions. If the friend with the earpiece doesn't do what they tell him to, he loses that round. At the end of the show, whoever has the most losses, has to do something EXTREMELY embarrassing. I watched the 'best of' where they actually interviewed these guys and that's when I became a real fan, because it started out just the four of them doing this without a camera. Glad they started filming, because it's really funny.",2012
10,I don't know how anyone cannot laugh along with these guys. I always feel like I'm in on the joke. They all have such awesome personalities and it's so funny to see them interact with the public. The reactions are always amusing.,2013
10,"I just started watching this show, and I'll share a little tidbit of how I began to watch Impractical Jokers. When I was watching TruTV, advertisements kept on coming up for this show, and I thought that it looked completely stupid and idiotic. So, one night, I turned it on to see how stupid it was and low and behold, I actually began to like it. I hadn't even watched it for two minutes before I began to chuckle and it stayed that way for the duration of the show. Impractical Jokers is absolutely hilarious! What makes it even more funny is that it seems to be legitimate. With TruTV's programming, most, if not all, of it is fake. Shows like Operation Repo, Hardcore Pawn, Storage Hunters, Lizard Lick Towing, South Beach Tow, etc. all seem to be scripted. Impractical Jokers doesn't have that feel to it, as everything seems genuine -- the pranks, the laughs between the four guys, and everything else. That's what is perhaps the best thing about the show because it's on a channel that airs predominantly scripted shows. Many people seem to think that Impractical Jokers is a reality TV show, but that's definitely not the case. As I said earlier, I thought the show was idiotic at first, but then I began to watch more and more and I have now seen nearly every single episode of theirs.",2013
10,I came into IMDb actually not sure what this would get. I was thinking a 5.9 or 6.3 but it was an amazing 8.7/10! ,2016
10,"This show is hilarious. You should totally disregard any review that is negative about this show, as they are just haters. This show is nothing like boiling points Punk'd or any other show, it's just four dudes that do totally embarrassing/hilarious things with normal people onlooking or involved. This isn't a reality television show, so I don't know why people say it is, everything on this show is real. Which includes the laughs which are not forced. My favorite skits include: well pretty much everything, but I would say my favorite is when they are working at the sub shop. Watch this show you'll pee your pants, but you will be laughing so hard you won't notice.",2012
10,Funniest show I have ever seen reality on TV period. I came across this show last week at like 2am; couldn't fall asleep so I was surfing channels and I was hooked right away. Imagine my horror when I found out that the show is in season 3! I have to look for season 1&2 stat. The guys are crazy funny and great at improve. Murr is my favorite but they are all fabulous and hilarious and keep my laughing for the entire show. I love the punishment that the losers get at the end. The funniest so far was when Q had to read a children's book about a dung beetle to a bunch of children and their parents. Lord I laughed so hard I cried. There was also another where Sal I believe had to use the bathroom in a coffee chop and open the door while sitting on the toilet to ask patrons for tissue because there was no toilet paper. LOL!!!!!! I love the interaction between the guys and I love that they are regular Joe's . There are like 10 episodes scheduled to play in 2 days and I have my DVR set. Can't wait,2014
7,"Impractical Jokers is simply four guys going around the city of New York and key spots in New Jersey doing outrageous challenges trying to embarrass each other. Incredibly hysterical. Recommended for everyone. It's guaranteed 30 minutes of non-stop laughter, and a hilarious punishment for the loser who couldn't complete all the challenges. MUST WATCH 10/10. Joe Gatto, James Murray, Sal Vulcano and Brian Quinn are four guys who just like to mess with each other. They humiliate each other so often. They hassle Brian in looking like Rosie O Donnell, Murray on looking like a ferret, Sal for being a nervous wreck, and Joe is just really good at handling the attempted embarrassment. On truTV every Thursday from 8-11 pm. Overall, this show couldn't be funnier. The guys go from simple tasks in the park to working at movie theaters, pizza parlors, and white castle, which may be some of their funniest material. SO FUNNY",2013
10,"This is the best show ever! These guys are the funniest people ever! I watch this show all day. My favorite people on here are Sal Vulcano and Joe Gatto! Love these guys. I wish I could get to meet and hang out with them. Tonight is a new episode. In Illinois on DirecTv it's on Every Thursday at 9:00. Thursday is my favorite day of the week because of that. I would recommend anybody and everybody I know and don't know to watch this show. These guys are geniuses at Comedy. I already bought The Complete First Season on DVD. I can't wait for season 2 on DVD! Tonight's new episode is called ""Toasted"". The Jokers have awesome Twitter Pages ,Facebook Pages, Instagrams, and More!!! On Twitter the guys are @trutvjokers @SalVulcano @Joe_Gatto @JamesSMurray @BQQuinn. On Facebook just search their names to find them. On Instagram Search by their names too. Even Joe Gatto's dog named Cannoli Gatto has an Instagram and a Twitter. I am THE #1 FAN of this show!!! On Twitter I'm @Brooke_Biggs02! 😃💙💜💚❤️💖",2014
10,"""Impractical Jokers"" is the funniest show I have seen in a very long time. It follows four grown men (Joe Gatto, James Murray, Sal Vulcano, and Brian Quinn) who walk around New York City one or two at a time doing whatever they are told to do by the others. If they refuse, they put themselves at risk of being the ultimate loser at the end. Each with their own talents, these four never cease to make me laugh out loud. One thing that makes the show especially funny is that the people they are forced to talk to are real people, and their reactions are not scripted. I recommend ""Impractical Jokers"" to anyone looking for a good laugh.",2013
10,"I LOVE IT!!! This show, as mentioned above, is one of the only reality TV shows that is actually worth watching. I watch it with my brother all the time. Joe Gatto, known as Joe, Sal Vulcano, known as Sal, James Murray, known as Murr, and Brian Quinn, known as Q, make one of the funniest and creative comedy troupe I have ever seen. The real gist of the show is that you have to do and say what you are told, mostly, and sometimes other stuff, like trying to get people to do stupid things. It's one of these shows that you really don't care if someone loses, but if someone wins, hooray! Who cares if you might have done the stunts if you were two years old? It's even more funny if you are 35 years old and married. Well, some of them are. Anyway, the boys never fail to be hilarious, and them getting along through their lifetime of friendship makes the show even more enjoyable. Trust me, some of these stunts are making you be happy you weren't on the show. At the beginning of the show, it comes out with a warning that says ""Warning, this show contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four lifelong friends who compete to embarrass each other. Viewer Discretion is advised."" Making you think it's going to be graphic, but it isn't really. Even my dad laughs at it when I make him watch it, telling you it's hilarious. I laugh through all half hour, which is how long the show is. One of the only things I don't like about the show is that sometimes they curse, not a lot, but when they do, it's in a chain. It doesn't take away from the show, though. The scenes where they have to go up to random people and invade their privacy, are just downright hilarious. I hope this show isn't scripted, because that would really take away from the hilarity of the show. I can rave forever on this show, but, I think I summed it up well enough. This is also really short compared to my other reviews. See ya!",2013
10,"This television show is one of the few shows left that is 110% REAL! True reality television is so hard to come by now-a-days but this show is really living passed the industry standard. Wish this show was longer than its air-time. Also, the guys on tour featuring the Tenderloins is EXCELLENT! Must attend for any Impractical Jokers fan. Easily said to be one of the most successful shows on the TruTV Network. Hands down my favorite show on television!! After 5 seasons aired as of Summer 2016 & just getting the green light for Season 6; I hope to see many many more years of success for this TV Show, its cast, crew and fans! Kudos to the cast Murr, Joe, Sal & Q for fun family friendly comedy.",2016
9,"Hahaha just thinking about this show makes me laugh.. The show is about four friends daring each other to act and say inappropriate and or funny things to strangers to earn points and the person with the lowest points gets punished at the end of the episode. Joe and Mirr are my favorites, but Q and Sal are super funny too. I've never laughed so hard watching any other TV show nor movie. These guys make me fall to the ground from laughing! They are so smart and clever with the skits. Aside from being so funny, the show is also very believable. I don't get any feeling to indicate that the strangers are acting like I do with some other shows. IJ is a weekly treat. This show is a weekly treat. It's the best comedy on TV, in my opinion. So glad I discovered this this show...going to tell everyone about it.",2015
10,Impractical Jokers,2015
10,"Impractical Jokers is a show that will get me in a good mood compared to other shows like the news or a show more informal. They usually have a goal to accomplish in each episode instead of just teaching or informing people about something. Also, they have a good sense of humor. Impractical Jokers is show that will make you laugh. Impractical Jokers is a show about 4 guys who have been lifelong friends who try to embarrass each other by making them go around and do whatever the other guys tell them to do. For example, if they don't do what they are told; they lose. Additionally, each time they lose; they will get a thumbs down. Yet if they complete the task, they get a thumbs up. In conclusion, whoever has the most thumbs down at the end of the episode, they lose and are the ""big loser."" For instance, the ""big loser"" usually will have to do a terrible punishment at the of the episode. For example, one time one of the guys had to get a tattoo on their body and they couldn't chose what it would be. The four guys who are in the show have been lifelong friends. Their names are Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano, Brian ""Q"" Quinn, James ""Murr"" Murray. Also, you can find their show on TBS. Right now, they have done four seasons and are working on their 5th. The show is well put together and has lots of positives. They make the scenarios live in the moment and I love to see the reactions from different people. They also have a great sense of humor and seem to get along with anyone. Yet, on the contrary there are some negatives to the show. I think that they do script who wins and loses each task because some tasks seem fairly simple but then one of them can't complete it. Also they have started to shorten the amount of competitions in the past seasons which make the show not as fun to watch because there are less scenarios. I believe the show will gain more popularity the more seasons they do. The four guys have a great future ahead of them. I can't wait to see what crazy ideas they have coming up in their new episodes.",2016
10,"I had to text a family member after I saw a couple episodes of this because it's the funniest show maybe I've ever seen. I rank Seinfeld, Always Sunny, Trailer Park Boys, Curb as some of my favorite and this is every bit as good. They've been friends for 25 years from Staten Island. The whole point is to get honest reactions from themselves and the people involved with the pranks. What makes great shows, no matter the genre? Chemistry and where all of the people have something vital to add in their own way. It's like Always Sunny and Seinfeld in that regard. But it's not scripted ""reality"" nonsense. It's goofy, original, and quick witted. They had a comedy tour before starting in 1999 and finally got their pilot accepted. These guys are great. I can't say which one I like the best because they all add something unique. But the key is the chemistry and the likability. And they are naturally funny. Just watch it.",2016
10,"These guys Are the best , Literally. This show started back in 2011 with with very little hype and look at it now. It's Shining ! Both the 4 Jokers have Admiring Personalities ! Their content is productive and creative ! You can literally see thee hard work. New punishment in almost every episode. How do these guys come up with such ideas ? These guys will be famous in no time ! You can't stop laughing while watching thee show ! I had to pause sometimes , Laugh and then Resume! Keep up the hard work guys , You guys deserve all the love ! Also their latest season 5 is currently the best one, They are coming up with such new ideas . visiting new places and New punishments ! What these guys do is productive , Creative , Entertaining , Funny as Hell !",2016
5,"I was really optimistic going into the theatre, I didn't expect it to as great as the original, but I thought it would still be good movie. But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie.",2011
4,"2009 wasn't exactly the best year for movies, but out of that year we did get a comedy that will last for years to come, The Hangover. When I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I was telling my friends that I had a feeling that this was being made for the money. After all, The Hangover made over 200 million dollars world wide, they are going to milk it for everything that it's worth. Plus what made the first Hangover so great was that as crazy as their night was and outrageous, in some strange way it was believable where we've been so drunk we couldn't remember the night before and somehow did the most insane things. How is this supposed to happen again and be believable? But I loved the first Hangover so much that I went into this just hoping it was going to be a good time and sadly, it was exactly as I feared, this was made for money because it was nothing but copy and paste.",2011
5,"Most people seem to really enjoy The Hangover. It wouldn't be the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time if they didn't, right? The movie also has a fairly solid reputation, as well; certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes along with above average scores just about everywhere else you look. With that said, it's better as a standalone film. Pushing another Hangover film onto the masses would water down and lessen the impact of what made the first film entertaining. The Hangover Part II proves just that and illustrates what a film made solely for money and nothing more really is.",2011
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Two years ago, director Todd Phillips presented a highly creative, hilarious, raunchy, unique film comedy called The Hangover. And now, he does it again. He presents that SAME film again. I am unsure whether this is a sequel or remake. The only substantial change is the setting ... Bangkok instead of Vegas.",2011
4,"I had modest expectations, they weren't met. This is Hollywood milking a successful movie with a contrived followup. This is the same movie. The jokes are the same, just dirtier and more low-brow to get shock reaction. This is like the joke ""the Aristocrats"". Same joke as before, just dirtier and more disgusting. Drug overdoses, kidnapping and hiding bodies as a premise for a comedy isn't entertainment, it's desperation to go ""over the top"" without originality. The interaction with the lady-boys was obvious and a cliché for Bangkok humor. It's the Heather Graham joke from the first movie with a little sodomy mixed into it. The inappropriate observations and comments by Alan that made the first movie clever just push the envelope but don't even feel awkward anymore. If your brand of humor falls along the lines of ""the more disgusting and grotesque the better"" than this is your movie. If you want some creativity and originality for your money, don't bother.

6,"Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.",2011
4,"The Hangover was a surprise hit in 2009 that went on to be not only a critically acclaimed film, but also a huge box office success. The Hangover Part 2 is exactly the same movie except this one takes place in Bangkok, and isn't nearly as good or as funny as the first film.",2011
3,"In a classic case of going to the well just once too often, ""Hangover, Part II"" should be a lesson to all directors and screenwriters that what sets a successful sequel apart is SOME kind of divergence from the original movie's plot.",2011
5,"If you loved the original, then you will love this one. The reason being is that part II is the carbon copy of its predecessor, and reinforces the idea that laziness is running rampant throughout Hollywood. Lets rundown the similarities, shall we: 1-Movie starts out with Stu's wedding in Thailand. 2-The men wake up and don't remember a thing. 3-Stu hasn't lost a tooth this time, he has a face tattoo. 4-No baby, but an adorable coke snorting, cigarette smoking monkey. 5-Doug isn't missing, but the bride's younger brother Teddy. 6-No missing tooth this time, but a missing finger, which just so happens to belong to Teddy. 7-Follow a hot lead to find Teddy, but it turns out to be a Buddhist monk (black Doug reference). 8-In order to piece together the previous night, the guys head to a strip club run by the very same guy that ran the Wedding Chapel from part one. 9-It is also at the strip club, like the chapel in part one, that we learn that Stu is cheating on his fiancé-part one was a stripper, this time a stripper with a weiner! 10-Then the return of Teddy lays in the hands of Mr Chow and him transferring money to a Russian mobster who supposedly has custody of Teddy, just as Mr. Chow supposedly had custody of Doug in the original, with neither having custody of their supposed missing friends. 11-The phone call from Phil claiming they had F*&*ed up. 12-Just as in the original, Stu has an epiphany and figures out where Teddy is, stuck in the hotel elevator. 13-The guys make it to the wedding just in time. 14-The guys end the film sitting together when Teddy finds his phone and all the pictures that they are going to all look at once, but then delete. Its funny, sure, but it's really just embarrassing to come to terms with the knowledge that these writers think that the viewers of this movie are so stupid that they won't mind the similarities. I say similarities, but it's just down right the same movie in a different city. My response to the writers and to the director Todd Philips is, How dare you?! Didn't you make a butt load of money? Didn't this movie get nominated for a ton of awards? You couldn't afford some real writers? Or did you just not care enough about your viewers to give us something different?",2011
6,"What made The Hangover fun and entertaining unfortunately leads to predicatability in The Hangover II. The only reason I got any enjoyment out of this movie at all was because I liked the characters in the first movie. I wish they had tried to do something fresh with the story and the characters, but it was the same old gags.",2011
6,"Remember that one movie that came out in 2009 called The Hangover? Of course you do. It was only one of the most talked about films of the summer, surprising everyone as one of the funniest comedies in a long time. Two years later it was only fitting that a sequel be made so that we could relive the original Hangover fervor and kick off summer 2011 with a bang. Well, the basic rule of thumb for a sequel is that it either a) needs to be a continuation of the story from the first film or b) tell a new story with the same characters. The Hangover Part II decided to invent their own option c) which is to tell the exact same story all over again, but just changing a few details.",2011

First of all, as others have stated this movie is just a copy/paste screen job from the original most brilliant piece of comedy I've seen in a while.

1,"Hmmm, where to begin? I'm guilty of laughing out loud while watching the first hangover, I have to admit. Therefore I have the capacity to enjoy silly comedies...but this...this was painful to watch. The humour was really low quality, as if the writers did not give a flying truck about a viewer. It was in fact so bad that I felt embarrassed for them. In general they used the oldest (and least funny) stereotypes, the stupidest jokes, and the cheapest tricks. Let's take the scene with a monkey smoking a fag. How was exploitation of this animal funny? Yes, 'no animals were harmed during the making of this movie' (probably) so what? What is the message they are sending across? Entertainment it is not. Is Thailand really just lady-boys, drugs, fakes and huge disparity between very rich and very poor? Maybe...But rather than exploiting this painful reality they should stigmatise it in my opinion (Monty Python style!). Instead, a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I sometimes enjoy silly stuff-who doesn't-but this film was disrespectful: 'just take the horse poo we serve and shut up'. There is nothing else to write about this movie except: don't pay for it it is sooo not worth your money. I would certainly give it a zero on a voting scale.",2011
2,"When i first heard about the hangover 2 i was thrilled and i wanted to see it. i just watched it and i want my 15 dollars back. It started out funny and then it just stopped. And by the end of the movie i was shocked that i dislike this movie so much because i absolutely loved the first one. I didn't dislike it because it was just like the first one (only in Bangkok), i disliked it cause it was not funny and it had no originality like the first one did. And what happens to poor Stu is not funny at all. So in closing, do not go see this film. You will hardly laugh and you will just wanna walk out halfway through the movie. So please don't be like me and millions of other people, don't waste your money.",2011
9,"I recently caught up with Hangover II during an early press screening held in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it was by far one of the best films I've seen all year - and most definitely the best comedy. After being horribly disappointed by The Dilemma, grinned occasionally at Hall Pass and Just Go With It (but not really carried away by either), it was about time we got a decent 2011 comedy - and here it is.",2011
1,"Quite possibly one of the worse films of 2011, (and its been a bad year for films) with out doubt the most over rated so far, Where do I start? the reason the first one was so good was because of how original the concept of the film was, so using it again for part 2 takes away the feeling of watching a new idea, part 2 was just a carbon copy, pretty much a scene for scene remake with slightly different jokes, there were quite a few things that in particular annoyed me 1, smoking monkey! just not cool 2,everything was in the trailer and merchandise, from Stu's awful tattoo too knowing Mr chow was alive all the time because the trailer told us so, the vast of Alans funny bits...... also in the trailer 3, predictable, OK so they in Bangkok, there was only a matter of time before we see a 'ladyboy' and given how the film lacked anything remotely funny there was only a matter of time before we get to see the proof that Stu's prostitute wasn't quite what he thought, this is just one of so many jokes that was so predictable because straight from the off you know where this film is going 4, I'd be pretty annoyed if i lost some fingers, (couldnt tell how many he lost) 5, there was no Mel Gibson cameo on account of Zach Galifianakis protesting about his past racist slurs........ this film was racist from beginning to end 6, Phil...... quite possibly the most annoying character I've ever seen, if this blokes hates his job so much then why is he a teacher? he comes across as a clever guy who could talk himself into pretty much any job he wants, he hates his family yet in part 2 we see him with a new baby, would have been better off he got locked in toilet with the tiger in the first one this list could easily reach 20 points but the more i think about the film the more i hate it, so a few more things i hated, swapping the baby from the fist one with a monk, how did Stu manage to pull Jamie Chung, Mr chow in general, Alan's evil side towards Stu's new bother in law, Alan just shouldn't have a nasty side... thats it for now, hope you enjoyed my first review, and i apologise for any spelling mistakes or grammar errors, its never been my strong point",2011

1,"I really liked the first movie, because it was very funny without being mean spirited, and had the right level of rudeness. I was excited to see this, not expecting it to be very good but expecting it to be fun at least. I was wrong. In this inevitable sequel, the wolf pack go to Thailand for Stu's wedding and after another disastrous bachelor party they wake up in a hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of last night and the younger brother of Stu's fiancée goes missing and they have to find him. Is any of this sounding familiar? If so, I'm not surprised since this is literally the exact same as the first movie. But there are a few small differences such as it's a monkey instead of a tiger and they're in Bangkok instead of Vegas. The biggest difference is that while the first was hilarious fun this is a nasty, repugnant, pathetic, numbingly unfunny, abysmally written, lazy, mean spirited and utterly unbearable stink-bomb of a sequel that's more disturbing than funny.",2014
8,"Hangover Part II: Film Review Hangover Part II. what a great film, yet another fantastic storyline. People doubted whether or not it could top the previous film, and if the sequel would ruin the originality of the previous film... they thought wrong. Part II is still the same idea, they all go out loose there memory etc etc, but Part II offers so much more comedy and thrill, there is more at stake this time, more too loose. It was great to see the ""wolf pack"" back together but unfortunately Doug was not in the whole drama again, he went home early, it would have been nice to see him get more involved in the film. This time they do not live the high life glamour like they did in Vegas, they were in Bangkok, there seemed to be a much darker and depressing tone in the movie, they wake up in the grotty, dirty hotel were all the power goes off, they find themselves in the slums of bangkok. the film gets much more graphic, near the beginning and throughout there are strong drug uses and strong sexual actions and nudity. I would say that this film is really a teenage humor, for 15 to 28 maybe but adults will enjoy just as much To sum up this film i would say it is a fantastic must see, its got to be comedy film of the year, its going to win loads of Oscars and just a general fun and fantastic film to watch. A must see film. i give it ******** stars (please comment and rate my review :)for more of my reviews visit http://review-cahill.blogspot.com/2011/06/hangover-part-ii-film- review.html",2011
9,"After seeing The Hangover in 2009, I could not wait for Part II to be released and it was worth it. I really don't get why people are saying this movie sucks because it has the same plot. What do they expect? Of course Todd Phillips is gonna use the same formula as the original but it works with this one. I can honestly say while Phillips did take this one a step up with how crude and nasty the jokes are, it still made me fall out of my seat laughing, especially Alan's new attitude in this. To me, the only thing that would make The Hangover Part II a failure is if Alan was the one the trio ended up losing the night before. Without him, The Hangover movies would suck! Sure, we got Phil's sarcasm and the craziness of Ed Helms but Alan is the one with it all. Overall, I give it a 9/10.",2011
8,Let me preface this by saying I have seen all the episodes of the BBC version. I love it. I also love the new US version.,2011
8,"To me TV has been a little boring of late... If it isn't forensics then it's reality or cooking shows - too much... So, if you are looking for a fun sci-fi fantasy to keep your attention, this just may do the trick. It's weird, a little quirky and dramatic to boot... Hopefully we will see some romantic possibility with Aiden and Sally - because to me that seems like a perfect match. Aiden doesn't want to kill anyone and well, Sally can't die again... So, vampire+ghost=love...",2011
10,"I've kept right up with all of the episodes, and the characters have grown nicely. Anyone who can be critical after just one or two episodes is not a critic. I decided to watch the British version after I began watching this one, and, frankly, I decided not to watch it again. I'm very satisfied with the characters in the U.S., and the acting is excellent, as far as I'm concerned, with just the right amount of humor, which is delivered well, and the expected (and sometimes not) horror action that goes with it. The show is unique, as far as I am concerned, and I put it in a class with ""Supernatural"", which is at the top of my list for good entertainment and acting. People need to decide for themselves rather than have someone promote another version that they have become over-familiar with. It becomes like ""the movie just can't compare to the book"". I love British TV, but, in this instance, it can't compare to this version, and I'll stay a dedicated fan for what I hope is a long run. Thanks, SYFY!",2011
10,"I have only a seen few scenes of the UK version, so I can't compare very well. However, I do know what I like, and I LOVE the US version! I do want to see more of the UK version, but at this point in time the US Being Human has been firmly cemented as my favorite, even if it is not the original. The first thing that caught my eye is that even though it is about werewolves and vampires, it did not feel like a Twilight or Vampire Diaries type show. I am much more into shows like Supernatural, as opposed to the fantasy-horror shows/movies with all the teen angst. There is angst here, but it's from an adult point of view, which is much more relatable to me. Josh was the first person to stand out to me. I saw a commercial about the characters and he was so awkward and quirky, I just fell in love. I love Aidan and Sally as well, I think all the characters are very engaging, and I really care about them and want to see what is going to happen with them.",2011
10,"Being Human is a breath of fresh air for the whole ""Creatures of the Night"" genre. If you think it's just another Twilight rip-off I'm gonna stop you right there. Aiden is not just some Edward. He's believable as a Vampire. When he's jonesing for some blood he looks like he's going to puke and start ripping out his hair. His love interests, unlike in some other vampire shows, are based either on him acting like a normal human being (with humans) or drugs (with vampires). Blood is crack to him. He's not a monster, really (none of them are). He's just a very old drug addict. He's also hilarious. (""Really? The vampire bit doesn't freak you out but the male nurse thing does?"") Josh is a brilliant werewolf. He's a stereotypical Jewish man and former honor student with OCD. He had everything; close friends, loving well- to-do family and the girl of his dreams. But every full moon now his heart stops, his organs fail, his skin rips apart and every bone breaks and relocates itself and he must suffer through every last second and give his mind up to a serial killer (who looks awesome by the way). He lost everything and it's obvious to see why. He's also hilarious. (""Great, we're living with Sally the peeper ghost"") And Sally is just plain lovable. She a free-spirit who had everything to live for but ended up living more dead with her new friends than she ever did alive. Ghost have the obvious trait of going insane if they stick around for too long. They also have many addictive abilities that look fun but are incredibly dangerous. The second season will have a plot twist that will make your head spin with delight. Sally has many problems to deal with being a ghost. But hopefully her loving friends will keep her sane. She's also hilarious. (""You two gonna go all Twilight on each other at some point?"" - ""I'm not a peeper... much... I would get that mole checked out if I were you."") These are just real, likable people under extraordinarily circumstances. ",2012
8,"This is show is great. I know there's so much werewolf and vampire movies and shows being thrown about now days but this breaks away from the brooding vampire werewolf combo. You have a serious but humorous vampire living with a puppy dog faced and funny werewolf living together in a house with a ghost who can't move on. The cast is pretty dang good in my book. They all have a chemistry that makes you believe their actually real life friends. You have some eye candy and also a great plot and storyline. It's not all about hot vampires and werewolves beating each other up for a girl...to be honest it's nothing like that, but it draws you in with the drama. You forget that their superhuman but people going through some difficult times. It's fun to watch...you'll laugh and may even relate. Also if your a big fan of syfy, you'll love tuning in to watch 45 mins of fantasy, drama, and humor. Don't shoot it down till you choose to sit down and watch it with arms open and enjoy.",2011
7,"I just watched the American Being Human and I have a confession. I liked it. I prefer the BBC version but I liked the American Being Human. If you're not familiar with it the plot of Being Human is about supernatural creatures that secretly live among us and a werewolf, vampire and ghost share a place together while trying to pass as human. That's the plot of both the BBC version and the American version in a nut shell. When it first started the voice over gave me this uneasy pseudo-intellectual impression of talking down to the viewer with simplistic while terms trying to sound deep, a major turn off for me. But it gradually got better. The main plot is very obviously taken from the early 2008 Being Human pilot from BBC 3, the major differences start with the character names and the supernatural powers.",2011
10,"I give it 10 stars because it is perfection in the art of storytelling. I am an American viewer, and I prefer the American cast. Let me first say that if you are like me, you haven't watched Twilight saga or True Blood and generally you feel sick of vampires at the mere mention. That said, what made me tune in to Being Human? I saw the ad on a city bus and it struck my curiosity. I looked into it and loved the premise - modern roommates, cursed in 3 different ways, all trying to be normal. I watched the pilot and fell in love. This series has been at the top of my list since. I can't wait for it to start again, and it kills me when a season ends - always a great cliffhanger!",2013
8,"I have to say that Being Human took time to grow on me and at times I felt I was being led down a path that would leave me sorry I had wasted my time watching the show. I read this sentiment in many reviews articulated in various ways, but the bottom line is Being Human is a very good show, however it isn't until its over that you truly appreciate the show for what it was and is because the end is not sloppy, hacked, or rushed. It simply brings a lot more meaning to the previous seasons and makes you appreciate the whole show a great deal more. At that final place is when you truly engage all that the show brought you through and makes you appreciate the idea behind the story and realize it is much more than you thought while on the ride.",2014
3,"I fell in love with the original version of this show. I can understand why they needed it to have a little more appropriate content but I felt like I was just watching the watered down Hollywoodized version of the original. I have never been able to understand why they make remakes of things yet change the characters names even though we know who they were in the other version. They didn't change the plot very much and in fact the beginning scene with Aidan practically mirrors the original. I have a friend who watched the pilot of this version and she said she felt as though she was watching one of the episodes from later in the season, because she felt that nothing was fully explained. They added random stuff (Josh's sister) but they didn't keep in the stuff that needs to be in a pilot. I found that I was disappointed with Aidan's(Mitchell-original) overall look. I am so tired of vampires that looked different from normal humans. He is all pale, broody, and gives off hind of creepy bad guy vibe. The British version is slightly more sexual, without nudity, and violent than this one but if you think that you are mature enough to get past that, then I think that it would be more beneficial to experience the show in its true and greatest form.",2011
2,"BUT without the good acting, humor, scripts, direction, and film editing.",2011
2,"This is so typical of SYFY. It announced over and over that this was a new and ""Original"" SYFY series. I don't think so!! What they actually did was take a popular series from the BBC, use the same title and basic characters....but then hire so many untalented actors, directors and you name it. What's left is yet another cheaply made series that couldn't hold my attention past the first half-hour (I did watch it to write this review).",2011
8,"Amazingly entertaining show for everyone. A good combination of supernatural characters in one house is a brilliant idea. They just want to be as normal as possible and we experience their struggles with life. It is so much fun to watch all three. Plus, the actors and actresses are very talented. Josh (Sam H.) is my favorite and I personally met with Sam Witwer who is quite a humble and funny guy. I love them all. I think everyone should seriously consider watching the episodes. The content is decent and both the action and drama are well presented. I was about to cry in the 2nd season ep.12. Well, I highly recommend this series for everyone.",2013
2,"During one of my many down days I stumbled across this on an online TV links site and I had to say I was most interested, so I decided to give it a go with an open mind.",2011
2,"Like all the other reviewers, I must agree that the US copy of Being Human is too much like the BBC Original. Even our US ghost was wearing the same white and gray top! Then, there's the acting. Our US trio were not quite believable. Each one seemed to be acting on their own and could not even relate with each other. The viewer could not feel the connection between the characters. This is where the original succeeds. The viewer sympathized with their plight of trying to be human. And, they supported each other, even confronting danger for friendship's sake. BBC's Season 3 has just started and, I must say, came in really strong with it's original theme of human relationship and friendships. Lenora Crichlow (Annie) is a sight for sore eyes!",2011
10,"I'm so far on the 10th episode of Season 1, and gotta say just awesome as hell. I've watched both US/Canadian and UK versions, in my opinion US/Canadian version to better. You can't hate it cause it has vampires and werewolves and think it will be like Twilight, your stupid nothing like Twilight. This show is 100x better then Twilight.",2012
3,"I Give This a Three out of ten. They Tried. They really did but its not working. I gave the show a look at and I was bored to death in the first ten minutes. It never grasped my attention, It's as if I was watching a Documentary on Dust and Pollen. The American version lacks character or sense of witty humor. The Actors are of somewhat C-graded Stars. Not saying they suck but hey they probably beat plenty of others for this gig! (a hint of Sarcasm) The characters seem so distant from one another...not really creating that atmosphere of which the BBC version creates. Now I'm a Proud American but this remake is pure crap. The British executes their Version with no worries of Competition.",2011
2,"Since nothing else was on TV, rather than pop in a Movie/Show I decided to give SciFi's (SyFy is still dumb) new show Being Human a try. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. There are/were so many things wrong with this show that it's a wonder Scifi still makes original programming. Considering this is a Canadian version of a British Show can it really be called Original Programming. ",2011
4,But this is at least trying. I don't feel i can make a proper judgement as for the first episode i was just watching different people do the same thing i'd seen three years ago. I'd be interested to see whether the characters are going to go in completely different directions than the BBC version because then i might be able to make a judgement based on their individual merits. But at the moment it just seems like a copy with differences which are just a little too small.,2011
10,"I've watched both the US and the BBC versions of this show and I must say that I enjoyed the US version better. Not that the UK version isn't amazing, because it is very very good. I just think there are so many fantastical problems and continuity issues in the UK version that sometimes I can't help but laugh.",2011
3,"I watched every episode of this series because I was bored, and I watched it after I'd already seen the UK version. In the UK version my heart was in my throat during several episodes as people fought and struggled, and almost got caught, and experienced the highs and lows of the things they'd done. The guy who plays Mitchell (the vampire) is fantastic!! Then I watched the U.S. version. It was just so incredibly dull and boring, and stereotypical, and the guy who plays the vampire in this version, can't hold a candle to Mitchell. He's too busy trying to play it calm and cool, where as Mitchell lets us have it all! I was right on board with all of the suspense in the UK version, and the US version just fails to deliver in every single way. I seriously recommend that you don't even watch the US version unless you are bored like I was, and have nothing better to do.",2012

9,We saw it tonight with about 30 friends at a pre-release screening in Atlanta. ,2011
9,"I lucked out and received tickets to watch an advance screening of this movie. I had 0 expectations, the trailer didn't really show much, and generally went in with an open mind.",2011
7,"It's been a long wait, but finally, for the first time since 2007 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once again as the unstoppably funny duo. Their pairing this time isn't quite at the same quality of comedy as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead but let's face it, those two movies are comedy gold. Paul is still hilarious and it is rife with highly quotable jokes that you can laugh about for days. Plus it has plenty of great nerdy sci-fi humor that only us true geeks and catch on to. Paul follows two British tourists in America, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) who are traveling cross-country to visit all of the most famous UFO sightings in America. While in Area 51 they pick up a hitchhiking alien named Paul who is excellently voiced by Seth Rogen. Graeme and Clive quickly learn that agreeing to protect this extraterrestrial is giving them a lot more than they bargained for as they are chased by the FBI, hillbillies, and a religious shotgun toting nut job.",2011
8,"From the trailers, I had come to expect quite a lot from the movie. Actually I had thought and believed the movie to be more than it actually was when I was done watching it. Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad or dull, far from it. The movie is pretty cool and fun, though there is nothing overly new and inventive about it. And that is what sort of made the movie a bit tame.",2011
8,"Shaun of the Dead – great. Hot Fuzz – brilliant. Paul, The third collaboration between the two best friends Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is another action-packed comedy featuring an alien, guns, and Jason Bateman. Unlike the previous films the pair starred in, Paul still has the strong bromance between the two but takes a turn to be more of what Scott Pilgrim Vs the World was instead of Hot Fuzz.",2011
8,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit, it is a rare comedy that started kind of slowly, but continued to get more funny as it went on. Usually I find a lot of comedies start kind of fast then fade out kind of fast. This one has two Brits who are in the United States for comic con, the end all comic book, science fiction, horror and a whole heck of a lot more conventions. These particular two are into aliens and there to not only take in the sights and meet a favorite author, but to drive to some of the famous alien spots out in the west. Well they quickly run into some trouble with some local rednecks and then end up witnessing a very bad wreck. They go out to explore the scene and end up meeting Paul, an alien who is apparently on the run and in the need of assistance. During the course of their adventure the two Brits must keep Paul hidden from government agents and also deal with crazy religious fathers and all sorts of other things one tends to find on the road. Probably why I liked this one as I always enjoy a good traveling comedy of which this can certainly be classified as one. I also enjoy watching Simon Pegg and Nick Frost working together as they have a good chemistry. They are a couple of the few actors who I will watch a movie specifically because they are in it. I used to have a whole slew of actors and actresses like that, but these days not so much. The comedy is funny, like I said it started a bit slowly as I think the comic con scenes could have been a bit funnier, but it really got going once they met up with Paul. Not much of a Seth Rogen fan, but he did a fine job as the voice of Paul. So all in all a funny comedy that kept me entertained throughout.",2011
8,I loved this movie. Have been a fan of Pegg and Frost since Shaun of the Dead and enjoy their genius ability to spoof a genre and still make a thoroughly entertaining and funny movie,2011
2,"The thing about Spaced, Shaun, and Hot Fuzz is that they are actually funny. They are well written, energetically performed, and knowingly well-read in the medium of pop culture. PAUL sadly, does not fall into any of those categories, and the absence of Edgar Wright is quite palpable. In a nutshell, it's an incredibly lame plot, with tired, forced performances from Pegg and Frost doing a watered down version of their double act. A substantial amount of the humour is taken up with two running 'gags', namely a comic cover featuring an alien with three tits, and people mistaking them for being gay, because they are two men travelling together in an RV. Get it?? I'll pause so you can finish laughing.",2011
4,"Best friends Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are a pair of science-fiction geeks, travelling across America in a mobile RV. They first visit the Comic-Con convention and then move through the Nevada Desert because they are interested in the supposed alien sightings. Along the way they witness a car crash on the side of the road. Investigating the vehicle, they meet Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), a foul mouthed and obnoxious alien. While he happens to share a lot of the same eating habits as the pair, he also has special healing powers. Paul reveals he has escaped from Area 51, after being held a prisoner. He needs the boys to help take him to an extraction point so he can return home. Along the way the group is chased by some government troops, including Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and a father and daughter pair of Christian extremists. The girl is Ruth (Kristen Wiig) and when she ends up on the RV Graeme takes a liking to her. ",2011
8,When you go into a movie starring buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) you know what to expect with their type of films.,2011
6,"My hubby and I were looking forward to seeing ""Paul"". We thought Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were hysterical (especially for the great performance of Elvis the Swan). We enjoyed ""Paul"" but we didn't find it as funny as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's earlier films. We thought it was a gentle comedy, about right for a Sunday afternoon.",2011
1,"Im going to make this brief because I found this whole experience too painful to relive. Paul is a movie about a foul mouthed alien who crash lands on earth for 60 years until he escapes & is picked up by two vacationing English men on their way back from Comic-con. The men in question are Nick Frost & Simon Pegg & rather get into an extensive essay of their career lets just say that Paul is one short of their usual creative process. The other piece of the puzzle missing here is Edgar Wright. For the record I love Scott Pilgrim. Anway Paul right look I get what Pegg & Frost were aiming for but it just doesn't work. Greg Mottola subs for Wright & up until this point I had nothing against his resume. I liked Adventureland & Superbad was entertaining. So I went into Paul with no objections or expectations. I just wanted to laugh & enjoy myself regardless of any reservations lurking beneath the surface sans Wright. However after 45 minutes of just being beaten over the head with crude language & oh yeah Seth Rogen as Paul smoking it up every few seconds I know what a stretch right! This shtick ran its course with Pinapple Express & recently ruined Green Hornet. Enough already. Im not against dumb humor or light hearted fare but this material is beneath Frost & Pegg. This reminds me of my youth all over again. Great comedians being reduced to disposable entertainment. Pryor,Cosby,Carlin & so on. Look I know you've got to put food on the table or maybe you want to reach a broader audience so you make a few crowd pleasers but come on. Apart from Star Trek Simon Pegg has been flying solo in one easy to swallow movie after another. OK fine not my thing but its separate enough from that world he helped create that it doesn't damage its credibility. Teaming up with Frost for a third go is a definite grab towards that geek demographic & yet what we get is something more suitable for the masses. Call me naive but this feels deceptive. Do your crap movies for whatever reason but don't bait the fans who have supported you since Spaced. Im not big on the theory that one bad movie or album sinks someones career so on that note lets move on.I hope the fourth time around overshadows the third.",2011

10,"Holy mother of alien, what an amazing cast. I have never before been surprised by a movie so much. Didn't really know anything about the movie before I've seen it and it turned out to be pretty unique. I mean a religion-bashing comedy with a couple of geeks, an alien and explosions? Slap me with a donkey beard.",2011
1,Paul is a dud.,2011
3,"Graeme and Clive are best mates; they are also comic book nerds on a dream trip from England to the US and after attending a comic-con they head off on a road trip to see some famous alien sites. Their trip takes a surprising turn however when after a car accident they meet Paul, an alien. The pair help Paul who is trying to get back to his own planet after being held by the government. Along the way they pick up bible bashing Ruth who quickly becomes an alien believer and the foursome travel in an RV to the meeting point, all the while being chased by Federal Agents, Police and Ruth's dad most of whom want Paul dead.",2011
6,"First of all, I love big train, spaced, shaun of the dead and hot fuzz, and maybe i had too high expectations of Paul, but it is the weakest thing Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have done to date.",2011
1,"This movie was very disappointing. A mediocre plot plummeted to terrible very quickly. According to this movie, anyone who believes in God is an idiot. It goes out of its way to portray Christians as intolerant, ignorant backwoods folk. It is one thing to support evolution and atheism. It is another thing entirely to demean and insult anyone who believes otherwise. Exalting yourself by tearing others down is juvenile and cruel.",2011
5,"So Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up for the third time to dish up another comic fun fest (or so I thought) after the great Shaun of the Dead and the hilarious Hot Fuzz. I have always in particular liked Simon Pegg in Run Fatboy Run, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People and he was the best thing doing the voice-over of the memorable animation character Buck in Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, so I am a fan of his, but I'm afraid Paul is his poorest film yet.",2011

10,"Johnny English is back! The film kicks off swiftly indeed, with English being retrained for service. If there is one impressive thing, the pacing is spot on. Whilst the first film lent more towards witty dialog, Reborn relies more on visual gags. Standout sequences include English on a gadget powered wheelchair racing down the streets of London, along with the majority of action scenes. The chair gag in Mi7 is also most welcome. The music composer must be commended for a rousing score, frequently referencing the Johnny English Theme, particularly during the splendid opening titles sequence. The cast is solid, particularly Rosamund Pike. Whilst Ben Miller does not appear unfortunately, Daniel Kaluuya does an average job of replacing the sidekick role as Agent Tucker. The other performances are pretty spot on.",2011
7,"Okay, I just saw Johnny English Reborn. It was excellent as a comedy. It had lots of funny moments.",2011
10,"This movie is damn funny. I didn't watch the first show, but I can assure you, when I went to watch it yesterday at 21.15, all shows from 20.45, 21.00, 21.15, 21.30, 21.45 were full. Also, during the parts where Mr Bean just talked something funny, the whole theatre was laughing. I almost threw my popcorn up into the air during the chair shrinking part, and my dad choked on his drink. The whole movie is funny and not in a lowbrow way like most movies you see nowadays with disgusting sex or poop jokes. It has the British humour. And the opening scenes imitate the parkour one in James Bond but it is much more realistic. I think, if you don't set your expectations too high, you will find it above your expectations.",2011

6,"Johnny English Reborn is a comedy spy-thriller with Rowan Atkinson as inept secret agent versus a nasty organization called Vortex . It maintains the slapstick franchise including a good cast as Gillian Amstrong , Rosamund Pike , Dominic West and professionally directed by Oliver Parker . In his latest adventure, the most unlikely intelligence officer in Her Majesty's Secret Service is recruited by MI7 and must stop a group of international assassins before they eliminate a world leader and cause global chaos. Now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English goes into the action . In the years since MI-7's top spy vanished off the grid, he has been honing his unique skills in a remote region of Asia. But when his agency superiors learn of an attempt against the Chinese premier's life, they must hunt down the highly unorthodox agent. Now that the world needs him once again, maladroit klutz Johnny English is back in action. With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout the KGB, CIA and even MI-7. With mere days until a heads of state conference, one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English who stumbles through cases like a bull in a factory , disaster may be an option, but failure never is and he invariably and usually by accident manages to solves them . ",2012
4,"OK, can someone please help me understand why this film is getting 10 out of 10's? Im sorry, but I was a big fan of the first Johhny English. Without being too cynical, I thought it was good fun and gave you a few laughs, but I wasn't too sure whether there would be a sequel or not. Surprise surprise there wasn't and that was fine, they left it and it still stands well a few years on. However when Johhny English was announced this year, one thing popped into my mind ' oh great, Hollywood are cashing in again' just like on all the other sequels and remakes they've done year's after the originals. Now don't get me wrong there are some really good things about this movie. Firstly, some of the humour is very good: the meeting scene with the chair, the first meeting with the head of the spy organisation, some of the party scenes with the mistaken old lady and the fight scene with the man who uses loads of stunts to run from Johhny, whereas Rowan Atkinson just casually chases him using amusing stunts.",2011

1,"One of the worst movies i saw this year. I cannot believe why i let my friends persuade me to spend 9 Euros (for the cinema ticket) to watch it. The humorous scenes are so stretched out and so intentional that are not funny any more, all the actors are over-acting in a way that it's like trying to tell you ""now...i'm going to do something funny now, be ready to laugh"" and the sounds & music were so loud that i couldn't at least take a nap until it's over.",2011
5,"I literally just finished watching this movie with my dad and brother, came out rather disappointed.",2011
5,"I wish I could rate this higher. I also wish I had enjoyed it more. I don't think my hopes were unreasonably high; I was a huge fan of the first film, but I know sequels often don't measure up so I tried to keep that in mind even as I ducked out of work 15 minutes early yesterday afternoon to catch the first show. It was okay. And yet, Rowan Atkinson is capable of so much more than being ""okay"". What went wrong here? Well, the story didn't hold together as well as the first film. The gags weren't as creative. The writing lacked spark. There was zero chemistry between Johnny and the ""love interest"". The sidekick had no personality and might as well not have been there. In general I found the film very predictable, and that's kind of sad because I usually can't see things coming a mile away when everyone else can. Maybe it's because I've been a Rowan Atkinson fan for a long time and I can sense when a situation is being set up to accommodate a piece of his shtick. At times it felt almost as if the writers had a checklist of pieces of business to write scenes for. Facial tics? Check. Numb-lip babble? Check. Etc., etc.",2011
7,"I have no idea why the sequel to the funny Johnny English took at least 8 years to be made. I am surprised that there're no Direct-To-DVD sequels (It is smart not to). Guess what.

Surprisingly, Singapore has this faster than in U.K and USA.",2011

7,"Silly spies and comical cops are always a welcome treat to chase those blues away as far as my record goes, from the likes of Frank Drebin to Austin Powers , perhaps there is none other than Rowan Atkinson's Johnny English, a misfit of British Intelligence, that was much maligned when first unleashed into the world back in 2003. Atkinson is better known throughout the world as Mr Bean, his most successful creation to date, but his Johnny English didn't receive as much love, so a sequel to the film is somewhat surprising, yet anticipated because of Atkinson's prolonged absence from the big screen.",2011

7,"Took my two kids, 14 and 12 to see this at a free preview in Wimbledon (had to fill in a form afterwards) and honestly, both boys nearly fell off their seats laughing, and I have to be honest and admit to laughing to quite a few bits as well, it all comes down to Rowan Atkinson who seems to have cornered the Slapstick market, there are LOTS of visual gags, the trailer doesn't do the movie justice and there are lots of set pieces, it certainly isn't going to win any Oscars but the last scene had the whole cinema in near hysterics laughing - the disjointed body bit must have been very difficult to act but he pulled it off splendidly, well worth going to see on a rainy Saturday afternoon, the kids will thank you :)",2011
8,"There are so many things right about this movie, the little things that are wrong are easily forgiven. Some slight plot holes, but the film and characters make up for it.

9,"Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (""King Kong"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"") for special effects. ""Apes"" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.",2011
9,"To sum it up, a very powerful film falling just short of being a masterpiece. However, the only flaw in the film is that the film could have been just a bit longer! I am really hoping for a director's cut because there should have been a few more character development scenes between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend, and even Ape and Human. I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly but nevertheless, still contains very fleshed out characters driven by excellent performances throughout, from Lithgow, to Franco, to Cox and especially by Andy Serkis.",2011
8,"The one thing that always made the ""Planet of the Apes"" a bit campy was actors in make up and monkey suits. So in one instance, here's where technology, specifically the use motion- capture technology as seen in ""Avatar,"" can almost single-handedly justify revisiting an old franchise. But the apes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" don't just look amazing — they have souls. So does this script, which delivers one of the summer's biggest surprises in terms of pure entertainment and depth of storytelling.",2011
8,There was a lot of hype going into this film. I was very excited to finally see another Planet of the Apes film. I am a big fan of the original and had fun with the sequels and even after Tim Burton's remake I was still excited for this film and I got to say this is the best Planet of the Apes picture since the original.,2011
9,"To begin on a tangent before evaluating the film, before summer 2011, I had not seen a decent prequel film. Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.",2011
8,"Summer 2011 will go down in history as one of the more disappointing seasons in many years when it comes to movies. This is the time of year that people rush out in masses to see the latest action extravaganza, and to be fair, some films have delivered on that promise -- ""Harry Potter,"" ""Captain America"" (though I have yet to see either of them and am simply relying on general reactions) -- but there's been a whole lot of disappointments, too, and the worst part is that people still seem to be flocking to them, almost out of necessity than wont (""Transformers 3"" and ""Pirates 4"" both made over $1 bil worldwide, which is amazing, because they both sucked).",2011
7,"...but it didn't do it for me. I'm a huge fan of the series (excluding the Tim Burton disaster, of course) but this didn't have nearly the depth nor the intelligence I was expecting. Like most I was initially skeptical at the idea of attempting to reboot the franchise -- but as positive reviews kept flowing in regarding this ""smart"" script and Avatar-like CGI, I began to get excited again. With the surprisingly high box office numbers and positive feedback from most who saw it, I got more excited.",2011
9,"Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one?

Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.",2011
5,I've no idea how I managed to miss RISE . It came out three years ago and I recall it going on my watch it when it comes out on DVD list but never got round to it for some reason . Now that the sequel DAWN has opened to almost universal praise it's very timely that Channel 4 decided to give it its British TV network broadcast . I saw the trailers on channel 4 last week and made sure I wasn't going to miss it and if I enjoyed this film I might just go out of my way and spend money watching the sequel in the cinema . Hmmmm . After seeing RISE it looks like I've just saved myself the price of a bus ride and a cinema ticket ,2014
4,"Hollywood is losing ideas. We already know that. Now we are stuck having remakes, reboots, & prequels. And what's worse, most of these prequels are hardly connected to the original film & sometimes they say it's a reboot. The film? It can be entertaining in some parts, but mostly it's a wooden & clichéd sci-fi story. Convoluted from the original Planet of the Apes series but like they say, This could be a reboot. Any new ideas, Hollywood?",2011

2,"2011 is probably the year of the worst movies made ever. That said, in my personal ranking the Rise of the Planet of the Apes is hands down the worst one of the bunch. There is no real plot, the story is naive to heck and back. It's basically a patchwork of familiar themes which goes like that: Evil (greedy) corporation experiments on apes seeking profit, great noble doctor trying to find cure for Alzheimer to save his father, ape gets smarter, ape gets angry, ape unites the apes, steal serum and makes them smarter, apes beat the (censored) out of the SFPD and find freedom. Oh, and there's this evil ape which you'd think would confront the good ape, but at around 2/3 of the movie producer decides that they should leave room for a sequel (God forbid!) and the last vestiges of a plot wither and die. Oh, did I mention the hot chick which has no role or purpose? Check.",2011
1,"What???!!!???? 8 points out of 10 for this crap??? Something's HORRIBLY wrong with IMDb, definitely... Is everyone mad?? Or are just apes voting here? Sorry, but I can't take it. The movie is a failure at all levels, starting with the hackneyed, formulaic script. It seems to me it was written out of those computer programs that tell you the exact moment for a plot point, a catalyst, an inciting incident, a subplot second act or you name it. Garbage. From the very first second of the movie you KNOW exactly what's going to happen and how things are going to develop for the rest of the movie. And that's NOT my idea for a good (or even passable) script!! Not to mention the feeble characters. Let's take a look at them: -the good scientist, played with his usual blandness by James Franco, -the beauty love interest (I suppose she is Hindu in order to attract moviegoers from that ""emergent"" market...), who happens to also be wise (surely she studied in the MIT) and cultured (she is reading Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"", hence the name of the ape... Oh, come on screenwriters, you could have done better!!), -the cold scientist (complete with goatee, as a hint that he's not a good guy), played by the great Brian Cox, alas!... -the bad corporation executive (why an Afro-American, guys??) -the very very bad zoo-keeper (complete with his usual companion, the retarded zoo-keeper)... Need I say more? Better let's not talk about the apes (the one-eyed bad ape, the brute gorilla with good heart, the suave and wise orangutan...): they don't even rise -no pun intended- to the category of character... they're just BAD animation!! And, finally, talking about animation: I thought if I wasn't to see a good narration, at least I was about to witness the usual ""state-of-the-art"" CGI show-off... And a show-off it was, sure... but in the wrong way. I mean: all that unjustified jumping around of Caesar... what's the point?? But let me tell you something else: if ""Spider-man"" was criticized regarding the unnatural movements of the CGI character 10 years ago, we are in the same point here. You can be very precise with the hair of the animals and the general depiction of the skin, eyes, gestures, etc (Andy Serkis: some day he'll get even the Oscar, I'm afraid). But the more wide and complex movements (jumping, running, fighting...) still are unnatural, unreal. Somehow the animators couldn't see the forest for the trees and the apes in them. Summing it all up: IF YOU SAW THE TRAILER, YOU SAW THE PICTURE, and saved money and time.",2011
5,"First, it's not a bad movie, but neither is it a great movie, which what the 8 average (as offered up by IMDb users) have given it.

10,"Planet of the Apes is a classic film that a lot of people at least know about if they haven't seen it, you know the lines and certain scenes. It was a terrific sci-fi movie that made a break through for twist endings. Tim Burton remade the movie with Mark Wahlberg and it was just horrible, you would think that it was the closing chapter in the Planet of the Apes series. But then Rise of the Planet of the Apes came along and when I saw the trailer, I was just like ""here we go again"". Thinking that it was going to be a horrible movie and that they just wouldn't let the series rest in peace. But instead I have to say that I was one hundred percent wrong, I watched this movie last night and was just totally blown away. It's a prequel not trying to up the original by any means and the special effects are actually done very well. Not only that but the actors are all great who bring a lot of character to the film and gave us a reason to almost vote for the apes to take over the planet.",2012

I won't ruin it for you because there is nothing to ruin. Save your $1.00. Truly pathetic and not even worth writing a long review. Where are all the story tellers???? This wasn't a story at all, just a bunch of dis-jointed scenes that don't make any sense at all. Geesh, really? A bad actor, a bad actress, CGI monkey's do not a movie make. Was there really a script for this movie? Did the actors in this movie actually read it and say ""wow, this is ground-breaking""?? I think not. Wheww........ I'm speechless and will rent the original over and over before I will ever watch this piece of pablum ever again.",2012

1,"is this what movies are going to be now. Big CGI effects shows where they don't bother with plots or anything? I guess what made me angry about this film is that it was premised on what happens when the Mark Wallburg character gets back from the Tim Burton abortion and he finds Earth run by the apes now. So there's this virus that makes apes smart and kills humans, and apparently the CDC and its counterparts in the rest of the world became completely inept in containing it.",2011
1,"I miss the old days -- when movies didn't have to rely so heavily on CGI and, instead, the screenwriters actually cared about things like character development. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" doesn't have anything going for it -- not artistically, and certainly nothing creatively. And it doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's just more by-the-numbers slop tailor-made for teenagers and children. Nothing original about this movie, nothing new. If anything, it's a terrible insult and a mockery to the original franchise.",2014

The redemption is her hooking up with an angry gym teacher when he proves the affluent guy she's sharking for is a shallow imbecile.",2011
7,"Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn't be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. ",2011
8,"Let's face it, the reason many people call Bad Teacher the ""worst movie ever shot"" is not rational, it doesn't have to do with the movie itself in any way. From the reviews I have read on here the main problem seems to be the moral values in this film leading many ""oh so shocked"" viewers to give bad reviews, question people's sanity for producing this movie and hate everything about it - whether they admit it's the reason they dislike it or pretend to hate everything about an objectively well crafted film. But this movie is not supposed to teach anyone life lessons, it's not supposed to have some big, moral message about how to live your life in a good way. This is a film for adults. And films for adults do not have to follow certain morals because an adult is expected to judge morals on their own without needing guidelines. An adult can enjoy movies with main characters doing things they would never find acceptable because it's not about agreeing with the character's actions.",2011
7,"Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.",2011
1,"I know others will disagree with me, but this has got to be in the running for the pick for the Razzies this year. What a pathetic piece of crap. The storyline was boring and the jokes either over-the-top, or, worst, not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays, but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah, Diaz is still a hot body and all, but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers; it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could.",2011
1,What was the point of this movie? Cameron Diaz has been in some great stuff. Why would she humiliate herself with this pathetic script? Perhaps she liked the idea of showing off her body for an hour and a half. Because she is exceptionally hammy here in that respect. ,2011

7,"First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fiancé to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.",2011
1,"Another comic ""gem"" to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, ""Bad Teacher"" is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry. Now it's just part of mainstream ""comedy,"" right there alongside other immortal classics like ""Super Bad,"" ""Jack Ass,"" ""Kick Ass,"" etc.",2011

1,"Deserving of a negative star score, this isn't even a good BAD movie. At least a bad movie can be entertaining, like ""Plan 9 from outer space"" for instance. This movie isn't a comedy at all, its a horror movie. The only reason I made it all the way through was to see the Cameron Diez character get her just deserts. But alas, she never did, how disappointing. I agree with the other sane reviewers in that this is a statement of everything wrong with the world today. How can any normal human being see anything funny about this disaster. Bad teacher indeed, a soulless, conniving, lazy, sleazy self serving bitch. Here's a women whose only ambition in life is to get a big set of fake knockers and to score a rich man at any cost. She spares no ones feelings to get what she wants. The premise is that cheating, lying, and stealing are OK as long as you get what you want. Winners lose and losers win and be damned with normality. Here's the same basic plot line: Cold blooded killer kidnaps, torture's, rapes and then murders indiscriminately any man, women or child he runs into. Then successfully shifts blame to an innocent party who is put to death and then ends with the murderer being put in charge of the bureau of missing persons. Absolute crap is being generous as a rating. The Razzies wouldn't lower themselves to nominating this piece of garbage. Run away from this dog, it will be the biggest waste of time you will ever experience.",2012

2,"Cameron Diaz is terrific but here she's wasted in a terribly lazy script that resorts to farting to get a laugh. She has the only redeemable moment, washing a car! But the whole thing moves from lame sketch to lame sketch. The film had a 31 million opening week-end so I fear we'll have a Bad Teacher 2, how sad, really. Justin Timberlake, who has shown the chops of a very good actor, here he just appears. Jason Segel, what I can I say, I don't get him. The filmmakers should study the films of Preston Sturges and attempt a comedy, even with he same premise, but with originality and wit. The title reminded me of ""Bad Santa"" an hoped for something as smartly irreverent but not such luck. Bad Santa was so much better.",2011
5,"There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally).

Also very good is the supporting cast particularly Lucy Punch as the relentlessly perky but somewhat creepy rival teacher Amy Squirrel. It would be intriguing to see a sequel featuring Amy bringing her own 'brand of zany energy to the disadvantaged students of Malcolm X High'.

He projects the intensity and savvy that makes his character interesting and unique. And this is not hyperbole. Mr. McConaughey's performance is energetic, engaging and entertaining. He manages to project street-smarts and style; he is smart but not slick; he's realistic but not cynical; he is sensitive but not mushy. Another surprise is Ryan Phillippe's excellent performance which also adds considerably to the movie's entertainment value as his character spars with Mr. McConaughey's. Although the story itself is a variation of the detective-who-done-it genre, the effective manner in which the story unfolds coupled with the excellent acting makes this story well-worth watching.",2011

But as he represents him starts to question the good in what he is doing and the morals of his actions. This is one of McConaughey's finest roles in a long time but is nothing compared to William H.

And when Mick goes to see the man he had represented that was convicted of the other prostitute's murder and shows him a picture of Roulet, who was the actual killer, the guy just freaks out! What was that? If he recognized the guy that could be his ticket out of jail but instead he just declares the interview over.

Now, you could even say that if Matthew M. is acting, the movie must be at least decent. And that's exactly what The Lincoln Lawyer is.

In my opinion lawyers do their job for the greater good and as some of them may be greedy and corrupt, most of them do want what is best for their clients. Now, I have no idea why this movie is called The Lincoln Lawyer. Matthew McConaughey plays one of these layers and in the beginning he seems like a crooked lawyer who cheats the system so it seemed like he was going to be a bad guy but a firm twist right in the middle of the movie changes the story of the movie completely.

6,"Terrible title for an okay movie. My dad's a fan of Michael Connelly's crime fiction so I was mildly intrigued to watch it and while it was very reminiscent of your average John Grisham, it was watchable with the requisite triple-twist tacked on at the end to keep you interested. Yes, it's quite stylised, as you'd expect from a film set amongst the glitterati of California, nothing and nobody seems real so that you feel you're watching the pilot of some new TV series, which I'd probably say would work quite well on the small screen. There's not much action but plenty of plot, typical of the adaptation of a source thriller novel like this.",2012
5,"McConaughey, who is maturely handsome and sly, seems slow and overblown as the lawyer Mick Hiller in this film, and Marisa Tomei is simply not believable as the ex-wife prosecutor. William H. Macy, as Hiller's investigator, steals whatever show there is. (The defendant, whose name I cannot even remember is, well, forgettable.) This story, which involves themes like a lawyer's obligations to his criminal client, has been far better portrayed, not to mention acted, by the main character and those around him/her, in films like ""Primal Fear"" (Richard Gere), ""Jagged Edge"" (Glen Close), ""Devil's Advocate"" (Keannu Reeves) and of course ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (Charles Laughton), to name a few. If you want to see McConaughey as a lawyer, see ""A Time to Kill,"" a much better movie and he is excellent and better drawn in it.",2011
8,"The film begins with several instances of McConaughey's character Mick engaging in dishonesty for his own benefit. So it should not be surprising that Mick violates countless ethical rules and probably some criminal laws on his way to the climax of the film. The film's point of view about the justice system is extremely cynical: the detectives don't hesitate to invent evidence and cut corners to convict someone they believe is guilty, and the plot matches this dishonesty with Mick on his way to seeing that the guilty are convicted. The point of criminal justice is that the jury should decide, and not the investigators or attorneys.",2011

9,"Martin Scorsese's HUGO is a family movie that will probably only cater to a niche crowd: people who appreciate movies as art (e.g. cinema snobs, though I use the term endearingly). I'm not saying it won't appeal to the general masses. It's still an interesting story, wonderfully acted, and packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. But let's face it: this isn't your average movie, it's a love letter. Scorsese has been a vocal supporter of restoring old movies in hopes they'll be saved from oblivion (rightfully so) and this movie, based on a children's book by Brian Selznick, is his method of beautifully pleading his case before millions of people who've probably refuse to watch black and white movies on the basis that they're, you know, black and white (yes, I know those sorts of people). HUGO is a film meant to bring out attention to the movies long-forgotten and remind us of the magic behind them, told through the adventure of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Hugo is an orphan whose father died in a museum fire, and he lives behind the walls of a Parisian train station. When he's not busy with his job of keeping the station clocks ticking, Hugo spends his time repairing an old automaton his father rescued from museum storage. An encounter with a curmudgeonly toy store owner and his granddaughter Isabelle will send Hugo on a journey to repair the automaton and discover its long-hidden secrets.",2012

Strangely, it took a French film maker, Michel Hazanavicius, to release a movie that pays homage to early, silent American cinema (The Artist). Conversely, Martin Scorsese, a well-known cinephile, delights with his love of early European silent cinema, in his often beautiful 'children's' film, Hugo.",2012
9,"Like many, I suspect, I went into this film ready to be dazzled by the cinematography and a rare, nice clean story by Director Martin Scorcese. I wasn't disappointed although I found the story lagging in a few brief spots. Cutting the film another 10 minutes might have solved that. Having said that, though, a month later I'm all ready to view it again! ",2012
7,"I watched this movie without any expectations and with an open mind. I thought it started off kind of slow but once you realise what the story is about, you really enjoy it.

8,"Last December I saw 'Hugo' with my friend and it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The set design is fantastic, the special effects are unbelievable, the relationships between the characters are lovable. But most of all that's special about this masterpiece is the brand new pure 3D. This film is the next step up to 3D. Cinematographer Robert Richardson did some perfectly good shots where the 3D would stand out. It really feels like your actually inside Hugo's adventure. Loads of stuff come towards you. It's actually the best 3D film I've ever seen. I thought the effect was better than Cameron's 'Avatar' and should've been shot also with Imax 3D cameras as well. Scorsese has the soul of master storytelling. An artist that's switched from violence to magic. A love poem for the magic of cinema. It brings back long-time true stories and old film clips that could've been lost. A Parisian orphan boy, a mechanical man and a bookworm girl who've been wrapped up into a mystery from his late father. The main people that worked so hard on this film are mostly Martin Scorsese, Graham King, John Logan, Robert Richardson, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and mostly the author that wrote and all of this into one book, Brian Selznick who's got an enchanted mind of clocks, mechanical men, 1930's, mystery and magical twists. By the time you've finished watching you'll be able to have the true feeling of cinema.",2012

8,"Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan in Paris around 1930. His father (Jude Law) died in a tragic accident and several weeks ago, the lad's rather good-for-nothing uncle passed, too. Wanting to keep the news of his ""home alone"" status a secret, especially from a train station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), Hugo continues winding the large station clock, something his uncle was hired to do. Naturally, the young boy has resorted to being a pickpocket and a fruit snatcher to survive. Gifted mechanically, Hugo steals tools from a toy shop owner, Georges (Ben Kingsley) and, one day, is caught with a five finger discount. Very upset, the grouchy toyman takes away Hugo's prized notebook, a gift from his late dad. Terribly distraught, Hugo makes several attempts to reason with the old man. Fortunately, M. Georges has a ward, a girl named Isabelle, who is about Hugo's age. She wants to help Hugo in his endeavors. Well and good, thinks Hugo. But, M. Georges has many secrets, and the closer the young pair get to them, the angrier the toyshop owner becomes. He is even somehow connected to an automaton which Hugo's father was trying to restore. Also, although the Inspector has caught the admiration of a pretty flower seller (Emily Mortimer), he continues to haul young orphans off to institutions. What are the secrets of M. Georges? Will Hugo uncover them before he is caught in the inspector's net? First, this quite a beautiful film and such a change from Scorsese's last brilliant effort, Shutter Island. Although I was not fortunate enough to view the movie in 3-D, the scenery is breathtaking and the camera shots are equally so. Also, the cast is remarkable, with Kingsley, Butterfield, Mortimer, and particularly Cohen, enlivening the happenings. The story is also strong, especially its eventual glimpse into the world of silent cinema. Therefore, the film's weaknesses are its slow pace and far-from-sharp editing. Yes, Scorsese probably found it difficult to ""slice away"" beautiful images, but the flick would have benefited if he had. But, by no means should you skip Hugo. Its riches can be enjoyed by the entire family and everyone will bask in the bountiful imagery that is indeed, head turning.",2013

It's been a while since I've seen a film that spoke to me as personally as this film did. I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese and he's crafted a beautiful ode to not only cinema but also imagination and in a way, it celebrates all the things that help us escape. The world is a scary place and everyone goes through pain and suffering but if you just try and learn to dream, find your voice and not be afraid then you would be surprised what could happen.",2011

Absolutely knock-out use of 3D, fantastic performances by everyone involved, glorious set design, music, costumes and state -of-the-art CGI that propel a story rather than being superficial, stand alone tricks makes HUGO a film for moviegoers world wide.

1,"A movie about the silent film industry with an automaton set in a train  station? Sounds good doesn't it. This was a movie with potential, but  it fell short so much so that I'm not going to waste my time giving it  a detailed, complete critique. So here's the bullet points: The  transitions were horrendous. The scenes jumped so much that half the  time i didn't know where the characters were or where they were going.  The boy who played Hugo was terrible. He was hired for his blue-sad eye  stare. That was it, no range of emotion past the stare.  The Station Inspector was a strange character. When you make an injured  war veteran the comic relief (not in a heartwarming way, but a feels  awkward to laugh at his injury sort of way) there's something wrong.  Pitiable and sad to hear others in the theater laugh at him.  The dialog was vapid and moronic. ""Everything has a purpose in life...  even machines"". Well ya, machines have a purpose otherwise we wouldn't  bother having them!! I could bury myself with all the plot holes in  this movie. Nuf said.  Overall no heart to the story.

This is the same man who gave us ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" Every detail enriches our experience. Dante Ferreti's production design is, monumental, costumes, photography and Howard Shore's score are, quite simply, breath taking. I'm running out of superlatives and I haven't yet mentioned Sacha Baron Cohen, priceless.

The guy who thought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead. Real Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a long time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath. Great movie.",2011
5,"What a little gem Real Steel could have been. Well before its release, and before any intricate plot details became known, this sounded like an intelligent film in which robots are forced to engage in brutal fights for the entertainment of their human masters. Where the story would've gone from there is left to the imagination, but it appeared to have all the makings of critically acclaimed, self-conscious science fiction. The final product differed heavily from initial expectations, however, and we are left with a hollow, albeit bearable alternative prompting those such as myself to ask: What could have been?",2011
1,"This movie starts out well enough, hugh jackmann at his best: quietly driving a truck along a dusty road. his character, Charlie, is the cliché boxing, two-timing douche-bag roadrunner type, in this case set in a futuristic time (although the only futuristic pieces in the movie are robots and cellphones, and a truck that for some reason has windows where the driver's feet are), where robots do the boxing for you. Charlie is trying to win fights with the robots he buys or puts together from scraps, but does not demonstrate any skill, interest or dedication. He gets distracted and has no heart for the machines he uses. When he gets the news that his ex-girlfriend dies, he shows no emotional reaction, except for trying to swindle her rich sister for the custody of their only son, which he agrees to take on for a summer in order to receive a paycheck. The rest we can predict from here, and does not deviate from our most boring projections. ",2011

8,"Based on what everybody said, Real Steal is like Over The Top plus Rocky with Robots. Over The Top because there's a man, his son, and a truck. Rocky because it's obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it's excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It's also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.",2011

1,"When this film was first announced about a year ago, I immediately added to my film schedule months in advance: It had a cool name and hey, it was a movie with robots and the always hot Hugh Jackman! Then the trailer came out, and the story was revealed to be touching family film about a dad and his estranged son with robots thrown in. A sweet family film? Ugh. I immediately took it off my viewing schedule. Then the reviews came out, and even Entertainment Weekly gave it an excellent review, saying that it is actually way better than you would expect. Pair that with big box office, and my curiosity started to come around again. Finally, it got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects, and thus, I no longer had a choice.",2012
1,"I don't know what Hollywood producers are thinking any more... Or maybe I do: cast a kid that looks like Justin Bieber, and focus the whole movie on his constant whining, screaming, yelling and in general acting like a spoiled brat, because apparently it sells! Lines that will keep ringing in your ears for a few hours after the viewing (in pre-puberty whiny childish voice): ""Do something!!"", ""Why are you not fighting back!!!"", ""I don't like hamburgers!"". And let's not forget forced touching moments with the appropriate music, tears in their eyes and the family re-uniting just because some robots are punching at each other. Was this movie made by Disney? I don't know or care, but please don't give your money to watch it.",2011
9,"""Real Steel"" is awesome. I did not expect this going in. It is more than just ""Transformers"" meets ""Rocky"" doing ""rock-um sock-um robots"". I saw Hugh Jackman on Jimmy Fallon talk about what made him enroll in the project. ""Real Steel"" beyond the visually astounding CGI glitz and spectacle is the touching story of father and son defining love and respect. Again, not all that surprising given Steven Spielberg is Executive Producer. I'm a fan of Jackman. ""Real Steel"" may be his crossover hit that leverages his amazing gifts, playing a real guy, and not a superhero. He is awesome, as well. As Jackman describes ""Real Steel"" is about second chances, and redemption. Sure the story's climax pits underdog undersized fighting robot Atom against the ferocious indestructible Zeus. For me, ""Real Steel"" resonates in its human voice. Hugh Jackman as Charlie confesses to his son Max (scene stealing Dakota Goyo), ""You deserve better than me."" Charlie asks Max, what he wants from him. Max answers, ""I want you to fight for me!"" Yes, ""Real Steel"" is fighting for love with everything you have. ""Real Steel"" is the real deal.",2011

9,"The word flook has suddenly developed a new meaning altogether for me when I accidentally bought tickets to this movie as no other show was available. Barely did I know that I would end up seeing a magnum opus, a perfect cross over movie transcending from modern day fiction to a timeless classic. There are very few movies made which can cater to the likes of each individual movie goer, but then there are the occasional ones like ""real steel"" that qualify for such prizes. Its a brilliant plot, yet not sketchy and achy as the transformers, not too much into the future to rattle your brains. Its a perfect blend of all sort of emotions while giving the cinema goer the daily dose of excitement. Good acting by the leads, Butler is very impressive, watch out for the kid.. Good narration, excellent script, effects are super and state of the art direction. Need I say more",2011

You're supposed to fall for the kid who's father is a screw-up but it's hard to feel sorry for a manipulative kid who's no better than his own father. Some have suggested that this is ""Rocky"" on steroids but the script is anemic at best. The closest you'll get to an emotional connection is to the girlfriend running the gym. At least she knows where she stands! For the rest of the cast, it's like lost sheep. Baah! Seriously, this movie, despite the hype, is one you should take a pass on. There are a lot of much better actions movies out there. If you're into a retro vibe then pick up some James Bond on Blueray, sure to appeal to both men and women. Any of the Jason Bourne (Idnetity, Supremacy, Ultimatum) videos are far better than this piece of tripe. Then again, your mileage may vary.",2012
4,"""Real Steel"" starring Hugh Jackman and directed by Shawn Levy is an awful clichéd bunch of trite. It reaches into the dozen or so boxing movies in a grab bag of hackneyed and rip-off situations from much better movies. It tries to be original by throwing in robots as the boxers, but ultimately the outcome is more like a bad video game movie. The one where the story gets washed away by unintelligent and patronizing dialog. Hugh Jackman instills some needed energy, and the sci-fi concept has some merit, but the PG script and storyline is steaming turd. An ""R"" rating, adult script, and tossing out the whole father/son mush would've sharpened the movie some. The music is gawd-awful and brainless with a mix or rock, rap, and cheesy dramatic interludes from a soap-opera, and the romance is perfunctory. Overall bad - not recommended",2012

Some great scenes involving crude/sexual/racial humor that catch you off guard and have you rolling. The plot is a little forced, as was the ending, which is partially forgivable in the case of a comedy, as long as it makes you laugh. Seeing Kevin Spacey play asshole boss brought back fond memories (Swimming With Sharks), he pulls it off very well. Jennifer Aniston very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome. Charlie Day was amazing, and resembles his character in always Sunny in Philly (personal fav). Overall, not quite for the collection, but definitely worthwhile a trip to the movie theater!",2011
9,"Murder. Car chases. Scandal. Rape. Conspiracy. Blackmail. Revenge. These are usually the key words to a suspenseful drama, but in this case are applied to a dark comedy that is relentless, chaotic, and just as funny as advertised. Horrible Bosses is the type of movie that would make Danny DeVito proud, as it blends a fun plot full of fun twists with standout comedic performances, plenty of surprises, and the inability to ever become predictable. Unlike most recent R-rated comedies, this film is raunchy without truly crossing the line, profane without becoming redundant and outrageous without becoming tedious. Don't look now but this movie is legitimately funny, and among the better comedies released in quite some time.",2011

In fact, when I first say Bobby, it took me a moment and another scene with Bobby for me to realize that it was Colin! I read that Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughy, and Ashton Kutcher were all considered for this movie and I am so glad that they weren't part of this movie. All of the actors in this film were perfect for this movie and the acting was superb! This is a movie that should be watched for the entertainment factor and when you just need a great laugh. Plus, who can't relate to having a horrible boss and dream of getting rid of them? If you enjoyed this movie with Jason Bateman, then I recommend that you watch The Switch, which he also stars in and is another greatly entertaining movie.",2013

I gotta say, I would've been better off letting my friend just in the theater while I spent my 98 minutes peacefully reading a book at Barnes and Nobles. This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen! Let's start with the plot: three guys hate their bosses so the best thing to do is quit/find another job? No. Report their bosses? No. Ah that's right: let's murder them. The three main characters were annoying and over-the-top. They were too stupid to actually be believable. The dialogue was just an endless stream off curse words, sex jokes, and dirty humor which is typical in ""comedies"" these days. Last time I checked, comedies were supposed to be oh I don't know funny! The movie also had no ""heart"". The writers wanted this movie to be simply another dirty, raunchy comedy with absolutely no substance! The writers could've given the ""evil bosses"" a reason for the way they acted. It could've been a movie about understand different points-of-views and people's experiences but no...it was simply a movie about three guys who want to commit first-degree murder because they don't their bosses.

How can this series be called Transformers if it doesn't have enough Transformers? The Autobots only appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes about them.

What is the point of having a chick running around in these types of movies? Really, is it necessary to have some chick in skimpy clothes romancing around with metal crashing on metal in the background ? Unless off-course you wanted to woo schoolgirls in to watch the movie.

What remains is the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads. Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone into overdrive, and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less relatable and interesting. His home life in particular (of which the first half of the movie focuses) is getting irritating. His girlfriend problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn't care that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice.

When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of well less than household names.

This is until he meets Pete Brand, played by Jonah Hill, an economic major from Yale. Brand devises a formula that analyzes players in a way nobody else does, thus revealing statistics about players that no one else can see. Beane and Brand use this formula to build up their unlikely roster of misfits. The themes of this film run deep through our aspiring minds. It's a film about beating the odds, going against the current, and standing up for what you believe is right. It is a moving and inspiring film that really only uses baseball as a backdrop for its deeper and more universal themes. It's a moving film and you don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.",2011

It really caught me by surprise since I'm not a big baseball fan and wasn't expecting much considering the subject matter. Baseball and economics seemed like a bad combination for me, but since Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were all starring in this film I had to see it. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Billy Beane character and the relationship he had with his young assistant Peter Brand. They are really the center of this movie so if you're doubting wither or not you should see this worrying about the subject matter all I can say is go see it anyways because it is much more than simply another baseball movie. There are some very strong and emotional scenes where I couldn't help but get goose bumps over a team and a sport I really didn't care for. That is how good this film is. Moneyball is directed by Bennett Miller, who also directed Capote in which Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his lead performance as Truman Capote. Miller has proved he can make some great films. The movie was adapted from the book written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) which focuses on the true story of the Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane, who managed to put together the 2002 team on a very low budget by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players based on a formula which was perfected by his young assistant. This would change the game forever. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network and Charlie Wilson's War) did a great job at adapting the screenplay for the big screen.",2012
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. While reading ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, I never once considered what it might look like as a movie. And I am the kind of guy who looks at a mailbox and wonders if a movie about a mailman might be interesting (Costner proved me wrong). If you are a baseball fan, you should see this movie. If you are not a baseball fan, the movie works very well as a metaphor for any business maverick who takes a risk and analyzes their company or industry from an entirely new perspective. The game of baseball was over a hundred years old when Oakland A's GM Billy Beane turned the institution on its ear.",2011
2,"Michael Lewis' book, Moneyball, ranks among the best sports book of all time. After the success of The Blindside, this superior Lewis book seemed prime for a film as fantastic as the Sandra Bullock driven movie. Unfortunately, the film adaptation is the worst baseball movie since Major League and The Sandlot spawned sequels. ",2011
1,If you know anything about baseball or care anything about baseball then this movie is a huge disgrace.,2012
4,"There was nothing engaging about this movie. The characters were bland. The cinematography was nothing to marvel over. I understand that real life isn't always as engaging as we'd like it to be, but it worked for the Blind Side. I fail to understand why these directors couldn't make it work.",2011
5,"Moneyball is a slow moving chamber room film about the administrative and strategic aspects of baseball. Does it sound dry to you? Then you'll probably think it is. It's very down to earth, almost minimalistic in a sense, just lacking the emotional strength. Nothing is exaggerated, all the scenes are like normal everyday conversations.",2012
6,"So last year it seemed like one of the most talked about movies was Moneyball, everyone has been screaming about Brad Pitt's performance, so I was more than enthused to rent this film. I'm also a baseball fan, it's my favorite sport, so I thought I would naturally connect to this film as well as my fiancé who just a sports fanatic in general. Baseball is a tricky sport though, some consider it very boring and some consider it thrilling. So I was thinking that people would hated baseball would not get into this film, but over all the reviews have been more than positive. I actually think this was a good film, however for the first time in my baseball life, I found it kind of dull. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good movie, but I don't find the story that fascinating. I know that it's a story that was about the way we changed how we look at athletes when recruiting for teams, however the film can drag out a bit and doesn't get really good until the ending.",2012
5,"Every year there has to be one BIG award winning film that I just shake my head about and wonder what the hell everyone is thinking? Slumdog Millionaire was WAY over hyped, American Beauty, Babel, every George Clooney movie...I could go on. But Moneyball is the exact definition of me shaking my head. I thought Moneyball was downright boring. Yes the performances were solid but the content of the movie, and the scenes were simply boring. The film was about two hours too long and nothing of any significance ever happens. I am just constantly surprised by people's comments on this film and I don't just mean professional critics. IMDb reviewers are saying...Best Film of 2011, ""Incredible"", Brad Pitt's best role...surely some sort of mass hypnosis has been done because this movie was not even average. It was boring, contrived, with zero climax and had more to do with money than baseball.",2012
5,"Sometimes you hear about a movie and you say, well, that doesn't sound at all interesting, but so many people say it's great that you watch it anyways. That's what happened in the case of Moneyball, a movie that combines two things I have little interest in: sports and statistics.",2012
4,Moneyball is about finding and then exploiting market deficiencies and it is applicable to any business not just baseball. This book was key to changing the way a walk was valued and it started a new era of baseball thinking which eventually evolved into a hybrid of numbers and scouting. They choose not to focus on this and instead made a super melodramatic story on what Billy Beane went through. Am I suppose to think that a guy who outperformed his expectancy the past few years is now in trouble of getting fired because of one bad start to a season? This is just a example of the over-dramatic feel that this movie has created for itself. A twelve year old daughter overly concerned about her fathers job security when she herself is singing songs about being so alone in the world is another example.,2011
6,"Clocking in at 2 hours, 13 minutes, ""Moneyball"" requires a commitment. Beyond time, an interest - or at least a lack of aversion - to mathematical concepts and, obviously, baseball also will aid in the enjoyment of this biopic. While athletic Brad Pitt does a reasonable impression of athletic former ballplayer Billy Beane, the true star is author Michael Lewis. Lewis is contemporary literature's foremost writer on men, money and the risks the one takes with the other. His ability to illuminate the arcane economic theories the character of Peter Brand (the Oscar-nominated Jonah Hill) brings to bear on baseball player selection gives the book and the movie real heft. Hill likely does not deserve the Oscar nod for player a fairly uni-dimensional statistician who is not taxed to demonstrate any real emotion (unless awkward is an emotion). At least the wildly miscast Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't get one for the cerebral actor's misguided attempt at portraying put-upon Oakland A's manager Art Howe. Beyond these three men the other characters are largely forgettable former (mostly) baseball players. In short, if you like baseball or numbers the film is a must-see but otherwise you'll find it overlong and lacking true dramatic engagement.",2012
2,I'm starting to think Mr.Pitt doesn't know what to do with his hands when he's acting. But now he is rarely seen far from finger food. Initially I thought it was a character trait he'd invented for whoever he played in the Ocean's 11 series[ whenever we cut to him he usually was finishing some snack or other...hilarious!] But it seems that it's going to be a regular part of his performance cannon.,2011
6,Introducing a new mega-star: Jessica Brown Findlay. Some films are destined to remain in the shadows of the stars they create. Albatross is one of those films.,2011
8,"Now and again a quiet little British movie pops up to remind us just how well the Brits know how to mix comedy and compassion. Such is the case with ALBATROSS, a gentle, sensitive tale written by Tazmin Rafn and directed by Niall MacCormick about a social misfit who imposes herself on a family in desperate need of a wakeup call. The film is blessed with a very fine cast (especially the blossoming of young actress Jessica Brown Findlay - remembered for her ongoing impressive role as Lady Sybil in 'Downton Abbey') and for the breathtaking scenery of the Isle of Man. There is comedy here to be sure but here are other lessons about family and friendship and relationships that are importantly placed in perspective.",2012
10,"I watched this film without any expectations, in the end, I got exactly what I wanted. Albatross might not be a masterpiece but it certainly has become one of my favorites. I wonder why Comedy isn't added in this film's genre 'cause I found most of the dialogues comical.",2013
9,"A fabulous pastry pleases all your senses and leaves you with a bit of chocolate on your lip and wanting more. I gorged on this one. But there's more to be said for this movie. It takes a clever but easily clichéd story line and spins it out so freshly creative it makes your face hurt from smiling. And all the moguls with the money should line up to honor Jessica Brown-Findlay who took a cleverly written part and turned it into an award winning performance. But I must be honest and say that the TR-2 might have influenced me. When I was 16, I lusted for a bright red version on the showroom floor in upstate New York. How much better can you make a movie for a 71 year old incurable romantic who can still remember what lust is all about.",2012
7,"Jessica Findlay Brown, who is starting to make a name for herself by shining in Downton Abbey is a truly sensational young actress who people should certainly keep an eye on, give it a few years and she'll be everywhere I suspect. Albatross is a film which kind of reminded me of another British film of late, Tamara Drewe, the plot line of both ate very similar, but this film has a great drama and family aspect to it also, that's not to say it's not funny either because it is. The film starts off somewhat confusing, you don't know where it's headed but it's not long til you get the hang of the direction and you just enjoy the ride, the story is about a social misfit who imposes herself on a family in desperate need of a kick start, she befriends the teenage daughter, wonderfully played by the luminous Felicity Jones, starts a brief affair with the father and comes head to head with the high strung mother. The affair plot line is what reminds me of Tamara Drewe, this is the plot line I found the least interesting but hey the movie has so many great scenes it's hard not to enjoy.",2012
7,"This film depicts a dysfunctional family owning a Bed and Breakfast house in a coastal British town. The father wrote a wildly successful novel many years ago, and the family lives off his early success. He has had writer's block for quite some time since. ",2012
7,"There are some characters in this film, there really are, and they are all so very different, and, at the same time, very alike. Emilia, at times quite brilliantly played by Jessica Brown Findlay, is the superficially confident teen who commands the scene and will not be put down easily. Beth, well played by Felicity Jones, is the girl who likes the rebel instinct of Emilia, but is waiting on a place at Oxford. The two girls, and their families, live in a fictitious English south coast town. Beth's parents own a hotel/guest house proceeds from the only book her father has successfully authored. There is much friction between Beth's parents.",2012
10,"..I just wanted to jump on the Jessica Brown-Findlay bandwagon here as her performance was beyond amazing...it's not often you are able to witness that special moment when you just know that the young actress you are watching is most certainly destined to become a major star...such is the case with Jessica Brown-Findlay in Albatross...not only does she steal the film and every scene in which she appears, she complete enchants and beguiles you with her charm,wit,charisma and screen presence. Her power is such that without her, this would have been a typical coming of age story of young girl/woman....she single-handedly captures your undivided attention, inspires your romantic fascination with youth, beauty, and a vitality & passion for living life to the fullest...I challenge any male from 18 to 80 not to fall at least a little in love with her...must see!",2013

6,"Emelia Conan Doyle (Jessica Brown Findlay) claims to be a descendant of the great writer Arthur Conan Doyle. She takes a cleaning job at a seaside hotel owned by Jonathan Fischer (Sebastian Koch). He's struggling with writer's block and holed up in the attic. He has combative wife Joa (Julia Ormond), bookish daughter Beth (Felicity Jones), and six year old Posy. Emelia befriends Beth who is applying for Oxford. Emelia claims to be a writer but she can't live up to her family name. As Jonathan mentors her, they begin an affair.",2016
3,"'Albatross' tells the story of a dysfunctional family (living in the Isle of Man) and all the cliches are on display: louche, middle-aged writer as a father; sympathetic, intelligent daughter; troubled, troublesome and sexy daughter's best friend; younger child with the knack of saying inappropriate things; mother-turned-harridan by the stresses of keepinng them all together. The soundtrack is obvious and plodding, too, and while the gorgeous Manx landscape is attractively filmed, I'm a bit baffled by the fact that characters apparently leave the island not by ferry or air, but by road. The ending is also bizarre, the ""best friend"" has supposedly wanted to be a writer, but having done nothing to encourage us to take that ambition seriously, the film suddenly asks it to serve as the crux of the its dramatic climax. Sadly, I've seen more offensive and incompetant movies, I've seen few with less orginality.",2018
7,Inertness is graceful. Behaviour is weirdness. Inertness is a switch. Behaviour is a switch. ,2017
9,"The story centers round the lives of the two girls Emelia played by Jessica Brown Finlay and Beth played by Felicity Jones both extremely beautiful girls, Jessica bears striking similarity to both Megan Fox and Rachel McAdams. Emelia is a girl whose live is filled with bittersweet moments she works in The Cliff House the B&B owned by Beth's parents as a cleaner while living with her grandparents and her grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's. Emelia has a daring and fun approach to life while being sarcastically funny on the way. However she finds comfort in the fact that she believes she is related to the author Conan-Doyle who wrote Sherlock which she mentions on numerous occasions. She goes on to have an affair with Beth's father the struggling writer which makes you feel is due to her lack of a father figure in her life. This part is very well played by Jessica Brown Findlay who is not only beautiful but a talented actress. What really struck me was the scene in which Emelia questions her Grandfather played by the wonderful Peter Vaughan about if her surname is really Conan-Doyle the emotion is very moving to say the least and its a pivotal scene in the film where Emelia starts anew and becomes happy in her life, that everythings going to be OK.",2011
8,"It is hardly surprising that I repeat sentiments expressed in previous comments about the arrival of a great new British talent, I refer, of course, to Jessica Brown Findlay. In what would have otherwise been an unremarkable coming-of-age movie Findlay( 'Emelia') manages to transform the mundane. This lady's love affair with the camera and her audience was so complete that I felt sorry for that other rising British starlet, her co-star, Felicity Jones ('Beth'). It reminded me of the way that an emerging Angelina Jolie took over 'Girl Interrupted'much to the chagrin of the film's major star Winona Ryder. Findlay has that indefinable something, call it stage presence, that Jones doesn't. Unfortunately Jones also suffers from the same problem encountered by Sarah Michelle Geller in her mid-20s that of having the face of a perpetual fifteen year old! It would appear that Jones can go on playing schoolgirls into her thirties. Steady employment maybe but not so clever if you want to be accepted as a serious actor. The film has some solid character acting from such stalwarts as Peter Vaughan as Emelia's wise old granddad, Julia Ormand as Beth's embittered mother and Sebastian Koch, as Beth's one-book-wonder father with a midlife crisis. Good writing also, that broadens the characters and gradually enables the viewer to realise that it is not only Emelia who carries an 'albatros' that is stunting her ambition but all those around her are also burdened in some manner that is preventing them from moving on. In endeavouring to lift her burden Emelia alters their lives by the sheer impact of her personality. Interestingly two years elapsed between production and release of this film. One wonders if the studio, realising that the hitherto unknown JBF was becoming a star (Downton Abbey), had decided to rework the film and publicity to reflect her new status. If so I think the studio made the right decision.",2012
10,"By Jupiter's rooster! I'd be willing to wager coin that many a skeptic became a believer upon viewing the premier of ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"". From the opening moment to the final credits I could not gaze in another direction. The brilliant writing combined with outstanding performances and great visuals come together to produce what will no doubt become legend. The depiction of a world with honor among slaves and dishonor among their masters is masterful. The portrayal of a world which doesn't require the web or mass media for it's inhabitants to be exposed to every depravity and brutality known to humanity is enthralling. A better adrenaline rush could only be found by those living in such a world. A must see for connoisseurs of sex and violence. Mere mortals could do worse than vowing patronage to ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"". Never was a more visceral experience produced by a succession of images on an HD screen combined with surround sound!",2011
10,"As all of you probably know this is a prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand. I assume it is such because of Andy Whitfield's ongoing battle with cancer. Although harsh sounding as it may be, during the first episode you barely miss him. This is not because of anything other than the fact that it is a prequel and we all hope he will return for future seasons.",2011
10,"guys nobody is recognizing the role of batiatus.....i see no single comment mentioning about him....it is he who played long duration in all the episodes....and with his performance, has brought life to spartacus TV series...he was the one with highest dialogues in the serial, but he never made us feel bored of his role either in blood and sand or gods of the arena....he really showed us a true lanista......i agree that all the actors performed to their best.Anyways its a great entertainer for our period showing us about the lifestyle during the period of gladiators.I really love the politics in this series especially those played by lucretia and batiatus together in both blood and sand and also gods of the arena.....i really bow before the dialogue writer particularly for the phrase 'jupitor's c**k' during the scenes of frustration..",2011
10,wow. For those who feared this would be a let down without the original lead actor please put such thoughts aside. This prequel seems better than the first season! I'd suggest they have learned some valuable lessons in the first series.,2011
10,"Wow. I absolutely loved the first season of Spartacus and was so sad to hear of Andy getting cancer. I didn't think the show could continue without him. I was proved wrong by the first ten minutes of Gods of the Arena. The actor portraying Gannicus is instantly likable and I actually like him more than Spartacus. Spartacus is mostly melodramatic while Gannicus is just an egotistical cocky bad ass. By the second episode, the writers do such an excellent job that you actually care deeply for these characters and the horrors they face. Episode 3 went almost too far in the portrayal of the brutality of Rome. I just watched episode 4, and am still reeling at the awesomeness. The writing on this show is completely unrivaled, and they do not ever sacrifice reality for taste. The character development and raw emotion in them is so well portrayed through not only excellent writing, but insanely good acting. I will say that especially this season is not for the faint hearted, but if extreme gore, profanity, nudity, and VERY mature themes are not a problem for you then you simply must watch this show!",2011
9,"I enjoyed Blood and Sand, but as a guilty pleasure. Outrageous sex and violence, some truly terrible dialogue and dodgy acting from Kiwi accented muscle men. It was fun, but not gripping nor truly addictive.",2011
7,"I wrote a number of individual episode reviews of Blood & Sand. I was frankly blown away, it was not merely some of the best entertainment I had ever seen, it was in a class by itself, a sort of take-no-prisoners approach to TV drama. (Sorry for the bad pun) I spent time with this second season, packaged as a prequel, because of the excellent reviews.",2015
9,"What's wrong with enjoying in something shallow? This Gods of the Arena is unplanned for and is meant only to bridge till they do the second season, for tragic causes... Only thing annoying enough to take the 10th star is that slaves are speaking deep thoughts in short sentences and wise manner... even more so than their masters! I like the brutality in all the fights, sex and lies! That's probably how ancient societies were, specially Rome. I truly cannot wait to see next season, and this one, however different from the first, is just a way to keep us interested in the series. So, do not be too picky of it's quality. I wanted to keep this review shorter but I could not, since I like to support easy watching series as I find it much more satisfying to ease my mind by watching TV than to watch something of what I will think next two days.",2011
10,"I really don't like violence in movies or series..this show has plenty of it as well as nudity but somehow I enjoy the show.I think cast is well selected.Especially John Hannah is outstanding actor.I couldn't think anybody else in this role.Special effects are not very realistic but action never stops so you don't care about these unrealistic effects.At the final of the each episode, you say don't make this to me ,don't end in here and one week passes with thinking what is the next..second season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be next year.we have to wait too long ..I'm already looking forward to it..Go Gladiators!",2011
10,"In my opinion Spartacus: Gods of the Arena crushes the first season in it's ability to draw me in, and keep me on the edge of my seat anxiously awaiting the next episode. It being a prequel season showing how the dynamics of each individual character came about was a wonderful idea. You get a more in depth look at every character; Asher seems even more devious, you see Batiatus when he's still a vulnerable young man rather than the Lanista on top of the world, and of course seeing Crixus the undefeated Gaul start from nothing. On top of how the season portrayed old characters it also did an AMAZING job in it's induction of new characters. Gannicus quickly became my favorite character in the show. He fights arguably the best, he has this cocky attitude about himself because he knows he's the best and yet he has a down to earth sentimental side that when the words leave his mouth they just stay in my head. He gives many lines I feel people should be living their lives by. My favorite being, ""There are many things given to us in this life for the wrong reasons. What we do with such blessings, that is the true test of a man"". This season although only being 6 episodes, (not even half of it's comparable seasons) has I would estimate an equal amount of surprising twists. Many times a character will go from being the lowest of the low face in the dirt, and by next episode they've stabbed someone in the back or made a deal that gets them to the top. If anyone was on the fence about watching/buying this season I give a whole hearted YES that you should watch it. This season was my favorite of the best show I believe has ever been aired. They wouldn't have even made this season if it wasn't for the original man who played Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They started this season in hopes that it would give time for Andy to get better and hopefully return for the next season. Unfortunately life had different plans and Andy Whitfield died shortly after the season ended. Never forget where it all started, and honor the true Bringer of Rains! R.I.P. Andy Whitfield",2013
10,"What can I say? The acting, directing, screenplay (script) are some of the best I've ever seen. A cast of unknowns that act soo well it makes you feel as if you are really there. I looked up Gladiators on wikipedia and realized that the names, Towns, clothing, and real life stories in this series actually existed... I was shocked that the makers of the series really stuck to the actual events that took place and didn't just ""make things up"". This brings a sense of realism to the show which heightens the drama and the over all story. If you wanted ""Thee"" actual gladiator film or series, then this and ""Blood and Sand"" are ""it"". The era of Rome's gladiators (slaves) from the 1st century (which fought to the death) has never been depicted so well by any other movie or TV series that I have ever seen and i've seen them all. I have seen other comments like ""HBO's Rome was better"". ""Rome"" isn't about gladiators or the view point of the slave's lives. There's really no argument in comparing the two. Twists, turns, politics, loyalty and betrayal are all put to the test in ""Spartacus Gods of the Arena"". This series is ""heavy on sex and violence"" but has an excellent story and 3 dimensional characters everywhere. You will feel compassion for some characters and hate others with a vengeance. When a series can make you feel such emotions then in my opinion it's an absolute winner. Entertainment that's off the charts! ""It just doesn't get any better than this folks""!",2011
8,Spartacus: GotA is a lot more complex than people think it is. I believe that the bigger amount of sex and violence make people not to focus as much as they should in the environment of the series.,2011

10,"Spawned from Spartacus' c**k comes shows like 'Game of Thrones' and the like. But SPARTACUS really raised the bar and kicked the ladder out from under it! This is pure entertainment. The blood/gore/sex/nudity level is cranked up to level '10', but the storyline is one that sticks with you forever. The characters are all fleshed out a lot more in 'GOA' than 'BAS', so we know how Crixus became Champion of Capua, how Oenomaus became Doctore, how Batiatus rose to power, we meet the extremely sexy Gaia! - but most importantly, we are introduced to Gannicus - Possibly the most talented and charismatic of all champions (really? blindfolded?!) Charming, playful, and absolutely deadly with two swords (or without any!), Gannicus actually made me forget about Spartacus not being there. All the characters are well written and of the course the dialogue is memorable and a lot of times laugh out loud hilarious! (""Once again the Gods see fit to shove c**k in a**!"") hahahahah LOVE IT! Never been a show like this in the history of TV and anything after will be a copycat. Truly a Starz ORIGINAL!",2012
1,"I mostly enjoyed the original Spartacus movie as it was historical truth. The first ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" was also the same story and was mostly historically correct. Given the freedom of its cable broadcast it was pretty profane, with graphic sex scenes and much use of the the four letter f**k word. This latest rendition in ""Gods of the Arena"" is just nothing but f**k and very graphic sex. As usual it is sick in its depiction in slow motion of throats slashed, arms severed and blood spurting all over. It's more like the modern video games being pushed where murder, mutilation and mayhem substitute for any true artistic skill or value. The use of profanity reminds me of 14 year old boys who have discovered the f word and use it mercilessly. These writers are the same 14 year old boys. I would much prefer better plot and character development versus falling back every five minutes on nudity and sex and the f word every other second. Basically, this Spartacus is not fit for viewing by any person with intelligence above that of a rock.",2011

I mean nothing comes close to Spartacus, Lucy lawless is goddess, People say this show would be nothing without Andy, I don't agree. THIS SHOW IS NOTHING WITHOUT LUCY. Once Lucy is done with the show, this show will fall apart.",2011
9,"If you are of a sensitive nature, then give this, the latest in the 'Spartacus' TV series, the body-swerve. But if you enjoy lots of chiselled male bodies, plenty of both gender nudity, lots of CG gore and aren't offended by some of the bawdiest language ever put into a TV programme, then Spartacus; Gods of the arena, is for you. Neatly tied in carefully with a brief intro (the finale of the last series, Spartacus, Blood and sand) the story whisks us straight into the early days of the house of Bateatus as the scheming Roman builds his gladiatorial house against all the politicking and sexual shenanigans of the vicious and cut-throat world around him. There can't be many sentences where 'cock' is not used, and f**k is thrown about liberally too - as I say, not for the easily shocked, but Chaucerian in its vulgarity! And the reference to Shakespeare? There can equally be few TV programmes where characters say lines like, ""He arrives. Let us end discussion and set mind to purpose..."" Straight out of Shakespeare for fifth year! So, yes, an eminently suitable successor to Blood and Sand, and will not disappoint the same audience. I feel a need to give it a thumbs up - and let it live for longer to carry on the games!",2011

The show is very close to porn at times(men and women fully nude) so if you do not wish to see that sort of thing don't watch. The seen are bloody, and gruesome it is full of action. There isn't much left to imagination. I like the story and the wording used by the actors. There is a lot of cursing, to much I believe but effective. Remember the time frame this picture represents were gold rules he who has the gold has the power. The actor John Hannah part is done very well I wait to see what he will do next. It is easy to know what, but in what means will he do it.",2011
1,"I thought the first one was truly hideously BAD, but this is even worse, if that is at all possible. Basically, this is soft core sado-porn for gay men. So if you're into watching muscle men slice each other up with graphic computer animation blood and gore, then by all means watch this. Otherwice, steer clear. This must be the nadir for Hannah, but then he never had much talent to begin with, and an obviously gay man pretending to be a straight villain is really pathetic. Leave it to the actors who can act! Stick to light gay comedies, John. The only one who comes out less than scathed here is Lucy. Of course, the guys must have had a good time, Lots of gay orgies while they weren't on set I bet.",2014

""No Strings Attached,"" the first of at least three 2011 films about non-committal sex (with ""Friends with Benefits"" and ""Hall Pass"" in hot pursuit), is only sparsely amusing and never insightful. Big surprise. Who would have guessed that a 64-year-old director would be the wrong choice for a movie about hip people half his age? ""No Strings Attached"" might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it.",2011

Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together.",2011

7,"Natalie Portman comes out of award season on top with her numerous Best Actress Awards for her performance in ""Black Swan"" including the Critic's Choice Award, the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar in the near future. Now she takes on the romantic comedy genre for the first time since her 2004 hit ""Garden State"". Her costar Ashton Kutcher on the other hand is no stranger to the romantic comedy genre with most of his recent films falling into this genre (""Killers"", ""Valentine's Day"", and ""What Happens In Vegas""). Together they create comedy through the awkwardly realistic chemistry between their characters Emma and Adam. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. This leads them to becoming acquaintances throughout the early years of their relationship until they are thrown into each other's lives for the last time. Emma is a successful doctor who works eighty hours a week and is not looking for a relationship, while Adam is an aspired writer looking for a break working at a ""gleeish"" television show. Their latest encounter leads the two into a sexual dilemma as they make a pact to enter into a relationship with ""No Strings Attaches"" in other words no commitment, just sex. However, eventually the strings have to be attached.",2011

They end up falling for each other, tempers flare, and break up. Moderately dramatic event occurs that brings them back together again. It may sound like the outline of every Matthew McConaughey film, and now it's also the recycled theme of No Strings Attached.",2011
3,"The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give their awards conditionally. If you receive an Academy Award for best actor/actress, and then demean it by acting poorly in a subsequent film, you should forfeit the award. This is akin to behaving in a manner unbecoming a professional. Now, I wasn't a big fan of Black Swan, but I did think Natalie Portman deserved the Best Actress award. After watching No Strings Attached, I wonder if I, and others, had been fooled. Admittedly, she didn't have much of a script to work with here in No Strings. At best, her character was two dimensional. But then, she was one of the producers. You'd think she would have been able to tell a flawed script when she saw one.",2011
7,"""No Strings Attached"" works precisely for one reason, its script. Paramount Pictures, the studio backing the film, allowed the script to be R rated, meaning that ""grown up"" words, the ones that are four letters and need to be bleeped out from standard radio and television could be said. For a film that is about casual sex--one that tries to portray its characters as realistic--these words need to be included in the characters' dialogue. So, yes, thank you Paramount for allowing the script to be R rated.",2011
2,"Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) have known each other since childhood, but not to damage their friendship, Emma offers a no strings attached relationship which means they can boink anyone they want and each other too and falling in love is out of the question. ",2011
2,I gave it a 2.,2011
6,"I had very low expectations for No Strings Attached. The couple would make the decision to use each, one would fall for the other, and in the end they would live happily ever after. I was correct about the overall story line, but, impressively, the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that, there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!",2011

Adam's life is falling apart: his father (Kevin Kline) is dating his ex (Ophelia Lovibond) and his writing career is going nowhere. He hooks up with Emma, who has a phobia of dating and they agree to continue seeing each other in a series of one-night stands. Things get complicated, however, when they begin developing feelings for each other North of their belt-lines.",2011
8,"This movie has an awful start, but it improved a LOT. As was stated in another review ""can I finger you"" is an awful way to start. It's the perfect way to show the attitude of an ass. Moving through the movie the characters played by Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher made the story real. They also changed a lot through the film. Kutcher's two male friends did not add a lot except to make rude suggestions. Thankfully the two main characters carried the film. No Strings Attached showed how people need attachment, not just to feel good. My wife says I like ""chick flicks"" better than she does, and I rate this one pretty high because of the story.",2011
1,"What's Ludicrous doing in this movie. I think maybe it's because this movie has to have that one token black guy who hangs around yuppies all day. What were the producers thinking. Ya, throw Luda in there. That'll make it believable. I have yet to see something where he shows at least a shred of acting ability. If you thought he was bad in this, you should have seen him host SNL. Plus I don't know what's up with Natalie Portman. She is actually an alright actor but she doesn't seem believable at all. I don't know about her breaking out a tennis racket on those bitches or what about the part where she's screaming or jumping on Ashton when she's upset at him. This chick just can't do comedy. She's safe doing dramas. I didn't laugh once at this film. SO PREDICTABLE. Even the one-liners. The lil wayne references, the whole ""this is your fault that I'm pregnant!"" The first girlfriend was too dumb to even be alive. I've noticed that there where a lot of F bombs in this movie. I think that's the new recipe. Throw some F bombs in there, it'll make the jokes a little more funny. This movie was crap. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay to see this since it's on Netflix.",2012
1,"Well, this movie offers to change course of a relationship: usually, the couple meets, discovers each other and finally expresses their communion in an intimate relationship. Here, it's the opposite: they begin with intercourse and they want to achieve more. Well, this idea leaves me completely cold, as I don't want such experience. ",2013
2,The main reason this movie isn't good is that their is too little chemistry between Asthon and Natalie. Physically he is too big for her. In terms of persona they are too incompatible as well. They look like they could never hook up in real life.,2012
4,"A lot of people may know that the raunchy ""friends having sex"" comedy, ""Friends with Benefits"", with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, is actually a lot similar to a movie released months before called ""No Strings Attached"", with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. But trust me, you would rather see ""Friends with Benefits"". Yes, it's touching at times, and there are few funny chuckles. But this movie just defines the phrase ""romantic comedy"" in a very ""not so good"" way. Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher star as Emma and Adam, two ""friends with benefits"" who have a sexual relationship, and they make sure to not crush on each other. Portman is lovely, but she makes me lose my last nerve with all of her complaining and all of her crankiness. I don't care if she's scared of commitment, so I just wish that she would just accept the commitment, and stop complaining about it already. Kutcher wasn't really that funny in this movie, and he only delivers a few chuckles. But he's still a pretty cool guy in this movie. It takes forever to get through this entire relationship. The sex scenes both start and end too quickly, and we are left with a boring remaining piece of the movie filled with cheesy clichés and loss of laughter. A fine actor that looks embarrassed to be in this mess is Kevin Kline, who plays Kutcher's father 'slash' former T.V. actor, a weed-smoking, body-building idiot who ends up hooking up with young, 20-year-old women. Oh, that's hilarious...not! This is a slow and cheesy romantic comedy without the heart, and without the laugh-out-loud laughs, when all we get are chuckles. When the movie tries to be heartwarming, it just leaves to be too predictable. Director Ivan Reitman should have known that this was not the right movie for him to be directing. Why should he waste his time on a useless sex comedy? I really thought that this movie was going to be okay, so I'm kind of disappointed. But everything from the useless sex scenes to the cheesy romance, I see this more as a drama, more than a romantic comedy. This movie has a great premise, but it's done in a weird point of view. Portman and Kutcher make good chemistry, but they mostly struggle during the sex scenes and emotional scenes. This movie really tried it's best to be a fun and entertaining film, but even if this movie didn't make me want to kill myself, or I wasn't thinking that I wanted to hate this movie with so much fury, it instead just made me say ""no"" to myself, and then I forgot about this movie in the next minute. ""No Strings Attached"", in my review, ""a shamefully obnoxious sex comedy that drags"".",2012
4,"I could barely get into the movie, let alone sit through it because I had a hard time buying Natalie Portman as the character she was playing. She's such an annoying over-achiever (and people rag on Kate Winslet for doing too much). Ashton Kutcher on his own was his usual self, not trying to out-act anyone or gun for an Oscar or anything. That coupled with the fact that this film seemed very similar to another terrible film I saw recently 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler. It's like we've run out of ideas and we're just coasting on the past ideas of others hoping something hits and works for the next set of coasters to come along and rehash our own copied ideas. The scary part is that this film was a hit people, so you can expect more like it coming to a theater near you sooner than you think. That said, I think Katherine Heigl should have played this role instead of Natalie Portman.",2011
1,"I saw maybe 20 minutes before I had to turn it off. I like Ashton Kutcher OK and I really like Natalie Portman, but both of them are completely wooden. The writing is horrid. Sometimes it seems like the characters are having two different conversations at the same time. It is so formulaic I think it may have been written on graph paper. The sex is completely lacking in passion. The friendships are baseless and without affection or any semblance of reality. I don't know how they were able to make two such physically attractive people so repulsive. I didn't remotely care about any of the characters. Nor did like any of them. It was so bad I was unwilling to watch another minute, even with the possibility of Natalie Portman nudity. I challenge you to try watching further than 20 minutes.",2012
1,"""No Strings Attached"" poses the question: Is it possible to have sex with someone without risking that you could fall in love with them? The answer is YES. It also poses the question: Is it possible to make a clichéd and hackneyed film that smells like ass? The answer is YES.",2011

1,"Let me start by saying that I would claim these movies to be in the best of cinema category if they just changed the genre from ""drama, romance, horror"" to ""comedy"". That's seriously all they need to do because the awful dialog is back, the horrendous story and the terrible characters are back. You know the funny thing is, the story actually has some extreme potential to be a great horror story with some in depth drama and dimensional characters with a powerful conflict. A vampire has sex with a human impregnating her with a child that will most likely kill her but she doesn't want to give the baby up so easily. But this is Twilight, where Bella Swan likes to play boys back and forth like a pin pon ball and the boys are chumps.",2012
1,"I watched the first movie in the saga because my wife loved the books. I must say, the acting was good, except for Stewart who is a cold fish. She looks confused or depressed.

It was a tough decision, because that would imply that there's some sort of plot line that I may ruin inadvertently... rest assured, there isn't.

But after sitting through this.... thing....for two hours, I thought that I simply MUST write a review. I haven't felt this motivated and energized to write a review in ages! I simply had to start typing as soon as I got home! My goal: to stop just one person from seeing this film.

There is about 20 minutes of action and the rest is Bella pregnant and dying. The end. No, seriously. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. If it didn't have such a big budget and hype it would rank with one of the worst horror movies out there. The movie is plain stupid and cheesy and by far the worst of the series.

No real emotions, or a connection with the audience. Thank god i downloaded this, and therefor didn't waste any money on it. I liked the first Twilight movie. Because, like someone else said, it was new and exciting. But this one, no, simply horrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only reason this movie is not a huge flop. Is because of all the 12 year old girls who watch it without considering the over all quality of the film. I hope movies like this, does not become a trend within the movie community. Its nothing but a forced, and failed try, in making a good sequel to the first movie, and a good adaptation of the book.",2012

1,"I hate Twilight a lot. But nobody can say I am unfair towards it. The third film was actually entertaining and less infuriating. Breaking Dawn Part 1, is different altogether. It is just a horrible product shoved out with no regard for its audience. Bella and Edward get married and go on honeymoon, this last for over an hour. She gets pregnant, which shouldn't be able to happen, and some potentially evil demon baby is sucking the life from her. The films biggest crime is that nothing happens for so long. This series has had a tendency to drag on and on. With New Moon seeming totally unnecessary. What happens here, is that we get one book split into two films. This film has about 30 minutes of material in it. Characters have the same conversations they've had a thousand times before, with nobody evolving. Bella and Edward feel the same way they've always felt, as does Jacob. The sex scene is embarrassingly juvenile, with a quick cut to something from a parody. The film doesn't let up in the absurdity department, as some animated wolves have a conversation with each other, but with mindless growling and dialog, it sounds terrible. What any other film would have shortened into a montage is played out to a variety of banal songs that all sound the same. Finally we get towards the end and the graphic, grotesque birth scene is barely shown at all. It leaves us with a finale in which a wolf ""imprints"" himself onto a newborn baby in a scene more disturbing than anything The Human Centipede could muster. If you like characters that whine about everything, actors that have no emotional range, and watching slideshows of other people's honeymoons, then you may enjoy this laughable effort.",2012

Twilight this time is a big shame for all the audiences! The Whole Movie Was about the baby , they wanna have sex , etc! it's not even romantic! At least , they should've prepared it as a 3D movie! i really went out the cinema very angry and i wanted to have my money back! Don't Ever Waste your money on this movie! go watch another movie ! maybe some twilight fans might like it ! if u like twilight you're gonna rate it as 5/10 and if you're not you're gonna give it a zero!

AND that you should always ALWAYS give birth to WHATEVER ""child"" you're carrying, no matter of how it got there or if it so will kill you!!! All the while, ALL THE WHILE; This utterly boring little slut, with NO character or personality (or acting skills for that matter) what so ever, is playing with two guys FOR YEARS! So, you have a movie that is openly trying to teach Christian (Mormon) ""values and morale"", BUT is saying at the same time that it's completely OK for you to be a horny little 'beep' who manipulates people and keeps them from living their own life...And if you think they might be slipping away, here's an idea NAME YOUR FREAKING MISTAKE OF A CHILD with BOTH of the guys names!!! Gaaah!!!! NOT TO FORGET that the bruises in the movie, that were caused by Eddie ""The hair"" dear's ""vampire strength"" is in fact in the book bruises cause he beat her, so that's another great Mormon message for all your daughters, submission to your man, no control over your own body AND you should accept the occasional beating once you have the ring on your finger.

2,"The films starts with the wedding invitations, progresses to the wedding itself, after which (skeleton) Stewart and Patterson ('The Hair') will go on a honeymoon, where Stewart will get pregnant, and she eventually almost dies. That's it. Two hours, and that's it. After the first part I've found myself thinking that it wasn't as boring as I expected it to be, in all honesty. But then I thought about it, and realized it's just like going to McD or BK (or any places like this). You go there because you fancy a hamburger or cheeseburger, take your pick. While you're eating it, you think it's not bad, but afterwards you're wondering, what was it that I ate? What is that hamburger made of, and that cheese tasted like garbage... It's exactly the same with this film. You watch it because you fancy a nice, emotional, non-intellectual random film. Afterwards, you'll find yourself thinking: what the *** was this? The first hour mainly contained Stewart and Patterson making out, and making out, and making out even more! Not even at the wedding Stewart looked happy, nor at the honeymoon. I was disappointed by the cheekiness of the film, especially the first half. It was so bad! Seriously, take a bowl, you're going to puke. And not because of the amount of blood, because frankly it's hardly there. The second part,I admit was slightly better. Lautner was also disappointing to me, though, his acting doesn't come through to me. It just stays on the screen. The wolf part was actually quite cool, where Lautner would stand up for Stewart and her child, and when he could hear voices. But the vampires fighting with the wolves? Not so much, I found myself thinking: whatever. Seriously. Awkward when Patterson realized that Lautner had imprinted on his daughter. If I were a father, I'd freak out. Honestly, he fell in love with Stewart, who is his age, and then falls in love with her daughter? I wouldn't sound cool. At all. The best part was the transformation. How on the outside, she lookes dead, and the shots from her veins, where you see the venom spread, is very well done. Well done, Condon, I knew you had it in you.

Many of the scenes were obvious fillers with terrible dialogue.

If you know even a few things about Greek mythology then do NOT watch it. I didn't expect them to follow it completely but since they are using the names of heroes and gods they could at least use their background.,2011
5,"If you're going to mess up Greek mythology, I guess you might as well make it pretty. Immortals is a semi-related-sequel to the incredible film 300, which not only looked beautiful but had this incredible story of triumph and strength, overcoming powerful numbers with a sense of knowing who you are and the pride you have. Immortals was created by director Tarsem Singh who also directed The Cell, which was an alright story followed up by some great visuals, the same thing happens here. I think Tarsem is just known for making a beautiful movie with a weak story, he's more of a visualist rather than a story teller. I still couldn't wait to see Immortals and sadly was very disappointed, unfortunately this was just a weak story with some bizarre miscasts.",2011

Which is exactly what is the problem with all types of candy; eye candy or the actual food itself. It's not until you're finished devouring such huge portions of it you realize you've absorbed absolutely nothing.",2011

DON'T BOTHER with the 3D as it ads NOTHING to the movie.

2,"I hadn't seen any previews going into this movie. I was just out with friends and went along with what they wanted to see because, hey, I like pretty much all movies (emphasis on ""pretty much"" in this case). This movie could have been really good. It really could have been. But the plot had major holes and attempted to do too much without the development to support it. Everything just flitted between one thing and the next. One second the Virgin Oracle was determined to keep her virginity and her gift (foresight). The next minute (and for no apparent reason) she decides she wants to give it up for the chance to be ""normal"" and has sex with the main character. This was completely and entirely just for a meaningless sex scene. They hardly interact for the rest of the movie. Beyond that, there's a 20th century style dam which they are using as a wall. Okay sure, but why is it in the middle of a desert with a mountain next to it that looks like it has always just been a mountain? Plot hole. And okay, so Titans vs. Greek Gods, it isn't original but it has the potential to be good. But why do the titans look like they were covered in gray paint and made to wear silly helmets? And why do they keep flying out of the floor in an endless stream? I really could keep going. Like, why were they determined to find the bow when the King couldn't find it. So by finding it they were leaving it open to be stolen (which it was... immediately). Just don't go to it. Rent Alexander or Agora or a mindless action movie by someone like Steve Austin. Just... Avoid.",2011

Let's face it, the previews show nothing but action and that's why we pay the big bucks for Imax 3D films but when the action is nestled in between long, long drawn out and ill-formed dialogue (I honestly thought lines were forgotten in many scenes and they were running low on budget or time and just went with it) and extremely poor story-telling.....you start to feel duped. When you spend more mental energy thinking about another Coke Icee, you know you've just padded Hollywood's pockets.",2011
8,"I went to this movie on a whim and because my friends pushed me to it. I have to say that I did not regret going. The story plays out well throughout with some rushed character development and cut corners in storytelling. However, the direction was top notch, the visuals were beautiful, and the casting was even better. Mickey Rourke did an amazing job as King Hyperion, the villain you love to hate. The thing that excited me the most about this movie is how well the action and fight scenes were choreographed. I always choose story over action when it comes to films but this movie far exceeded my expectations where action was concerned. I can't stress that the story was still a good one but the choreography and intensity of the action lets you care about little else.",2011

1,"The plot felt like something written the night before a deadline by someone who once heard about Greek myths several years ago, but hasn't done any research on them. Certain aspects of the scenery were obviously chosen because they look sorta Greek, with no thought of checking with an ancient historian. The characters are boring and one-dimensional. The suggestion that the characters were based on Greek myths is laughable. The whole film looks like it was filmed in sepia - but for the pretty golden gods, the shiny silvery plastic breastplates and the unlikely blue cloaks - I can only assume in an effort to look gritty and interesting. Someone on the design team seems rather obsessed with stupid-looking hats too: gods and mortals alike provoked laughter over their headwear. The overall message of the film seemed to be a very American one: atheists are evil/stupid and faith in the gods/God is the only way of winning. Also apparently negotiation is pointless. Overall, the the film was a mess - badly plotted, with a see-through message, full of anachronisms and just dull. It tried to hard and fell short.",2011
7,"First the movie. Like many (including most of the reviewers here) I was not that impressed on first viewing. This, by the way, is a peculiarity with certain kinds of movies, movies where the uniqueness of the story (or action) tend to raise expectations higher than they should be. Human nature being what it is, if you watch a film with high expectations and it lets you down, it must, ergo, the film's fault. Usually it is. But I had occasion to watch this film two more times in different environments and, with no expectations to speak of, it was better in almost every way than I first remembered. And the deal closer here is Rourke. Hard to believe that, in days gone by (not Ancient Greece, but close) he was a Hollywood pretty-boy playing hi-impact romantic leads. As most of you (probably) know, he dropped out sight for a spell and then reappeared in 2008's THE WRESTLER where his let-it-all-hang-out performance blew away both critics and audiences. In 2010 he popped up again as a bad guy in the otherwise forgettable (PLEASE FORGET IT) Ironman 2. His casting as a uber-bad guy in a super hero film caught a number of eyeballs, and his performance was arguably the most memorable thing in the picture. Dennis Miller, who had a nightly talk show at the time, got a lot laughs by running a small clip of Rourke from IM2 -- a scene where Rourke's character is sauntering down a major boulevard turning cars to cinders with his magic whip-- and then asking the rhetorical audience, in Miller's unique deadpan style, ""I wonder if Mickey realizes he is actually in a movie?"" This film arrived a year after IM2 and Rourke really chews the scenery here. It is hard to keep a straight face when every second piece of dialog you have is a promise that your lineage will rule the earth for centuries to come. But Rourke pulls it off. For this unique performance, and allowing for the over-expectations of audiences at the time of release, I believe this film deserves a higher rating than it currently has.",2014
3,"In the trailer, they mentioned prominently it was from the 300 producers, probably to entice 300 fans into watching it. Well, what difference does the director make then! This is from the guy who directed The Cell (with Jennifer Lopez) and more recently Mirror, Mirror (with Julia Roberts). Here, the director was rather good with the visuals (as he usually is) but managed to tell a weak disjointed story where we don't really care about the characters or the proceedings. It felt as if some important transitional or plot scenes were left on the cutting floor (no, they're not in the deleted scenes). For example, a few times I didn't know why certain characters were at a certain place. Finding the main artifact felt nonsensical and anti-climatic. The acting was mundane, the characters kinda thin, except perhaps for the gruff villain played by Mickey Rourke and Zeus (in his different incarnations) who were more somewhat complex and interesting. A speech by the hero obviously intended to be stirring actually felt corny, and had for me the opposite effect. Perhaps worst of all, the chemistry between two of the leads was absent making their romance feel rushed and unbelievable.",2012
1,This is a really stupid movie.,2011
7,"When I first saw the trailer to this movie I thought it would be a lame movie that has mythological elements in it like the recent ""Clash of the Titans"" movie. But this movie I gotta admit is much better with the direction and the gory and bloodiness of it all. The movie is brutal like how mythological movies like this should be. The story isn't anything amazing or anything like that but the cinematography, the violence and the mythological powers that is portrayed in this movie makes it worth a watch. The parts where the gods comes down to intervene or just fight is very cool to watch and is some of the most entertaining parts of the movie. If the story was good as some of the sequences in this movie this could have easily been a must see movie of 2011. But still it's a entertaining flick that I didn't regret forking over few bucks to see in theater.",2011
10,"When i saw the previews for this film i was underwhelmed and brushed it under the rug, disturbed at them trying to top 300 after Clash of the Titans came out. I must admit i was pleasantly surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this film from beginning to end. Tarsem knew exactly what he wanted and its evident in every shot. The cinematography was magnificent, the set design was superb and the costumes were just gorgeous. The fight scenes were definitely impressive and left me mumbling ""yeah"" and ""that what im talking about"" under my breath. ",2011
6,"The picture is a fun sword and sandals epic with stirring adventures , struggles , bizarre scenarios and turns out to be an acceptable story and quite entertaining . The story is very loosely based on Greek mythology , creating a potpurrí of Gods and legends , mingling elements of various myths . As screen writers state that they chose to change many aspects of the ancient Greek stories to reflect the fact that the Greeks themselves often revised their mythology to conform to new ideas and knowledge . In Classical Greek mythology , Immortals were members of the second order of divine beings, descending from the primordial deities and preceding the Olympian deities . Based on Mount Othrys, the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of the primordial Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Heaven). They were giant deities of incredible strength, who ruled during the legendary Golden Age , and also composed the first pantheon of Greek deities . As they had overthrown the primordial deities, the Immortal Titans were overthrown by younger gods, including many of their own children - the Olympians - in the Titanomachy (or ""War of the Titans""). There were twelve Olympian gods and goddesses and they were immortal and unkillable as well . The Greeks may have borrowed this mythology from the Ancient Near East . There were only 12 titans in the myths and they were immortal and invincible . There was a war in the heavens and the Titans lost . Zeus then threw them into Tartarus , which is represented as a mountain in the movie, but in the old myths was a cave at the center of the Earth with minor similarities to Hell, to be imprisoned for all eternity . The picture takes Greek Gods here and there , as in the myths , Theseus (Henry Cavill , he trained for 8 hours 5 days a week to get in shape for the film) was actually King of Athens and (in some versions) a son of Poseidon (Greek god of sea and Zeus' brother, being played by Kellan Lutz), although his legal father was King Aegeus of Athens . Theseus killed the Minotaur , a creature with the body of a man and a head of a bull imprisoned in a labyrinth, depicted here as a man with a helmet made of wires and horns with the help of princess Ariadne whom he later married . In the Theseus story, Crete had its capital at Knossos, and its ruler was cruel King Minos , here Hyperion (Mickey Rourke , he chose to do this movie instead Conan , 2011) defies the Greek God , Zeus (Luke Evans ,he appeared a year earlier as Zeus' son Apollo in Clash of Titans) . Hyperion origin is from a different myth, and was the name of one of the 12 Titans . Epirus Bow doesn't exist in any mythology, but it might be inspired by the bow of Heracles aka Hercules which was used by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the great war . Other Gods appearing are the followings : Apollo (Corey Sevier) , Athena or Minerva (Isabel Lucas) who is the daughter of Zeus (or Jupiter) and Metis, a daughter of the Titans, and goddess of wisdom , Heracles (Steve Byers) ,a son of Zeus who was the only hero to ascend to Olympus to rule with the Gods and Poseidon , he is the Greek god of the sea, equivalent to the Roman Neptune . Furthermore , Sibyl (Freida Pinto, though Lily Collins auditioned for a part, but was turned down by director) was the ancient Roman title for prophetesses . ",2015
1,"I wasn't expecting much. Really. I was prepared for the raping and gutting of the Greek mythology, and I got what I expected in spades. I was prepared for the total of lack of a consistent, comprehensible plot, and the movie didn't let me down. I was prepared for poor acting - check! I was prepared for all kinds of anachronisms - they were all there! The story of Hyperion trying to wreak his vengeance on the gods (thank you, IMDb reviewers, you helped me understand what the hell he was actually driving at with all this running around and butchery) and the story of Theseus achieving his hero's status are intertwined in a manner worthy of a five-year-old composing a story with nothing better to do; there are not many logical links between scenes and events and no smooth unfolding of a story in general. This is what makes it so excruciatingly boring. However, as I said, for all that I was prepared. ",2011
7,"I had been looking forward to this one since I saw the first trailer ages ago. It really showed some moments of awesome, and it had the potential of being 300-2. However, I was a little disappointed with the pacing (a bit too slow in my opinion) and I was surprised that I wasn't surprised about the ending (if that makes any sense?). Special detail was paid to the aesthetics, with interesting compositions and scene transitions, which is always glad to look at. It has one of the best speeches pre-war that I can remember (you could see that one from the trailer, although it's better on the film), and some scenes have been improved since the trailer (the break-rock-and-unclick-apart effect doesn't exist anymore, and it's now a much better scene). Anyway, it's worth a watch, but it's not the homecoming of the second resurrection of the Greek Gods. Oh, and definitely better than Clash of the Titans.",2011
1,"After having watched the 300, i had high expectations on this movie. As you know, its about War between gods, titans and men. ",2012
2,"From gods fighting kung-fu style to titans looking like fast moving humanoid zombies, this movie left an uneasy feeling in my mind for the poor producer shelling out 75 mil dollars to make a movie that the lucky will forget. Lets not be too harsh though - the action scenes appeal to the senses if you're into that sort of thing and I am. Their is quite a bit of gore on display so hack and slash fans will enjoy this as well. But there are just too many inconsistencies with Greek mythology which really hurt sensibilities. You may not feel this so much if your interest in the subject is limited. But there are quite a few scenes that really made my jaw drop at the wonderous stupidity on show. People comparing this to 300 should not. They are leagues apart.",2011
5,"For all those of you who think this might be as good as 300 or better, you will be disappointed. This movie is not worth the ticket. There was so much hype about it, it just doesn't meet the expectations. There were several mythological and historical anomalies. There are some good scenes but they are few and far apart. The movie contains plenty of blood, gore and violence. But be warned, its not sophisticated violence as in most war movies. Its more of a sadistic type of violence.",2011
10,"It's quite rare that a movie i like has got so many bad reviews from IMDb-user database. Imo this was one of the best movies this year, if not the best. Yes, Immortals gives a different image of Greek-mythology gods but don't be so close minded. Action scenes are unique, story ain't that bad, acting is great and the movie ain't boring or too long. If you compare Immortals 75m$ budget with for example Twilight Saga: Breaking dawn 127m$ budget, see the difference? i'd recommend it to anyone who is into this kind of movies, way better than Clash Of The Titans and nearly as good as 300. If you're out of money and you have to choose between this or any of the other movies in cinemas at the moment. Easy pick in my opinion.",2011
9,"First of all, I'm currently doing a degree in History and classics. I really do not understand why people get so annoyed about when characters in movies about the Greek gods are not 'true' to previous representations. For a start there are always more than one version of a Greek heroes story. that he was the son of a king is one, another is that his mother was raped by Poseidon (in human form of course, so could have been a 'villager' like in the movie) and that he was brought up be his grandfather (like his mentor in the movie) so actually it's not that far removed, if you take it from that version. I could go on using other examples from other reviews but I think I've made my point. Also, a few people are saying that the oracle having sex with him is gratuitous. Well, I don't remember at any time the Oracle saying SHE was actively trying to protect her gift, everyone else was doing it. Theseus guesses at her true feelings about her 'gift' and she says he's right, so actually, it's not that much of a shock. Also, for those saying they don't interact enough after - you obviously HAVEN'T read many Greek myths ;p Besides, it not a romance movie! I was impressed with the acting, being slightly worried at first about Mickey Rourke, and the CGI was good and non-intrusive, there's nothing worse than fussy overdone CGI-scapes ruining the feel of the movie. I actually found it had more brains than 300, which for me was very much a ""LAAADS WHEEEEY"" movie, where as this, although violent pretty much the whole way through, never felt gratuitous and was always interesting/exciting. As for the appearance of the Titans offending some people = who is to say what the Titans looked like? They were cosmic representations of different aspects of nature - and they seemed to do pretty well in the fighting stakes, so not really seeing the issue there either... Although, I do draw the line at Athena dying. That's just ridiculous. I think people go to these films with their 'critical hats' on, and just ruin any enjoyment that you can get out of a film like this. Just relax and enjoy the 'ride'! My boyfriend thought it was the best film he'd seen all year, and better in lots of ways than 300, too. Just my opinion, anyways!",2011

I spent 5 summers watching this show only to have the climatic victory last around 10 minutes. They tried to introduce too many new characters and story lines with very few episodes left, leaving the last season feeling crowded and unfinished. The aliens entire reason for the invasion might be one of the stupidest moments I've seen on TV, right up there with the Rachel/Joey romance and that weird ending to Lost with all it's flash forwards and sideways crap the last few seasons. I mean come on, earth defeated the aliens once with sticks and rocks and it took these guys 5 years to do it? I'm not buying it.

8,"I do not understand why so many people are being so harsh regarding this show. Yeah, its basically ""The Walking Dead"", except with aliens...but I think this is a good thing. Unlike ""V"", this is a show that focuses on the survivors. Many reviewers have said that the characters are clichés. However, I would simply call them archetypes and I thoroughly enjoy watching most of the characters when they are on screen. It seems that many reviewers have based their opinions on the first 2 episodes. However, with so many characters, it takes time to get to know them. The show definitely starts off at a slow-burn. I think many people are having the same problem with this show as they did with ""48 Days Later"". Many people wanted to see a zombie horror movie. However, once they realized that the movie was a human drama and the zombies where more of a situation that humanity had to deal with, the reviewers whined that the movie sucked. ""Falling Skies"" is the same way. The show is not about aliens. The alien invasion is just the situation. The show is about the human drama that is the result of the situation. Watch more than just 2 episodes before you form an opinion. I think that you will enjoy it.",2011
3,"OK, i've made it to the third season. What did i see until now? A bunch of people survives an alien invasion, tries to group up with other survivors across the USA and tries to fight back the bad aliens helped by the good ones, which arrive without any decent explanation, the most obvious deus-ex-machina ever. in like in more than 1200 minutes of series this is all that happens: so whats the deal you say? Well, actually there is none. This series a MEGA LOAD of useless and empty dialogues, between stereotyped characters, mixed with all those ""already seen"" family dramas (the lost/captured/infected son, the boyfriend/girlfriend, the hard role of the leader/father and every clichè you ever seen in any post-apocalyptic movie/series). Topped with ultra evolved aliens with ROBO MECHS who cant even aim at a car and shoot randomly killing 1 human out of 100 alien-plasma-gatling-rocket gun ammos. But hey, lets shoot that bad ass alien war machine with my ak-47, i like the sound of bouncing bullets. Really stay away from this, sci-fi doesn't have ANYTHING to do with this series, because the prefix SCI actually means that there is something scientific in it, while there is not. There is no logic in the behaviour of characters, in the action scenes, everything is driven by what every stereotyped character has to do to fulfill his predictable and boring role. If this wasn't from Spielberg it'd have died in one or two season, i can guarantee you that. Or maybe even not, considering another series which is the copy of this (yes, The Walking Dead) had an unbelievable success where i found it the most boring, melodramatic, stereotyped, zombie flick ever, even among some b movies. Im giving this a 3 just because the majority of actors are good and the CGI as well, too bad all those good resources were wasted on a SO EMPTY storyline. There is a ton of good series that are worth your time if you're looking for some sci-fi, don't force yourself to get to the point when you're watching the screen after 120 minutes and think ""my GOD is something entertaining gonna happen or what!?"". Spielberg phone home and never come back.",2014
5,"After watching the entire show - honestly, after S2, continued to watch just because I really respect Steven Spielberg - gave it 5 out of 10 stars because it's average in just about every category. There is no clear story line, most of the key events happen randomly, out of nowhere, and the pace also seems to be changing at random. Also, you just know, since day one, which characters are expendable, and which ones will survive. No matter what happens, no matter how cornered they appear to be, the Masons always manage to pull out easily. Surrounded by 1000 Skitters? No problem, there's probably a subspace turbomodulator buried right under their feet. There's a top secret enemy agenda that could turn the tide of the war at the last moment? No problem, there's a random orange semi-sphere, made by the enemy, that has only one purpose: to transmit those super-secret messages to those who touch it. Sorry, I HONESTLY believe I wrote smarter sci-fi stuff back when I was a 14-year old kid. As sci-fi as a genre declines even further, the audience seems not to care at all about the quality of the shows anymore. Honestly, I'm surprised by the number of people calling this show a good, fresh or smart one. It's really not.",2015

Seasons 1-3 were constantly moving between 'good' and 'excellent', at least for me, But unfortunately the show took a real dive from Season 4 Episode 1, and like most people, I went from an avid fan to someone who quit watching after no longer being able to justify my time on it.",2014

I enjoy the gritty depiction of humanities struggle for survival, yet their ability to unite together in such odds. I enjoy the progressive discovery of how the aliens think and feel. They don't dumb them down and make them simply a tyrannical race that is out to destroy the world, nor do they make them unbeatable. The Visual effects have some very strong moments. They are not afraid to show the aliens and they also do not steer in any open ended directions. They meet questions that arise head on. ",2011
5,"Season one of Falling Skies was fantastic: battles, high budget special effects that look like an A list movie, and a main character who is likable and relatable because he will do literally anything to protect his boys.

I am not one to judge too quickly and I thought the series might be a slow burner - but sadly it was a dud with Spielberg's dead formulaic hand all over it. I had enjoyed the first few series but the later ones rather than building on the earlier efforts are just hideous. There are so many unbelievable events, not just physically unbelievable but emotionally and logically. It is an unholy mess driving onwards to a climax I don't care about anymore. This is a bad series, with no real development of the characters. Some of the leads, who are very good actors try their best - but it's not enough. When it comes down to it, the reason why this is a pile of chowder is the fault of the great fish head who made his name with another fish.

7,"Stephen Soderbergh's latest direction, ""Contagion"" (2011), even though bringing less than expected excitement, is an absorbing movie to watch, efficient as a social and behavioural study, but no less as an accomplished collection of individual case studies, offering sufficiently thought-provoking arguments, such as the fact that--despite all the scientific advances and exhaustive efforts of the thousands of specialists--humankind still stands pretty helpless in the prevention of new viral outbreaks and their many strains occurring globally, when even seemingly well organised societies easily slip into chaos, leaving all individuals to fend for themselves in the ultimate fight for survival, all further fuelled by unstoppable leaks (however, lucrative sensationalism, as well) on an almost inevitable, mutually supportive (money and power shouldn't mix, but mostly they do) corporal and governmental cover-ups. Surely it is a disturbing reminder that even at the most difficult of times, humanity's good traits still get so easily overpowered by the seed of all evil--selfishness and greed.",2011
7,"Not much to say that hasn't been already the critics are right, it is an effective slick movie that may be a bit slight as far as character development but doesn't suffer too badly for it. This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing. ",2011
8,"One would think that the last thing we need is another outbreak movie. But that's not the case when the latest of the genre is directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. Contagion wins for this years most ridiculously impressive cast lineup, as it is an ensemble picture about a deadly viral outbreak that affects the entire world. We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus, along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas, but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.",2011
8,"I can see why some people might be a bit disappointed in this movie, because it's a pretty realistic on a pandemic, without a main heroic character or even action really. It's full dialogue-driven scenes, and most of the characters aren't really fleshed out.",2011
7,"I saw this movie at a pre-screening in St. Louis. I thought it was good, and I did enjoy it, but I also thought it could have been better. It's about a virus outbreak that is untreatable, and threatens the whole world's population. I thought it had a kind of 'CSI' vibe to me. I liked the way the story showed what day it was, place, etc, and kind of followed the outbreak across the globe. The acting by Matt Damon and Jude Law was great, but overall it just didn't have enough conflict. I felt like I had seen it before in similar movies, and there was no main protagonist/bad guy to fight against (well, besides the virus itself, of course!) The film made me think about germs, diseases, and government cover ups. Which are all too real even today. I did really like the last scene and how the movie came full circle. Overall though, I felt like it could have gone somewhere, but didn't. But still I enjoyed it and would recommend it, it's just not one of my favorites. 7/10",2011
6,"I was taken off guard when I first watched the trailer for Contagion. It looked like a crazy, off-the-rails thriller that was genuinely terrifying in its depiction of something too close to reality.

But what if we didn't isolate it immediately? Steven Soderbergh's Contagion tries to answer that question with a technique similar to the one he used for Traffic – only with less time on his hands. Although 106 minutes is plenty of time to fill a movie, for a virus ""thriller"" like Contagion there should either: a) more time for characters, or b) less situations and focus on the few.",2012

Fishburne and Damon were very bland. Paltrow was a cameo at best and Law was just bad. The movie started out as so many of this type do... Something happens that promises to change life as we know it or outright destroy it. Okay, promising. However, very quickly the movie starts to drag and drag badly. There is no continuity what so ever, characters who you begin to sympathize with just don't go anywhere. So here is the movie in a nutshell... ***SPOILER ALERT*** A killer virus plagues the world. People Die. A vaccine is developed. People Live. That's it. Honestly with an estimated 60 Million dollar budget they could have done a lot more. The visuals were poor. The acting bland. The plot... WHAT PLOT?",2011
5,"I went to Contagion expecting more than I got. I was told that this movie was realistic in its portrayal of what might happen when a viral pandemic comes to the world. I didn't find it realistic at all especially since we have gone through one recently with H1N1 and we have all seen first hand how quickly the CDC can work. If this movie wasn't about realism then it should have been about interesting characters but it wasn't about that either. Though I like most of the actors in this movie and their acting the parts that they were given to play were poorly done at best and worst at most. The only really flushed out character was Matt Damon. The worse character was poor Judd Law, what in God's name were they smoking when they created his character. I've heard and seen opportunist but this was ridiculous. This movie was slow and boring and could have been so much more.",2011
6,"Contagion is a 2011 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. It is based on a globe-spanning epidemic thriller. Contagion is full of many off putting moments, and Soderbergh has great fun expertly grossing us out, while telling a story, vetted by experts, we're told, that seems all-too plausible.",2014
1,"I had high expectations going in with the star studded cast and a good IMDb rating. The film turned out to be very disappointing. The plot jumps around a ton and because of it it's hard to get a sense of uniqueness and continuity for the characters. Things happen in the movie that are just stupid because a couple times the conclusions are pointlessly left hanging, other times they seem to backtrack. The acting is pretty bad all around, which was surprising. The girl that played Matt Damon's daughter just sucked. The ending was very anti-climactic and somewhat silly, making the whole movie seem quite random. I didn't get a sense at any point that there was a lot of passion put into making this film. There's hardly any action, contrary to it's billing as a action thriller. If they would have added a little more mayhem, guns, boobs, and explosions, it would have compensated for the drab and one- note tones in the movie a little bit. A lot of the characters are outrageously dumb, like Gwenyth Paltrow's character. It's a highly predictable plot with few twists. It keeps your attention most of the way, I'll give it that, but it really wasn't what I was looking for.",2011
5,"Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.",2011
8,"The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. ",2011
6,"I have never seen a movie which could be divided to two parts of ""absolutely amazing"" and ""boring and childish"". The first 80 minutes is awesome, I was shocked by how good this movie was as I had seen some bad reviews on IMDb but then the cheesy part kicked in and ruined the whole thing. ",2011
6,"I don't make movies or review them. I am simply someone who loves going to the movies and have seen more than I can count. I was waiting for Super 8 for about 6 months.

6,"As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.",2011
1,"I went into the theater having heard some Luke warm to bad reviews but was unphased. What do the critics know. The movie starts of kind of slow, with a lot of unexplained tension and drama that is later explained but never really makes much sense. The set up of the lead kids mom dying and it being the drunk father of the female hottie's fault is elaborate but does little for the movie. ",2011

8,"It has been pretty much commented that Super 8 is a tribute to the classic films directed or produced by Steven Spielberg, in which the ordinary life in the suburbs was contrasted with an extraordinary phenomenon which had to be usually faced by the kids or teenagers, while the adults ignored the situations until it was too late. In that aspect, director and screenwriter J.J. Abrams achieved exactly what he proposed to himself, even though he had to sacrifice any trace of originality or surprise in the film. However, Super 8 kept me very entertained because of its solid direction, excellent performances and well written screenplay. In summary, this film is an exciting juvenile adventure seasoned with wide doses of ""Spielbergian"" nostalgia.",2011
2,"That's the movie in a few words, in 1979 (I think people have to guess it because in one of the kids rooms there is a poster for Halloween, a much better movie and on a grave it says 1979) kids film a movie where the person in charge, instead of trying to tell a story the kid seems more interested in production value, and then once shooting a scene at a train station because a train is coming and the kid wants production value and a truck hits the train and the kids run away and... after a whole lot of fake CGI effects (the people that liked this movie might've cared but all I thought was ""another explosion? more debris? when will this end?""... might make a decent episode out of Mythbusters though) then what happens the kids regroup in the aftermath, and I find it hard to believe that the height of injury is scraped knees they go to the truck that hit it, I find it even more hard to believe is that it had a head-on-collision with a train and the guy survives with only a few scars.",2011

8,"I remember being only one of the handful of people in Budapest who wanted to see this film in original version (i.e. English audio, no subtitles) on one hot Friday evening in the summer of 2011.

Nevertheless, it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.",2011
1,"The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds.",2011
1,"Super 8 was the worst movie I have seen in the whole year! I really don't understand all of the media hype surrounding this movie. This movie reminded me of a bad ""X-Files"" episode. The first hour is full of very boring dialog. The group of children spend the hour crying about not having enough film for their stupid home movie. I just couldn't stand watching these kids make home movies for the first hour of the movie. I kind of felt like taking a nap. The whole plot is explained and wrapped up in the last 25 minutes of the movie. So you wouldn't miss anything if your arrived very late to the theater. This movie has some ideas from ""Close encounters, The Goonies, and ET"" also a little bit of a bad ""X-Files"" episode thrown in. Don't wasted your money.",2011
1,"Wish there was a 0 rating. The movie was absolutely awful, how many times will directors try to stuff ugly alien with amazing technology down our throat.Very slow narration and build up. Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart.",2011
6,"I really wanted to love this movie. Having grown up in the 80's blessed with so many classic Spielberg movies the thought him making one with JJ Abrahams was tantalizing. Unfortunately, it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies, Jaws, Close encounters, ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost / Cloverfield (which I love) mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching, funny, kids Spielberg movie with a confusing, alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before, I know what's going to happen next, it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better, The Goonies was a classic, ET was a classic, Close Encounters was a classic, Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!",2011
8,"The concept of ""Super 8"" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about ""Super 8"" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing.",2011
5,"This film has wonderful production values and excellent acting. However, it is totally derivative and predictable. I expected much more from Abrams and Spielberg. I can only guess that all of the reviews giving this 9s and 10s were written by 14-year-olds. There is absolutely no suspense. Rather the film goes for shocks - often. Val Lewton first discovered this technique in Cat People and it has been known ever after as a ""bus"". To be effective a bus has to be completely unexpected. Super 8's buses can be seen coming down the street for several blocks. The plot is completely unbelievable. The monster digs a pit and miles of tunnels in one day. I believed this could be done by a flying saucer when Invaders from Mars scared the wits out of me in 1953. But a single monster? And one that could attract tons of metal and magically turn it into a space ship? (Did anyone notice that while the kid's locket was being attracted to the water tower a background character had a necklace that wasn't?) Yet the monster couldn't escape from a box car? And don't get me started on the train wreck. Exciting - sure. But totally breaking the laws of physics. It is impossible for a truck to derail a locomotive on a straightaway. The truck would simply be pushed down the track for however long it took for the engineer to stop the train. And even if the loco derailed the rest of the train wouldn't act like a speeding bullet. Let's just sum it up by saying the great films are able to make you suspend your disbelief even over the most incredible events. Super 8 fails, making it only a so-so film.",2011
10,"I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams, some of his stuff I like, some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved. ",2011
2,JJ Abrams lends his Cloverfield monster to Steven Speilburg to be tamed by 12 year old smart a$$es.

1,"The movies makes no sense's at all and sucks. It's just another humans are bad and everything else in the universe is good movie we all come to love and know.(spoilers alert) here's the whole movie in a nut shell, a advance alien crashes here on earth, and somehow we catch it, then start to torture itwhy???? we'll darn it, why not were humans and that's what we do. Later it peacefully tells the black science guy it's peaceful and just wants to go home, later the black guy crashes his pickup truck into a speeding train and lives to help the giant alien to escape, but is killed by humans later for helping the alien, the kids film the train crash, witch plays no part in the movie at all except for the fact they along with the whole town knows the train crashed, the military destroys and lies and just screws everything up, the alien then makes a rocket out of the towns water tank and fly's away and everyone's dogs go missing but are later to be just relocated to far away places for no purpose I can figure out. the end that's it.",2011
10,"Sketch shows are generally not my thing since they tend to follow a tradition of being campy. Portlandia, on the other hand, is damn straight (and most importantly consistently) funny. I mean where else could I look to see a smart parody of a radical feminist lesbian played by a feminist lesbian? Or catch a glimpse of Kaia Wilson as a cafe customer during a sketch? I realize that these are partially (OK so the latter, completely) personal reasons to enjoy the show only more. However I think that anyone who enjoys absurd comedy with some social criticism would really appreciate the show.",2011
9,"Portlandia is a sketch comedy show that contains two main characters played by Fred Armisen of SNL fame and Carrie Brownstein of popular band Sleater Kinney. These two come up with rad skits in which they play Hippy Vegans, Cult members, Cos Play characters, and Yuppies just to name a few. Every episode contains famous actors, which add to the fun!!",2011

3,I'm not sure if I just don't understand the subject or what the show was trying to accomplish. I was in high school in the early/mid 90s and very little of the material in the show resonates with me.,2012
8,"This is brilliant. It is so offbeat and quirky..very enjoyable. It may not be for everyone but you'll know right away if it's for you. The writing is so good. This isn't your ridiculous run-of-the-mill network comedy. You have met some of the characters before...self involved do-gooders, aged hippies, counter culture losers, the politically correct, protect the dogs but forget the people, people variously stuck in the 70s,80s and 90s all offbeat and most amusing. Portlandia will not appeal to people who enjoy: Jersey Shore, 2 1/2 Men, WWE. It may appeal to people who like: Walking Dead, Jericho, Breaking Bad. However, give it a go...you will know...""the dream of the 90s is alive in Portland"".",2012
8,"""Portlandia"" is a parody of/homage to the City of Roses, depicting scenarios that look like typical Portland occurrences. ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Fred Armisen and singer Carrie Brownstein play various characters that truly represent the city, with occasional guest stars. This is not a sitcom in the common sense. It's filmed on location, and the humor is sort of like the kind in Christopher Guest's movies. ""Portlandia"" isn't a masterpiece of a show, but it's a very fun look at my hometown. I can affirm that it's a pretty accurate portrayal. And a very funny one. This show probably won't be for everyone, but if you like quirky stuff then you'll probably enjoy it.",2012
6,"This show completely cracks me up. The strange characters portrayed by these talented people are too funny. The subtle humor and lack of a laugh track is something that is lacking on television. The mayor is a total pretentious jerk that probably reminds a lot of us of our bosses. The bizarre humor in the show is completely original and unrelenting. I hate it when they have back-to-back episodes on Saturday mornings because I can't get out of bed - can't turn it off. The bookstore women, the cult, the dumpster divers, the gender-reversed couple, the Portland ""Thinkers""....too funny. It's the best thing to hit television since ""Fernwood 2 Nite"", circa 1975. This just in...the second season sucked. I removed 4 stars.",2012
1,"I love dry, low key, intelligent humor. And this show advertises that this is what it delivers. Trouble is, this simply is a poorly thought out sketch comedy show that only pretends to deliver these things. It's not creative. It's not witty. It's simply a show that preys on stereotypes and relies on the counter-culture visibility of hippie and hipster culture to attempt to evoke a coolness factor that just falls flat in this show. And while Fred Armison is extremely talented, and I occasionally chuckled at his straight-faced deliver of some absurd line or facial emotion, it doesn't come close to making up for the boredom. ",2014
4,"The creators of this show made some accurate and pithy observations regarding the culture of Portland, Oregon, capturing our local native vibe that is sometimes quirky and sincere, sometimes obsessive, and sometimes down right passive-aggressive.

1,"One of those safe shows you hear everyone raving about. I gave this several chances, as I wondered what I was missing. All of the gags are DOA, I've never once even smirked at this safe pablum. I think the popularity of this God awful show is that everything safe, and all the humor, if you can call it that, is aimed at millennials. The jokes are based on observational humor specifically hipster culture in portland, which is just hipster culture. The problem is that all all the gags are nerfed, there isn't a single biting, or sharp observation in this show. Every single ""jab"" at these hipster conventions is gentle and designed for the hipsters to laugh at, because they are in on the joke. Also, all the targets are stereotypes so broad, this show needn't take place in Portland as all the jokes are totally generic, and run for far too long. This show feels like SNL - lame sketches that overstay their welcome. Jesus they did an ENTIRE episode about a bit where a lady didn't want to eat Tsukemen a certain way and the noodles came to life in a painfully tedious and unfunny episode length sketch that should have lasted 3 minutes at most. This show is just bizzzzaaaad.",2016
6,"I'm not from Portland, but I live there now. Portland is a beautiful place to live. Breathtaking scenery, an excellent public transit system, awesome restaurants, great beer and coffee, close proximity to mountains and the ocean. There's a lot to like about living here. Sure, it rains a lot, there are a lot of homeless people, and hipsters are pretentious douchebags, but most people are hard working, friendly and inclusive. Some people get annoyed by the ""small town"" locals and some people get annoyed by the ""yuppies for California."" I think most people are good people in this city. IFC plays on many of the Portland sensibilities in their satire sketch comedy show ""Portlandia"".",2017
3,"Portlandia is a version of anti-comedy that doesn't realize anti-comedy is only good about 1 out of 30 skits, not all of them. Anti-comedy is comedy that tries to be funny by not being funny or trying to be ironic and usually is not good. Sometimes the jokes are too front loaded, sometimes they are just flogged to death in the attempt of making something that isn't funny funny by repetition. So, basically this just didn't work for me. It might work for you; the closest thing off the top of my head is another show I didn't like: Curb Your Enthusiasm. I only watched one episode of Curb and only 3 of this so maybe it's not a good comparison.",2013

Armisen and Brownstein are a perfect duo who work well together and always manage to disappear fully into their characters. Whilst its not always laugh out loud funny (although I'm not sure that's exactly what they're aiming for anyway) I do always get a good giggle out of it. The show creates a wonderfully of-kilter world that is fun to dive in to for 20 minutes at a time, and immerse yourself in the little bubble that is Portlandia ! There's also some great cameos from stars such as Jeff Goldblum, Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader who always provide excellent comic relief, however Armisen and Brownstein do such a great job of pulling the show off on their own it's worth watching just to see them work together.",2015
2,"I didn't have the highest hopes for this show since SNL is not that funny anymore. But I gave it a shot. The first episode wasn't funny at all, which lead me to believe this show isn't a comedy. Is it? I mean, the beginning part with the singing was so long and not humorous. Then the characters were flat and in the bookstore, in took me awhile to realize Fred Armisen was playing a woman. See, if you watched a Kids in the Hall skit, you would instantly know a guy was playing a female. In this, I didn't. If there are jokes in this show, I must be missing them all. Wait, there are no jokes.",2011

The first thing you'll notice is ""Portlandia"" is really the ""Fred and Carrie show"". These two mesh though, so they can pull it off.

8,"As a resident of the Pacific Northwest, I am a first-hand witness of the culture that this show brilliantly satirizes. Although many of these characters are fictitious and exaggerated, there is an uncanny truth to it. There are two kinds of people who watch this; those who get it, and those who don't. You do not need to be from Portland (Oregon, because there will be an eternal confusion between the two coastal cities, it's just that Portland, Maine is not as unique enough to base a sketch comedy off of) you only need to understand that there is a throwback sub-culture that pays homage to those San Francisco 60's-70's era hippies that, have either migrated north, or had kids and they moved north to go to PSU, to take a class that requires a book ""The Vagina, An Owners Manual"" that might be sold at Women & Women First bookstore downtown ( As seen in the show). While jabbing at this Alternative lifestyle, the same self-righteous coffee shop patrons that take animal rights to a new height (with braised meatballs for the loner dog) they are, ultimately endearing and will grow on you. I see the satire and I see the comedy, perhaps others cannot differentiate the two, but there is a blend of comedy here that is original (besides the Ben Stiller/ Genine Garrafalo feel to it) that will transcend past the sour critics, who the show most likely undermines anyways, and will, at worst, have a cult-following of devout fans of Portlandia.",2012

8,"This show is incredibly funny. It is very dry, and there is no laugh track, so if you aren't into that type of humor/show, this isn't the show for you. They are particularly good at making fun of hipster overly sensitive liberal culture, while also making fun of the other side of the isle. There is something in each episode for every type of person. Sometimes, the humor isn't obvious. It isn't quotable. Its not something you can go tell your friends or share on twitter. A lot of it relies in the actual plot itself, or the subtle delivery from the actors. Sometimes it makes fun of movies, TV shows, or other traditional forms of entertainment. It doesn't stick to making fun of one type of person, and it doesn't stick to one type of humor. If you have a broad sense of humor or can at least appreciate their varying forms of humor, you'll love this show. If you only think very specific types of humor are funny, you won't like this. This show is brilliant, creative, and doesn't care about if it hurts your feelings.",2018

What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011.

Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.",2011
10,"Cars 2 is about Star race car Lightning McQueen and his pal Mater head overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix race. But the road to the championship becomes rocky as Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage. For Disney/Pixar this is much different compared to Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Cars, Up, Wall-E, Monsters INC., Ratatouille, Toy Story 2, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, And Toy Story 3. All have been Wonderful Films. Cars (2006) has been rated as the lowest rating of Pixar. But i thought it was wonderful. Cars 2 has the same formula. If you don't like Larry The Cable Guy, you will not enjoy this movie. He outshines Lightning McQueen, by being the main character. this film comes with my highest recommendation.",2011

10,"I'm finding myself very disappointed by the generally critics about ""Cars 2"", and I found the nucleus of the issue the fact that Pixar's latest movies have had a very philosophical idea floating around (Wall-e, Up, Toy Story 3) and the ""Cars"" franchise it's not about that.",2011

8,"I personally enjoyed the movie very much... It was full of action and had the same old Pixar humor. The only things that critics said that was seriously wrong with the movie was the fact that they build to much on Mater's character... Mater's character in the first one provided comic relief for the movie. In Cars 2, they made the comic relief the main character. The entire movie was based around Mater and that is what made it funny. But for some people there was to much of him and not enough of the original Lightning McQueen. This is a valid point, but it doesn't ruin the movie.. I would suggest watching it for sure!",2011

Yes it did have some funny moments but they were few and far between. The main problem with this movie however was that Pixar made Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, the main character. After 20 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave because of how annoying he was. Larry is annoying as a human, making him a the main character as a car is just stupid. It was honestly the only Pixar movie so far that I left feeling completely nothing. What a disappointment this was as this topped my summer movie list. What a disappointment...",2011

I mean seriously I don't care if mater is the main character nothing is wrong with it. even though it doesn't have emotional moments like the original its still insetting. the songs just feel nice to listen to its sounds nice.

6,"Cars 2 is the Pixar movie you think you hate but it is actually kind of okay. I wasn't ""very disappointed"" as a lot of other people were, but I wasn't amazed. The animation is great but the story was poor. It had all of this spy nonsense and Mater was the protagonist. That's what I didn't like about the movie. The Tokyo race was a lot of fun despite those ""crashes"" from the cars. I'll say that it was an ""average"" movie.",2017
7,"After rewatching this film, I honestly think it's pretty good. With a great voice cast, decent story flow, good premise, and amazing CGI, this proves once again that Pixar is king at what they're doing. The story itself however, is extremely flawed. The story, while it does go on a good flow, is sort of random and doesn't really have anything to do with what the first film was about. I mean, spies? Really? Not entirely sure why a movie about cars is spy themed, and frankly, it doesn't make much sense at all. But besides that, I honestly think this movie is very entertaining and fun to watch for all ages, as the story is actually well put together, making the film go on a good enough flow for it to be enjoyable, even if the whole concept of Cars being spies is random. While this film may not be one of Pixars best works, I honestly think it's not bad. I recommend this film to anyone who loves cars and spies, as this film has the best of both worlds. However, if you're a big fan of the first Cars film like myself, then be warned that this film is somewhat of a letdown compared to the first film. Despite all of the flaws, however, I was able to look past them and enjoy this film for the most part.",2017

Cars 2 is probably the worst reviewed animated film or sequel i have ever seen it got a 39% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.3 in IMDb and honestly i get it the movie does have flaws the humor doesn't always work the film even turns into horror at some point then goes back to humor, action, spy, drama and it mixes everything in a way that sometimes it works and others doesn't another bad thing is that the characters that everyone wanted to see from the first film have a 10 to 25 minutes of screen time and the new characters Holley Shiftwell and Finn McMissile were pretty good but the villains lacked originality they looked and sounded more like a 1966 campy Batman villain but instead of being a humans they were cars. But in the end Cars 2 is an entertaining sequel that is not as good as the first film but it's not bad either i hope tho Cars 3 is way better and closer to the 1st movie 8/10.",2016
1,"This is a terrible show. The acting is poor, plots are poor, and there isn't any consistency at all. Just take the basics - Jessie earns a living as a nanny to the three spoiled bratty kids these rich people have adopted to show how supportive they are of cultural diversity (a la Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt). However, they are left, most of the time, with Bertrum ( the butler) or completely by themselves; she rarely watches them at all.",2012
4,"On the surface, the concept of ""Jessie"" would be the promotion of acceptance of diversity and overcoming prejudice.

9,"So far I love this show! I used to like the Suite Life, but after its ending, I found this show was an even better replacement. So much better than awkward sitcoms from the past (such as Hannah Montana) and it is definitely geared for older teens since its main character is 18. Being 18 myself I find that the jokes are still G-rated, but just on the edge enough that young adults can fill in the blanks of the jokes (and they're actually funny believe it or not). I also think it is so much better than other sitcoms Disney channel is currently spewing out such as ""Mr.Young"" or ""Kickin' It"" as those shows are geared for preteens, have actors that are not very good, and they're not funny at all. If you're looking for the show that the Disney Channel should be clinging on to, it's Jessie. I hope it stays on air for a long time. Highly Recommended for pretty much all ages :)",2011
8,"Filled with magic and entertainment, Jessie is one of the better Disney shows currently airing. All of the actors/actresses are lovable and very talented. Debby Ryan does really well depicting a 18 year old nanny who is not only trying to figure her own life out but also teaching and influencing the Ross children. In addition, all of the characters are unique. Yes it is true that they seem to fill a stereotype. Zuri appears to be the sassy African American girl. Luke is the player boy who has bad hygiene. Emma is the ditsy blonde girl who seems only to be into fashion. Ravi is the typical Indian character with the accent. These are facts. But the way all of the character fit together makes the show great. As individuals, each are not interesting but together they create a situation that is both enchanting and enduring. The jokes are also humorous. As a person outside of the demographic I found that some of the jokes were for people of my age and other jokes were for kids. I think this is a good thing (to blend comedic elements). I have watched many Disney sitcoms and I firmly believe Jessie is one of the better ones.",2013
4,Jessie is one of those Disney shows that should not have lasted as long as it has. It's extremely unrealistic and while the kids are cute they need an attitude adjustment. This is exactly the type of show where children are learning bad manners and disrespect. They never seem to have that realisation moment that what they did was wrong. And the adults (including Jessie) are just as self-indulged and irresponsible as the kids.,2014

It was the first show on Disney Channel I enjoyed watching since The Suite Life on Deck, and I stopped enjoying watching that in February or March of 2010. Until about eight months ago, Jessie has never been my #1 show, though I didn't hate it like I did most other Disney shows back in the year it aired (with the only exception being Austin & Ally). Even though I'm a boy, since Emma and I are in the same grade, I can understand the problems she goes through in life. The acting from the kids is really good, and I like that they have Debby Ryan as practically a mentor for this show. I'm 17 now and the show recently started its last season, so thank you Jessie for helping me through my teenage years!",2015
9,"Jessie is much better that Good Luck Charlie, ICarly, Suite Life On Deck, Austin and Ally and Shake It Up. I can't believe some people actually dislike Jessie! Zuri is really cute and funny. But if Luke wouldn't over-react, and if Emma wouldn't rely on Leperd Beat Magazine, I would of rated this show 10. Otherwise Jessie is really good. 9 OUT 0F 10! I like Ravi because he is so enthusiastic. Bertrum makes me laugh because in one episode he said... ""Here we go, dinner is served. Frog legs with a bitter taste of worms. I'm only kidding, it's chicken... Maybe!"" He cracks me up! Ha! Jessie meeting Agatha really made the series much better. With Nanny Agatha in the series, it makes it funnier and more annoying. But annoying is what the watchers want... Isn't it? This is a reviewer commenting on Jessie, a new TV series on the Disney Channel!",2012
5,"When the Disney Studios decided to give Debby Ryan a lead in her own TV show after The Suite Life On Deck was canceled, why didn't they just make it official and have her continue with her character of Bailey Pickett now graduating high school at sea and coming to New York to seek fame and fortune?

Debby Ryan, Skai Jackson, Peyton List, Karan Brar, Cameron Boyce, and Kevin Chamberlin all did fantastic acting. All of these bad reviews are all full of lies. They probably haven't watched a whole episode, and watched a preview. Funny, thrilling, and more! Watch Disney Channels original show Jessie, with amazing acting, stories, and laughs! After all, the best actress/actor is Debby Ryan, and I'm not saying that because she is the main main character, but she is funny and caring to all of the people on set. Jessie everyone!",2012

Of all the shows of the Disney Channel, this is the best by far. It's smart, cheeky, and funny enough for parent who might be watching the show with their kids. It also gives its characters enough credit to allow them to be serious and to grow and change. This is a big step for Disney because so many of the characters in their TV programs are rather one-dimensional.",2012

3,"I have seen this show before, but I don't watch it on a regular basis, so a few days ago, I decided to sit through an entire episode, and honestly, it's not the acting that's the problem, it's some other things I'd like to mention; 1st of all, the humor isn't funny, and half the things the characters say are in all seriousness, but for some insane reason, the laugh track plays anyway. I mean, it's as if they want us to laugh at something, just to accompany the laugh track. 2nd of all, the characters of Ravi and Zuri are over-the-top, annoying, ghetto, and flat out weird, and the fact that the parents travel all the time(which is the reason for their usual absence from the show), and adopted 3 kids, after having only 1 biological child, shows that they're clearly knockoffs of Brangelina. 3rd of all, the theme song is absolutely horrible, repetitive, generic, and written on such an illiterate level, how can anyone enjoy this? It makes the Wizards of Waverly Place theme song sound like a masterpiece, and that's saying something because I absolutely hated that one. Finally, it was a poor decision on the part of Disney executives to give Debbie Ryan her own show, she's not lead star material, she was actually funny in the Suite Life on Deck, but here, it's as if she's trying too hard to be funny. That's all I really have to say about this, it's not very good, and if it were to stay on the network longer, it shouldn't go past 2 seasons. 3/10",2013
9,"""JESSIE,"" in my opinion, is an excellent Disney Channel show. I watch it with my 9-year-old nephew from time to time. I always smile and laugh whenever a mishap occurs. It's hard to say what the funniest one is. Another thing that makes this show funny is Trish's (Rani Rodriguez) comic relief. If you ask me, she always know just what to say and do to make the audience laugh. The writing is always strong, the performances are always good, and everything else about the show is good.Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that if you don't have basic cable, you should get it. Now, in conclusion, I hope this will be on Disney for many years yet.",2014
1,Can this even be considered a comedy? I was forced to watch this show with my little cousin. I thought maybe the Disney Channel had produced another magical show for young children to love! But boy was I wrong. Three words.... WORST SHOW EVER! Upon watching this I found myself literally falling asleep. Each joke's timing was off (If you even consider calling them jokes). Each one was awkward and I didn't once crack a smile the whole time watching this. The plots were really stupid and cliché. The characters are random and they don't work well together at all. I couldn't stand it! The acting was terrible and all over the place. Not even my 8 year old cousin liked it. She fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of the show. If this show fails to entertain the most easy to please 8 year old then who could it possibly bring joy to? I'm honestly really embarrassed for Disney. This show is putting Disney Channel to shame. I hate it. They can do 100 times better than this! I'd rather watch the paint dry on my wall. I won't be surprised if this show gets cancelled before the second season.,2011
1,"Disney has had some great shows . . . and some giant flops. This is the latter. It's poorly written with many re-used jokes that have been done over and over already, the timing is off, and they just aren't funny. The acting is mediocre, and some of the more ""serious"" lines had me laughing at the amateur delivery. The actress who plays Jessie is just annoying, and the rest of the characters just don't mesh. It feels like they're trying too hard to act, and it's not natural by any means. Unless it's the only channel you get, and it's the only show on at the time, you're going to want to skip this one. It's a bigger waste of time than trying to watch an Adam Sandler movie.",2011
7,"I watch this show with my kids (2 and 11) and they love it! The music is catchy and the characters are pretty funny. They are always in some kind of crazy mess only rich people can get into and their means of cleaning it up are entertaining as well. The only objection I have to this show is I don't like how Zuri is portrayed as being so ghetto. Wasn't she raised by her adoptive parents? Wouldn't she sound like the rest of the family? All that neck action and ""mmmm-hmmmms"" upset me. My kids are biracial and I don't need any help exposing them to these stereotypes. Most African Americans don't speak and behave in such a manner and I'm sure this particular young girl wouldn't being that she isn't around anyone who speaks or acts in that fashion. Otherwise the show is cute. Just thought I would throw that out there. Disney, if you see this review, please consider revising Zuri's attitude to reflect the life she lives on the show. I mean, China doesn't even act like that on Ant Farm so I really can't see where you are going with that character... Thanks.",2013

I couldn't believe how funny a kid's show was but I found myself watching a couple episodes until I gave in and looked for it on Netflix. As a 35 year old woman, I actually dig this show! Debby Ryan is so funny as Jessie. Sure, it is a bit unrealistic at times, but IT IS A KID'S SHOW for crying out loud. I doubt it will ever win an Emmy, but it is a funny, feel-good show that deserves a lot more recognition. I am so glad I discovered this show. America needs a lot more shows like this..on primetime TV instead of all the garbage thats out now. Less TEEN MOM and Honey Boo Boo and more JESSIE!",2015

I came here to look up some info on the show, and see all of these negative reviews, some of which seem to forget this is Disney, know what the target audience is, or don't even have facts about the characters straight, and I feel like I need to add my voice as someone who enjoys the show for what it is, and doesn't expect it to be more than that.

Jessie who continually puts the kids down and that leaves it open to the kids to do the same to each other. How Jessie puts her own needs over the kids and two parents who adopted all these kids and then basically ignores them. How the kids continually tease, pick-on and put down the butler and they do it for a bunch of cheap laughs. Can anyone say irresponsible I guess I wouldn't get so mad except right now Disney is pushing the anti bullying campaign and here they have a very mean little show. The scary part is how popular it is I guess the kids these days just prefer laughing at people being bullied to lifting them up to be the best they can be.",2014
6,"It's hard for anything to compare to John Carpenter's The Thing. It's one of the greatest horror films ever made, some would argue *the* best. Thankfully, they didn't go the remake route here and instead opted for a prequel that depicted the events that happened in the Norwegian camp prior to the '82 version. In that regard, this movie does an impressive job at tying some knots like showing how the two-faced thing came to be, as well as the origin of the dog from the start of Carpenter's Thing. Sadly, that's where most of the praise ends. ",2016
9,"This movie has been out for like 2 days and all I've read are reviews from those self-proclaimed ""loyal fans of the original"" (and by original, I don't mean ""The Thing From Another World"") that feel betrayed or disappointed or whatever. I myself happen to be a student of ""old-school"" horror and I am DEFINITELY a loyal fan of Carpenter's classic, and I thought that this movie held strong for itself. It's like all those people out there that complain that ""The Godfather Part 3"" was terrible, when in reality it was a good movie on its own. Compared to the rest of the series it was weak, but, like this movie, was good on its own. Yes, we get it. Its not the original. It doesn't keep the creature out of sight as much. Okay, get over it. Keeping the audience guessing was ""in"" in the late 70s/early 80s, and I loved that. Thats why it worked in ""The Thing"", ""Alien"", etc. But its 2011, and as much as I miss the suspense and guessing games of those times, we're in a new era where films sadly use more CG and flashy scenes than character development (by the way, where was the superb character development in the original? both films are HORROR movies about a group of people we know nothing about as we watch them try to survive. Did we really ever learn anything about Kurt Russell's family? or what Keith David's favorite football team was?) and good old Savini/Baker-esque special effects. But this movie, in my opinion, was made for those ""loyal fans"" that,while watching the first film, were saying ""Wow, I'd love to know what happened at this Norwegian camp before Kurt Russell got here!"" And it did just that. It led right up to the events of the first film, while telling a separate, while similar, interesting story. It explained minute details from the first film that we were left wondering about. It recreated the Norwegian camp as viewed in the first film. It did everything in its power to remain true to the first film, while also giving us a reason to pay and see a NEW MOVIE. In our day and age, where it seems like every other horror movie that comes out is a remake of a classic from years ago (due to lack of original ideas?), its nice to see a prequel instead of a remake. Its nice to see a movie that tries to tell an original story, while keeping just enough elements in there to hook loyal fans of the original film. If you're going to the theater to watch Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (which it seems like all these 'loyal fans of the original' were expecting, though I don't know why...), then don't see it. If you loved Carpenter's film and want to see a fun N-E-W story that perhaps answers some questions you've wanted answered, then see this. Remember, its not Carpenter's film and its not trying to be. Its another movie, just giving a bit of an homage to Carpenter's classic.",2011
5,"In 1982 John Carpenter released his groundbreaking sci-fi horror masterpiece, The Thing. It involved a group of scientists in Antarctica who must divert from their research to deal with a mysterious creature that has infiltrated their research center. It's a creature that kills off people and then copies them perfectly so as to blend in with everyone else before they attack again. The creature came from another research camp located miles from their own, a desolate and abandoned Norwegian camp. What exactly happened in that doomed research facility has long been a mystery. All we know is that it was a disaster and it where the entire problem began. 2011's The Thing attempts to resolve that mystery by telling the back story of the events which led up to John Carpenter's film. However, in its attempt to fill the gaps and resolve the ambiguities this version of The Thing, to put it bluntly, does a very poor job.",2011

8,"When it was announced that this was going into production, there was a level of confusion/curiosity regarding what exactly it would be: remake/reboot/sequel/prequel? Also, would it utilize prosthetic effects like the 1982 original, or would it go all out CGI splatter? As it turns out, it's a combination of the former and the latter. The new 'The Thing' wants to have its cake and eat it too: you see, technically, it's a prequel but for some reason, the makers have molded it as kind of a remake as well. That's both clever and rather infuriating in equal measures. With regards to the effects, yes, they are CGI for the most part, but they look practical and are done well.",2011

",2011
7,"What really made John Carpenter's The Thing so magical was not its sci- fi elements, its alien movie aspects or even, I daresay, its splendid 1980s animatronic gore. It was the psychological tension! The issue of trust was a horrifying prospect: Who can you trust? Are you who you say you are? How can I tell what you say is the truth? At any moment, someone could be an alien waiting for the opportune moment to burst out and consume the vulnerable person. As a prequel to John Carpenter's work, The Thing (2011) taps respectfully into this raw suspense from the start, but towards the end loses its direction and falls victim to the Hollywood clichés of a typical alien monster film.

I was looking forward to the Norwegian prequel as I love Ronald D Moore's version of Battlestar Galactica and thought he would really nail this as well if he wrote the screenplay. I first saw The Thing on VHS at the age of 16 over 20 years after it originally was released in theatres. What I loved about the film was the tension created based on the characters' paranoia of not knowing who to really trust to be a human. It was this quality that I believe made the film as compelling as it was. The monster effects were very impressive for their time, but for me they came secondary to the paranoia aspect of the film.",2011
9,"This film is awesome...it brings back good old fashioned horror and suspense.John Carpenter should be proud.Director,Henninggen pays homage to Carpenter without replicating the original films essence but bringing something new yet familiar. The performances are strong and Winstead solidifies her legendary status in fan boy and geek worlds by continually picking projects that showcase her talent while not compromising her integrity.Edgerton has been on a streak with another fantastic performance.Beltrami's score is nostalgic while refreshing.This film is a perfect companion piece to Carpenter's film.Solid filmmaking!",2011
1,"Whoever made this movie didn't understand what was great about John Carpenter's 1982 version. The Thing was terrifying because there was TENSION. There is no tension in this ""prequel."" The creature does not attempt to ""hide inside an imitation,"" it tries to kill everyone in it's proximity without ever being threatened or exposed. This movie contradicts or screws up everything we knew of this timeframe (what took place at the Norwegian camp) from the original movie. Yes, some bodies and objects end up in the same place we saw them in 1982, but other MAJOR events are completely altered. There is nothing worse than making a movie under the title or license of an established classic, and butchering it into a paint by number of Hollywood clichés.",2011
1,"There are too many major story discontinuities in this film with relation to the 1982 version, and that is unacceptable, especially when the director supposedly had ""millions"" of screen-shots from the Carpenter movie to work with. Some of the scenes that really tie in the movie to Carpenter's version came as an afterthought AFTER the credits began to roll at the end. That made it seem cheap and amateurish, like the director and producer didn't really care. Something about the whole film made it seem sloppy. It's hard to put a finger on it but it just didn't come together very well.",2011
10,"and make this a perfect trilogy, let it pick up from where the 1982 film ended. I have wanted to see a part two for the longest time. But John Carpenter has to do it. And it has to be just as awesome as this movie is.",2012
4,"So they remade The Thing oh okay, but wait it's not a remake it's a prequel, there was little to no difference. Comparring the cgi effects to those classic Carpenter effects is unthinkable, but I have to say it, the cgi is garbage, a step back if you will. I didn't fell any suspense, which is unfortunate, and a bad job done by the director.",2012
1,"And this is suppose to be a prequel? The Thing is a slap in the face to John Carpenter and the original Thing from 1982. First time director, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., does a terrible job with giving The Thing that horror movie feel. The point of horror films is to scare your audience. The Thing has zero scares and is just a mess of visual effects. The script for this film is trash. If you're going to write a prequel, write an actual prequel! Give a back story to how the thing got there, don't just write new characters and throw in a spaceship. This is just garbage. The CGI in The Thing is hard to watch because it looks like you're watching Dead Space video game graphics. I really don't like how fake everything looks.The performances in The Thing are just as bad as the story, but what do you expect, right? This film has a random cast and it's funny how cheesy the line delivery is by everyone. The Thing is by far one of the worst horror films and a sorry excuse for a prequel.",2012
6,"Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community . The producers convinced Universal Studios to allow them to create a prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing instead of a remake, as they felt Carpenter's film was already perfect . Directed by Dutch Matthijs van Heijningen in his first film , the thriller is produced by Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman (Dawn of the Dead). However, the prequel still has the title of the original film, because they couldn't think of a subtitle that sounded good . It is set in Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists . It deals with a lonely group of scientists (Ulrich Thomsen as Dr. Sander Halvorson , Eric Christian Olsen as Adam Finch , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Derek Jameson) who take on the most dangerous creature of universe. The shape-shifting creature , accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing , paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead and in order to not try to compete with Kurt Russell's portrayal of the 1982 film's protagonist, R.J. MacReady, the character of Kate Lloyd was designed to have traits in common with the character Ellen Ripley from the Alien film series) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime and she is studying a thawing cave bear (Ursus Spelaeus). Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew's pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish. ",2012
7,"I'm surprised there haven't been more than three versions of this one, The Thing From Another World is up there with Dracula and Frankenstein in terms of quality. John Carpenter's 1982 version, however, was so pitch-perfect, and so close to pre-CG special effects perfection, that it seemed like you just couldn't top it! A new take on a classic tale for a new audience is always welcome in my book, though, provided they capture what made the previous version(s) special.",2012
1,"I don't understand this prequel at all. The producers stated that John Carpenter's original film was ""perfect"" hence their decision to make a prequel instead of a remake. But in making this prequel they have completely changed the entire premise of the original film, which is, in my opinion, subtlety, fear, mistrust, suspicion and a good use of the ol' fashioned ""whodunnit"" storyline. Kim Paffenroth sums up the fear of zombie movies really well, and I think it applies equally as well to the original The Thing: The suspense comes more from how the human characters interact. The movie has the suspense, paranoia, and claustrophobia of a movie about a siege, or a lifeboat full of survivors with limited supplies: the besieging army or the sea is a ""given"" and is not really the enemy, the real enemy is within the group, with the fear and ignorance that tears them apart and sets them against one another. Whereas the 2011 film seems only interested in trying to shock audiences, showing many graphic alien morphing scenes, and yet, none of them are nearly as frightening, gory, realistic or affecting as its 20-year-old predecessor. For scientist most of the people are complete idiots, and not in the entertaining ""don't go in there"" kind of way, but more in the face palming kind of way. Been a huge fan of the original, I really didn't enjoy this movie and I knew that I wouldn't. Honestly, it's really not worth a watch. Stick to Carpenter's original.",2012
1,This film is dreadful.,2012
10,"As a Deaf woman who rarely watches any television shows, because CC is not always accurate, and it gets tiring trying to figure out what is being said in English, I have to applaud the writers and producers of this show. Thank you for *finally* bringing a show to television that incorporates the 3rd largest language in Canada (behind English and French) and 3rd largest language in America (behind English and Spanish) into a television show.",2012
8,"When I saw the first commercial for this show, my interest was piqued. I admit it, I've always been interested in this type of storyline. not exactly ""feel good"" subjects, but fascinating nonetheless. But then I remembered the network this show is on. It's not bad in and of itself, but when I look at The Secret Life of the American Teenager -- another show I thought had an intriguing plot but was ruined quickly with horrible acting and unrealistic story lines -- and I got a little bit leery. ",2011
10,"This TV series shows promise. The actors are fine and the character development and premise of the story is quite involving. If the writers consistently produce solid scripts and story arcs, this show should do well. The idea of the switched at birth formula mixed with the prince and the pauper fable (and the deaf girl embellishment) makes for a rather refreshing plot backdrop. With this set up, they can go anywhere and everywhere with it. Also, there are many details that can make for interesting plot situations, ethnic and cultural diversity, economic class disparity, family situations (one doesn't have a father, the other has a grandmother), so many different things that the writers can play off of. It's good that neither of the two girls are super famous actresses. It would take away attention from the story. The writers have also avoided falling into the stereotypical cliché of everything involved with race and economic diversity. It would be great if the show concentrates on the human drama and that it stays away from politically correct preaching. On the whole, the show does indeed show promise.",2011
10,"I rarely begin to follow a television show while it is in its first season for fear that it will be canceled. Yet this one drew me in and I cannot get enough of it. The idea of being switched at birth is so bizarre, and the dynamics of both families are so real. The raw emotion and feelings portrayed by these characters makes me feel sorry for and sometimes resent them all at the same time. The drama always keeps me eager to see what will happen on the next episode. The writers may have struck gold with this one.",2011
8,I had a bias the Switched would be like the other ABCfam TV shows... dull and boring with reeeeaaally bad acting and unrealistic plot lines.,2012
2,"I had high hopes for this show when it first started. For the first couple of seasons it was interesting and I thought they handled the deaf thing very well. It didn't feel preachy and was a natural part of the show. I thought it was a nice touch that when the deaf people were ""talking"", most of the background sounds were muted (and the background music was stopped). It really helped to see the scene from the ""deaf"" perspective.",2015
10,"I'm not a fan of much family TV series. But this took me off the habit. It's one of the best series I have ever watched. Story is centered round two kids whose Switched at birth (Just as the Title suggest). One of them been Def take us all to a whole new society which we are yet to shed some light and discover. How they handle the hardships thrown on them by the ""Hearing"" - Society and so on. Whole story-line is so flawless and It will grab your interest from the 1st episode. It's really depressing that they take so much time to complete this season but it's really worth the wait. Hope I will see more of this in upcoming years and hope that it will never loose its present quality!",2012
10,"This is one of the finest show I have ever seen. Really! It is heartwarming, funny, empathic, sweet and simply beautiful. I adore it, and I adore the people in it. The characters are great, the plot is great and the acting is even greater. You will get impressed! ",2011
9,"Not only is Switched at Birth (one of) the best family show out there right now, but it's also easily one of the best standalone shows. The concept of the hearing world clashing with the deaf/non-hearing world is truly original and riveting. After the premise, I knew the show had great potential to captivate/hook viewers, but then again it could be disappointing if they wasted such a great concept by taking wrong turns. And fortunately enough, I was taken by surprise.",2011
9,This is probably the most meaningful of the ABC family shows. Pretty Little Liars is entertaining but shallower by comparison.,2012
8,"I liked this after the first five minutes. A very well executed, and very well played out series. Every one of the characters can act very well, and the emotions are so real, and I'm so drawn to the show. I make time to watch it every week. I will more than likely be a fan of the show for as long as it lasts. The actress who plays Daphne, is AMAZING. She is not really deaf in real life, but she is so convincing, and I actually forget that she is just an actress. Honestly, this is the most realistic show that ABC Family has ever made. It's funny, sweet, and really raises awareness to what deaf kids in America really go through. I really underestimated all of the abilities that deaf kids have. But, this show has opened my eyes, and it is pure, great entertainment, and I know I will always be a fan.",2011
3,It's sugar sweet and so unrealistic. This is a pity as the basic idea of two babies swapped at birth by a hospital error has actually happened.,2015
7,"The thing that attracted me to this show was, of course, the title. ""Pretty original"" I thought. As far as I knew, no one else had ever tried to tackle such a profound subject. And yes, the subject is profound. Think about it. What if that happened to you? However, I was troubled when I heard the show was one of the many new shows that ABC Family was adding to their list. Why was I troubled? Because the day before, I had experienced the horror that is Cyberbully. But that's another story, and another review. But, I pushed through my doubts, and watched the pilot of Switched at Birth.",2011
2,"There was so much potential for this show, dealing with the two girls and family realizing that they were switched at birth. On top of the fact, dealing with the different social-economic status, and one of the girls are deaf. Now they are going down a slippery slope that they cannot go back and fix. It has turned into a typical teen drama that focus on loose morals, that has the teen do selfish things, where they do not have to truly deal with consequences of their actions. This show is like many newer shows centered around teens, and does not teach them anything truly moral. I just cannot get into this show anymore, it used to be as I stated about family, and is too much about teens doing selfish spoiled things, that most teens would not do, and if they did would not get away with it. Yes they add in the family eventually dealing with the issues from the mess that the teens got them into. I really dislike how most shows now are showing how loose morals are ""correct"" morals. What happened to shows to being about family, rather than about drama to be interesting. I guess I am outdated soul, which in my opinion this world and writer of TV shows needs.",2015
8,"A great family drama about two families that get extremely close fast, after finding out their two daughters were switched at birth. There are so many themes happening and being played out well. Being switched at birth, how each person feels. The daughters want to get to know the new mothers and see how they could have grown up, the parents want to scope each other out, blame each other and themselves. The first two series mainly focus on the switch and the identity crises that this causes the two girls. I began watching for this but I stayed for the deaf scenes.",2013
1,"It starts really good and has twists and turn that keep you coming back. The hearing impaired characters add a lot to the show and they do a nice job of addressing different issues regarding the hearing impaired. So why the bad review? Because it shoves a liberal and unethical lifestyles down your throat. How many different people can the teens and different characters sleep with? If they meet them, you can bet that in no time at all they are going to sleep with them. Everyone in the show cheats on everyone else. And parenting... ""Oh, my seventeen-year-old teen is going out, so my big question, ""Are you using protection? Okay, good."" Are you kidding me! There is so much more and so many more liberal issues that are pushed on you that it gets too much to tolerate. It is a shame because the characters, and acting is good, but by the third season I just couldn't stomach it any longer. Finally, life is hard enough, I want to sit down and watch a show to relax, this is one downer of an episode after another. If you want to be left feeling bad after watching a show, this is the one for you.",2016
7,"After watching Switched at Birth since the start, I have come to realize that the series is more about being deaf in America, than being, well, switched at birth. And I really like that. More shows should explore what most people consider just a way to cope with a handicap, but what actually is its own culture and a beautiful form of expression. After reading the reviews and comments, I've come to understand that I am not the only one actually learning a bit of sign language, simply from checking out a cute and entertaining family show.",2013
6,I've been taking ASL for awhile. The deaf community and the ability to communicate with your hands is so amazing. And now finally a show that uses that without over doing anything. Its the perfect mix of signing and voicing. I'm glued to the TV and am like a little kid with a book. I stay up all night watching it and screaming at the TV. About it. Its addicting and fun to watch. Although sometimes you can see some stuff happening from a mile away. Just wanna say I miss wilkie with my heart! Bring him back!!!!!!!!! He made the show a 10.! I love how they have a realistic plot and the acting is superb. I've noticed that the characters seem to grow and change and the director seems to embrace that rather than hide it unlike in some movies/ shows where they cover up that extra winkle or the weight gain or the grey hairs. This director shows it and it makes you feel more connected to the characters and helps you feel like the story is moving along. Can't for the next episode.,2013
4,"From the first episode the deaf angle felt fresh. After that fades you're left with exactly what you expect from ABC family. I'm almost done with season 4 but I mentally checked out halfway through 3. The show has become extremely PC. It's predictable to the core. Someone finds out something and they eventually spill their guts for the sake of drama. You get a lot of ""protect you"" lines. I am absolutely sick of people being ""protected"". If you like to see people blowing things out of proportion this would be a good show for you.",2017
10,"I saw the preview, and I must admit that I was afraid that this would be another messed up teen drama show.(too many on TV as it is) I'm glad I was wrong. After seeing a couple of episodes this quickly became my favorite show. It is now #1 on my priority list, on my DVR.",2011
1,"This series is very one sided. Very stereotypical, but so fake at the same time. I have grown very tired of this show. I have been watching it since it started and it used to be different and it had an interesting story line. But now it has turned into a teen soap opera like every other show - promiscuous sex. Too bad. The writers have ruined characters and made the good ones into bad ones. It is too unfortunate that TV has to be all about sluts and crime. I think the writers are grabbing for anything they can to keep this bomb alive. Nothing good here.... After this last episode I have had enough. I will no longer be watching this show. It is a waste of time.",2015
1,"Worst show ever, both girls are , horrible human beings, so irresponsible , criminals, whores, total losers. Everyone in the show are total hypocrites , no one has any solid values that they actually believe in and stand by, very fake characters.",2015
7,"Switched At Birth is a fairly good show with a great concept that has been fairly well executed but there is just something that makes me not love this show. There is so much going on with the hospital switch, new boyfriends every week, friend drama, sport drama, parental drama, rebelling drama mixed in with occasional sign language use and honestly I am exhausted. It's so hard to focus on the storyline as it seems to change every week. Sometimes the storyline doesn't have a chance to be explored properly as they are on to the next idea.",2014
6,"I started watching this with my wife and thought it was a pretty good show. However by the end of the series, I was disgusted on how they portrayed immorality as being an everyday OK thing. Between underage drinking, partying, sex relations and breaking the law on many occasions, I feel this show really should be rated MA. While no nudity or actually intimacy is shown, the rest of the content is NOT for any one under 17. It sends THE WRONG message to teens and younger ones. No spoilers in this review, just the truth. What are we really teaching our kids? Underage party drinking, sex outside marriage let alone underage and vandalism is OK in this world? By the 3rd season it really takes a turn, and my biggest shock was how the parents handled it, that is the message that is wrong.",2015

However, if you like to go to the movies just to break the routine, to have some laughs, and to change your mind, this is an excellent movie. Most highly critical people looking for perfection will give this movie a bad review, no doubt. People who gave an 8 to True Grit will not appreciate this movie...",2011
6,"Adam Sandler is getting pretty solid at producing and acting in quasi-poignant tales that get him somewhat further away - and, ultimately, closer to (doesn't make sense, I know) - from his proto-Sandler-style of filmmaking that has his vaguely proto-typical cast of characters - hapless, hopeless geeks, improbable ladies' man, a ""nice guy"" that all the ladies want, but still seem to settle on the douches. Sandler brings his ""crew"" together - former/current SNLers, Allen Covert (who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of), and some heavy-hitters occasionally. ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Grown-Ups,"" and, now, ""Just Go With It"" all pander to this amiable style of film-making that is at times borderline gross-out - but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatow-slacker movie, nor is attempting to be.",2011
8,My wife and I watched this movie on Valentines Day. The way we decided on this movie was that we watched trailers for all the movies in our theater and this one stood out by far as the best.,2011
10,"If you're looking for a good laugh, I highly recommend this movie. You'll definitely enjoy it with your friends or your family. If I want to watch a comedy, I'm not critical about anything, if the movie can make me laugh then I'm good. I know what I was expecting when I went to see this movie but I wasn't expecting that it was going to make me laugh that hard!",2011
2,"This is a horrible movie that actually made me laugh a bunch of times but that still doesn't save it from my rating. The laughs have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are mostly sight gags. The entire premise is absurd, instead of telling the truth to the new girl he met about wearing a wedding ring he concocts a lie so complicated and stupid it could never work under any circumstances. One point being the idea that he is automatically going to stay with this girl even though they only had one night together but still creates situations that would not work in any future with her. His fake wife is really his assistant, his cousin has to do a fake German accent and his fake daughter has to continue to do a English Cockney accent forever?",2011
4,"""Just Go with It"" is a 5-year-old comedy that got featured (like most of Sandler's works) at the Razzie Awards as well as several awards shows for younger audiences. It is the American approach to an originally Indian film. The director is Dennis Dugan and I cannot say I am too familiar with him. Same goes for all the writers working on this one. Always a bit disappointing if there are so many and the outcome is still a letdown. Sandler may not be the most talented actor, but he does a decent job in picking roles and that's why the character here fits him nicely once again. Aniston also has more pros than cons. Sadly, I cannot say the same about Brookly Decker, who just is not a particularly gifted actress and at times it felt she was only in her to show us her great swimsuit body. At least the Andy Roddick cameo was funny at the end. And then there is Nicole Kidman, who seems stupid and unlikeable for all her early scenes and then somehow out of nowhere gets some depth and emotion added to her character. That was embarrassing. It was so obvious that they only included her final scene because it was Nicole Kidman playing the character. Cringeworthy stuff. I would feel sorry for her because of how low she has sunk, but then I remember she has won an Oscar and is a truly mediocre actress, always has been and I don't feel sorry for her anymore.",2016
4,"Just Go With It sits in the middle of the best and worst Adam Sandler films this side of the millennium. Many, considerable pitfalls exists. Sandler piles on the lies to get his girl. Firstly, pretending to have an ex-wife (Jennifer Aniston), because Sandler gets caught wearing his old wedding ring that scores him many girls (in his dreams). Secondly, having two children when he has none. Thirdly, his cousin Nick Swardson enters the fray, pretending to be Aniston's new German backpacker boyfriend. The lies are awful and flimsy. The charade's kept up for the entire movie. It'd be convincing if Sandler was only trying to get his leg over. Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. She's the good in a jumble of mess. This film is aptly named, as if it's telling us just to go with it too.",2015
1,"So a film about a plastic surgeon who makes fun of his patients, lies to girls to get them in bed and multiple ""boobie"" jokes- that's right it's an Adam Sandler movie. He plays the same girl chasing immature character in every movie, except with a different job and name. He even makes the same silly voices, e.g. when he says, ""My Precious"".",2013
1,"There isn't much to be said. Brooklyn Decker is nice looking but that's about the only redeeming feature of this movie which is the worst I've seen in a long time. Some poor casting and worse writing makes this one close to unbearable. You know right from the opening scenes that you're going to be in for a long night. Jennifer Anniston proves once again that she is one dimensional and the rest of the cast isn't much different. I did enjoy however the scenes with Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews because at least if was something a little different. Save yourself the time and the money, because let's face it - one way or another, you've seen this movie before.",2011
1,"This terrible remake of I.A.L. Diamond's work on Cactus Flower back in 1969, itself based on an excellent stage play, was difficult to sit through: Too long, too unfunny, and to formulaic. Relying on sight gags and stale jokes cannot save a bad film, much less a screenplay that probably required very little effort on the part of the writers. Of late, much of what's coming out of Hollywood reeks of paranoia. When one is afraid to take a risk, in the genre of romantic comedies, remake something that was successful years ago. This travesty is indicative such a mentality. Also, when will Jennifer A. wake up and stop getting herself involved in films that will do little for her career? Save your money and rent Cactus Flower. Trust me, you'll be happy you did.",2011

1,"Why do people always say ""I just want to be entertained"" when talking about a horrible movie? As if anything that isn't completely moronic couldn't possibly be entertaining. This movie didn't have a single shred of honesty or humanity. The plot seemed to come directly from some Microsoft program that creates boilerplate scenarios for lame romantic comedies. And why does every movie have to be about rich creeps? I'm certainly no Bolshevik but I am thoroughly sick of watching movies about people who live in mansions and spend $1,000 on a single pair of shoes. When was the last time you saw a movie about someone who had a normal job?",2011
1,"Whilst I wouldn't regard myself as a Sandler fan, I've watched most of his films over the years, and some are even excellent to barely acceptable - a fairly good record considering the amount he has put out since he started. Just Go With It, well, I won't mince my words is just atrociously bad - badly acted, badly directed, badly scripted. In fact I would go far as to say this was my razzie awards film of the year. I guess the clue was already in the title, possibly pleading fans for patience whilst watching it. Sorry Adam & Jennifer, this was sheer self- indulgent dribble, poor and very weak. How the hell Nicole Kidman got caught up in his script, beggars belief or any decision of good common sense. Was she forcibly made to do this? I see no other reason for her wanting this role. The script is so full of utter implausibilities, so stupidly riddled with holes, (not at all funny as Sandler can be), I felt insulted, violated, when watching this film, squandering 2 precious hours of my life which could have been occupied with much anything else - that's how meaningless of any entertainment value I think this piece of utter junk is worth.",2011
1,I had the misfortune of sitting through this movie with an elderly patient and his wife. NO ONE laughed much in the entire theater.,2011
2,"Seriously, this movie was ridiculous from the very beginning. Sandler and Aniston were bad caricatures of a plastic surgeon and his compassion less assistant, Brooklyn Decker came across as the world's stupidest school teacher and worst of all was Nick Swordson's rendition of Jerry Lewis' Mad Professor. The kids (although cute) weren't even likable and as their mother, JA showed all the warmth and maternal instincts of a Madame Tussaud figure. On the bright side for Aniston, her bikini body was way hotter than Deckers. The only bright spot was Nicole Kidman's conniving character. I can only assume that a lost wager on Kidman's part accounted for her appearance in this charade of a movie. If that's the case, she's probably sworn off betting forever. So sorry I added to the week's coffers. It's not even worth the price of a rental.",2011
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know how they got Kidman or Aniston to do this film! Especially when you compare it with some of the amazing comedies these actresses have been in. I love most Aniston films but I couldn't sit through this.It lacked her witty humour and the edge she and Kidman usually bring. ,2011
1,"The Adam Sandler days are over. I thought Grown Ups would of been the end of it but he had to make this piece of crap too. Sandler continues to come across as a fat, arrogant, rich Jew who doesn't give a crap about anything which probably isn't too far from who he is in real life. I hate to be so hard on him because Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were gold. But this movie is just a major waist of time. Even the gratuitous shots of Any Roddick's wife weren't enough to carry even the slightest interest in the plot. Throw in the one dimensional Aniston and Dave Mathew's first acting appearance ever, and you've got a sleeper. If you want to still think highly of Sandler, don't watch this and put Billy Madison back in the VCR instead.",2011
1,"Initially when i was watching this movie, had great hopes on it. And slowly in my mind i started predicting what happens next. with little insight in my head i realized ... hey the movie is copied from some dumb Bollywood movie. now can u beat that. i thought Bollywood is suppose to have this kind of business line. and the worst thing is they didn't change anything. really a disappointment on that part with the lost of originality. the flow of the movie is good and ya it is funny at times. but i couldn't help my self but rate this movie 1 because of the fact that the story line is not original.

3,Jim Carter wrote the following review which was published in an Italian newspaper in April 2011:,2011
1,"God awful. I would appreciate it if the film industry didn't capitulate to the demand for horrendous endeavours such as this one. This ""movie"" makes Matthew McConaughey look like Daniel Day Lewis, and Fool's Gold like Citizen Kane. Overall, I am hard pressed to blame Hollywood and the screen play writers for producing this farce of a plot, as the people inexplicably yearn for such cringe worthy clichés and egregious character development, and back stories. The much lauded and acclaimed acting performances of Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston culminate in this 'piece de resistance', unlikely to be bettered this millennia. Good luck at the Academy Awards, as a Best Screenplay and Best Actor reward are positively assured.",2012
10,"In a world filled with mindlessly violent movies and flimsy plots with practically nothing to substantiate the actions of the characters, I went into this movie looking for mindless violence and girls-with-guns escaping reality and an asylum and not much more.",2011
9,"Nearly every review you read for this film will say the same thing, it's a 'love or hate' movie, and there's a very good reason for this. ""Sucker Punch"" is not the film you were expecting, whatever that might have been, particularly if you were expecting a hyper-masculine affair a la ""300"". If anything it is hyper-feminine; at its core this is a movie about women struggling against the evil male influences in their lives. That doesn't mean it isn't loaded with action - it really is, and it is beautiful, but if you're looking for an easy watch, this isn't for you. In terms of sheer originality, this movies narrative style is right up there with classics like Pulp Fiction and Memento, but there is a downside to this - you need to keep an open mind. If you can't watch this movie, at least once without - and this may sound weird, but you'll get what I mean when you watch it - demanding to know exactly what is going on, right the hell now, it will lose you, and it won't get you back. But if you can keep an open mind, right till the end, at the very least it will give you a lot to think about",2011
10,"Here's the thing about this movie, its demanding. You have to be able to let go, realize that it's stylized after a modern comic book (of the adult genre), and just go with the movie. Let it take you on its ride, which is a beautiful/wonderful thing.",2011
10,"After absorbing myself in the world of Zach Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" for a while, including one viewing at IMAX, one in my local theater, and multiple listens to the soundtrack, I felt the unusual calling to dump my thoughts out regarding this haunting, beautiful, polarizing, and brilliant film.",2011
8,I originally wrote a review the day after I saw Sucker Punch. I panned it. To me my initial feelings were rather lukewarm at best. ,2011
8,"I personally enjoyed the film and I am a fan of Zack Snyder's previous films (Watchmen,300,and Dawn of the Dead). The visuals were pretty much stunning with very few exceptions, but they are easily forgiven and not distracting at all. The acting wasn't anything ""Oscar"" worthy, but then again it shouldn't be. The performances were very good for an action film and I like it that way. This films definitely attracts the teenage male demographics, who like action packed films filled with hot women. This film, however is not for everyone. Some people might not like CGI, some women might be offended that this film is very shallow, violent, and very degrading towards women.This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.",2011
10,"Sucker Punch is totally out there, and probably the only way to combine so many different things in a single story.",2013
9,"I recently saw Sucker Punch at an advance screening and thoroughly enjoyed it. To be honest, I am the target demographic here. I'm a guy in his twenties who plays video games and enjoys fantasy movies and action.... but this is a decent film overall. It appeals to my ""sensible adult"" side that appreciates a good, well written film, with great directing, great acting, and overall good cinematography. It also appeals to my ""twenty-something male"" side that loves sexy ladies, guns, killer robots, dragons, samurai and swordplay. The abundant CG is stunningly beautiful and doesn't feel overdone or become visually exhausting like some movies. This movie gets me. and I know that there will be a good number of people who dislike this movie, dismissing it as juvenile, or stupid. who dislike the amount of CGI used in this movie. I don't care... I love this movie for exactly what it is... a good movie that appeals to me in every way.",2011
8,"""Sucker Punch,"" the latest barrage on the senses from writer-director Zack Snyder (""300"", ""Watchmen"") is his first film that's based on his own source material. And it proves to be quite stunning definition of pop filmmaking. In a triumphant marriage of style and tone, Snyder has created his own ""Kill Bill"" by going deep down into the rabbit hole. A glorious pastiche of colour, CGI and kinesis, ""Sucker Punch"" even through its obvious flaws, has set a new bar for graphic storytelling that attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen.",2011
4,"With 300, Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes, indeed they do, but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface, but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.",2011
8,"I have been absolutely pumped for this movie since I first saw the trailer for it last summer. I'm fresh from viewing it, and I have to say that it's not quite what I expected, though not necessarily in a bad way. To those who haven't seen it, two words: Do it. But be open to the fact that it will almost certainly not be exactly what you expect. Although it looks like a somewhat mindless kick ass, eye candy flick, don't be fooled: there is a pretty good story here, and its deeper than your first impression of it will be, also. Oh, and don't try and predict the ending.",2011
5,SPOILERS AHEAD!,2011
5,"This is by far, Zack Snyder's worst movie until present time. However, it is still a ravishing visual spectacle, guided by a magnificent feminine bombshell cast and accompanied by an electrically dynamic soundtrack.",2011
1,"This film could not be more appropriately titled. I was a ""sucker"" to pay good money to see this slop, and I felt like ""punching"" writer/producer/director Zach Snyder for putting me (and many others) through it.",2011
1,"I'm not sure how this movie got such rave reviews by some people, oh wait yes I can, the ONLY people who can possibly like this film are fantasy/anime/comic book junkies!",2011
2,"A crime against the cinema. It's too bad. I honestly have enjoyed Zack Snyder's films in the past, besides that crappy owl movie he made last year. I'd classify them more as guilty pleasures than actual good movies, but I found them entertaining and neat to look at. Sucker Punch, though, combines all his worst traits and adds a script that he himself wrote (along with co-writer Steve Shibuya). His previous films were all adaptations, three of picture books and one a remake of a George A. Romero classic. He didn't have to think much himself to make those neat images. Sucker Punch demonstrates that he just doesn't have the ability to think of things himself. It's a movie that combines mental hospitals, burlesque shows, giant samurai warriors, half-mechanical zombie-Nazis, mech suits, orcs, dragons, killer robots, and atomic bombs, pretty much every cool thing one can think of.",2011
1,I'm sick and tired of wasting my time watching garbage because of reviewers on IMDb have gone soft... ,2011
4,"Even with millions of bullets flying through the air, dozens of swords swinging & the hundreds of punches these hotties take, not one of these girls ever gets a single scratch during the battles. After the first brawl pitting the Girls Club against steam-powered Germans & ferocious shooting planes it's so painfully obvious that none of the girls will be in any real danger that the big budget special effects are just fluff & overkill. What's the point of all the bullets & bad guys if the chicks are indestructible? By the second battle it's just so irritating watching these females punch, kick, shoot, jump & slice their way through crowds of bad guys when they could have just walked & not gotten hurt. The story is clever but watching chicks that fight again & again & can't possibly be defeated is not one-tenth as interesting as watching people who can actually die in battle.",2011
1,"I could have walked out of this movie after the first 5 minutes and not missed a thing. You know when you go to a movie and you can tell within the first few seconds whether or not it's going to be a good movie? Well, I got that feeling that it wasn't going to be any good and to my suspected notion, it wasn't. ",2011
9,I will try to avoid spoilers and simply give some depth to reviews I have read so far. But I will check the spoiler box just in case.,2016
9,I attended the midnight showing of the film last night and here are my two cents:,2011
1,"A lot can be said about this film, but only when accompanied by clenched fists and a look of bewilderment. Wooden acting, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, boring and repetitive action sequences, a plot which is predictable in it's journey to no-where, a lack of meta-story, a horrible degradation of well-loved songs, evidently bad editing (which is a rare one)... All contributing to a pile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother going to the cinema. This film characterizes everything that is wrong with modern cinema, emphasizing looks above content and a type of 'stylised' filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common sense. Don't see this film, unless you enjoy developing an aversion of movies.",2011
3,"I would only recommend this movie to my friends that play Warhammer 40K because the only kick I got out of the movie was the references to units in the ""dreams."" I can sum up everything good about this movie in two points:",2011
10,"There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.",2011
9,"Woody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds its finality with ""Midnight in Paris,"" the latest of Allen's Parisian brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in a way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point of ""Midnight in Paris"" is that we've all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed. If anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.",2011
8,"""Do you think it's possible to love two women at the same time?,"" asks our protagonist Gil Prender to a tour guide discussed Auguste Rodin's love for his mistress and his wife. Like that's the first time we've heard that question in a Woody Allen movie. Infidelity, gorgeous women, and neuroticism are some of Allen's favorite motifs, so it's really not too much of a surprise that they all appear in Midnight in Paris.",2011
10,"Woody Allen's latest is beautifully written and a charming story that belongs in the top ten of his all-time greats. From the opening montage of lush, picturesque Parisian scenes the film is a love letter to the city of lights. Owen Wilson is perfectly cast as Gil Pender a Hollywood writer who has penned his first novel about a man who owns a nostalgia shop. Throughout his stay in Paris he hearkens back to the iconic characters who once roamed its winding cobblestone streets.",2011
8,"The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. ""Midnight in Paris"" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen Wilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful, normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close up, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too. Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali, played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.",2011
10,"I loved this movie! It blends film noir with Stardust Memories, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and a bit of Annie Hall. The scenes of Paris were enough to make one fall in love. The music was superb! Having all the artists and writers show up was the ultimate name dropping contest! Their caricatures were hysterical! Casting Adrien Brody as Salvatore Dali was mind blowing, along with the surreal discussion about a rhino. ",2011
8,"Quite a lot of great lines carrying life's wisdom; Profound reflection and insight of living the precious present expressed in a light-hearted touch! If you have your own 'Golden Age' fantasy, you will likely enjoy it. This movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in communicating its message than some of Allen's other works, such as ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."" As a plus, lovely cinematography of the city of Paris - Mr. Allen has apparently fallen in love with the 'good old (and charming)' European major cities; e.g., London, Paris, Barcelona and etc. Very likely, you will leave the movie theater with a big and warm smile on your face...",2011
9,"Midnight in Paris is a subtle romantic drama with a comical touch that has a little bit of almost everything: be it magic-realism, romance, phantasm, voyeur, surrealism or even noir. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to proclaim that everything that Woody Allen learned and gained during his long stint in cinema culminated in form of Midnight in Paris – An ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past. Driven by the very impetus that gives cinema its resonant charm, Woody Allen the auteur has seen his art go from strength to strength, taking new shapes and forms, being completely oblivious of the existence of his larger than life alter ego, Woody Allen the showman, whose stimulating works have been a treat for us all for last so many decades, and who himself has been a force to reckon with, right throughout his long and illustrious career that still seems to be in its prime.",2013
3,"While I'm sure some moviegoers did find this film enchanting, I think the greater majority of critics and viewers who claim it's a masterpiece are just afraid to admit that a film that name-drops so many intellectuals is just not very good. For a film whose list of characters includes some of the greatest minds of the early twentieth century, ""Midnight in Paris"" has little to say about the creative process or inspiration.",2011
9,"Woody Allen takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the while making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great cinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen's trademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar character types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Odd man out is Owen Wilson, but somehow he sheds his B-movie past and encompasses the Woody Allen humor without mimicking Allen. The ever-evolving plot twists will have you laughing as well as entranced. This is the first Allen film (in a long time) where he doesn't pontificate about life and death, but only celebrates the present while ironically, living in two eras. This is beyond Oscar material.",2011
10,"It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".",2011
4,"After an interminable opening montage of establishing tourist shots of Paris (if it had been London there would have been red phone boxes and double decker buses; not a North African mugger or traffic gridlock in sight), all to the accompaniment of Woody Allen's horn-blowing, we have Woody Allen directing a Woody Allen script in which Owen Wilson plays a writer of scripts who talks, acts and dresses like Woody Allen; after half an hour or so of by-the-numbers comic clichés about culturally insensitive Americans and pompous pseudo-intellectuals (oh the irony!) the plot stumbles into Goodnight Sweetheart territory as Woody, sorry Owen, stumbles through a time porthole into a 1920s Paris where you cannot order a coffee without Salvador Dali asking ""Have you met my friends Luis Bunuel and Man Ray?"" Just when you think it cannot get any crasser Woody, er Owen, er Woody, trowels on a Hallmark moral about living in the present before ditching his materialistic American girlfriend to take up with a French chick who shares his love of walking in the rain...",2011
10,"I love Woody Allen, so already I'm biased. But even I will admit that he's been spotty for the last...my God!...twenty years or so. ""Curse Of The Jade Scorpion"" will forever be his lowest moment, and in his later phase ""Match Point"" and ""Vickie Christina Barcelona"" remain the highlights. Well, we can add another to that list. By no means is this movie an ""Annie Hall"" or a ""Manhattan"", let alone a ""Husbands and Wives"". But if you've been bored by what you've been seeing at the Multiplexes lately, if you think ""The Hang-Over 2"" sucked and you've despaired that the romantic comedy is dead...than I'm delighted to tell you to go see this movie right now. See it on a big screen! It's gorgeous to look at, fun to watch, romantic, sweet, smart, and pleasantly old-fashioned. This movie is not a masterpiece, and yet I'm giving it 10/10 because it was perfect for what it was -- a modest pleasure that left me in a great mood, and even a little inspired.",2011
4,"I am astounded that this film is amongst the Oscar nominees for 2012. If there was a category for Best Travel Film it would win hands down as the cinematography is first class in its depiction of Paris. But the plot is so shallow as to be transparent. The characters are likewise and define the term cliché. Owen Wilsons whiney portrayal of what is clearly supposed to be Woody Allen himself is irritating in the extreme, except when he puts Michael Sheens character in his place with a critique of a Picasso painting, which I admit was the highlight of the film. I am aware of Allens politics but surely he is more intelligent than hitting us over the head with his obscenely wealthy American 'sledgehammer' of a Republican family. The film is worth the nomination for Art Direction but the other three nominations are undeserved and to think that this sorry apology of a film has been nominated for best film when Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been overlooked is nothing short of scandalous. If you want some good shots of Paris see the film otherwise pass it by.",2012
1,"This is Woody Allen at his most shallow and pretentious. As in all his movies, the central character is Woody Allen himself, his anxieties, his narcissism and his affectations. Whether he plays the main character himself or, as in this case, it is played by someone else, it's still the whiny, insecure, pathetic little pseudo-intellectual that by all indications is who he really is. All other characters in his movies are either clones of the Woody character or projections of his neuroses. What's most evident here is Woody's tin ear for comedy. Jokes fall flat, and worse, ruin any semblance of a mood or serious emotion among the characters. Woody is, and probably will always be, a frightened, insecure twelve year old boy with average intelligence who is desperate to appear smarter than he is. For some people that's funny; for me, it's just embarrassing.",2012
10,"Woody Allen seems to be in his element after a long long while...a well deserved pause and I must say what an intellectual pause eh! A fabulous screenplay,the most original I have encountered till to date. Shooting Paris la' Manhattan was anticipated but execution is unpretentious...a difficult task in this age of high end computer graphics tantalizingly at your beck and call. Casting of '1920s Greats' was to the ""T"". 'Rhinoceros' Dali is the manifestation of wicked wicked Allen and you can imagine the understated 'throat clearing' pause from Woody whilst writing and filming 'Rhinoceros' scenes..",2012
10,"As embarrassed as I am to say this, this is the first Woody Allen movie I have ever viewed. I have heard numerous amounts of good things about his work and his directing, and his originality. I never really had an interest in seeing this movie when it came to theaters, despite all of the positive comments about the movie, but when it was nominated for Best Picture I immediately added it to my Netflix list. I wasn't sure what to expect, but, I knew it was Woody Allen so I was pretty excited to view this movie, even though I had no idea what the movie was about. Boy, I was pleasantly surprised.",2012
10,For any senior creative person trying to keep dry eyes during Midnight in Paris is almost an impossibility. It brings back faint memories and romantic desires wished for but often unfulfilled.,2012
1,Shallow and cliché'd this movie made me pine for a 'Kung Fu Panda 2' showing next door for a more meaningful experience.,2011
3,"Usually Woody Allen movies maintain certain artistic level: acting, humor, avoiding cliché, music, etc. Usually Woody Allen movies are made for intelligent viewers, with intelligent viewer in mind. Unfortunately Midnight in Paris is not one of such films.",2011
4,"In an interview with L.A. Weekly, Woody Allen said, ""The human predicament is so tragic and so awful that, short of an act of magic, we're doomed."" Given his questionable view of the human condition, one wonders what the word ""magic"" means to him. There is little indication of it in his latest film, Midnight in Paris, a love letter to an imagined Paris in the 1920s. Set to the music of Sidney Bechet, the film opens with a 3 1/2 minute montage of Paris by cinematographer Darius Khondji's that is little more than a travelogue showing the usual tourist sights rather than the true Paris beyond the Eiffel Tower and the five-star hotels that Mr. Allen seems so enamored with - street vendors, bookshops, cheese, bread, wine, and pastry shops, outdoor cafés on the Left Bank, and quaint streets loaded with charm - the Paris of the Parisians.",2011
9,"This is easily one of my favorites! I love this movie to death, it's funny, insightful, passionate, meaningful, romantic. The directing is glorious, considering how flashy and dumb it could have been, Woody Allen makes this story seem so real and it comes so naturally. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the score is absolutely wonderful. You can just tell how much everyone working on this project was passionate about it and wanted to make it the best it could be. All the performances were astounding, and ensemble cast with not one standing out as an actor during the experience and easily Owen Wilson's best performance in my opinion. This film is so different and original and it plays it off so normal. There is a reason the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The dialogue was excellent, feeling very real and as if characters were actually just people talking. The film inspires me as an artist, it really tries to be art and about art. But more than that: it is about love, understanding, dreams, our past and so much more! This film is so quirky but so beautiful at the same time. It is something that I would suggest anyone watch because my god is this film amazing!",2015

The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake and Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make Chicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it feels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this film delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly recommended.",2011

It's a unique kind of movie that intrigues the whole cinema and let us enjoy the ride in a new way.",2011
9,I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller I've seen in years. ,2011
10,"What a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to the point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time getting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are there, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and an end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time telling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that keeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code' which is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels short, it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good thing? Shows how good this film was!",2011
8,"Source code is one of those few action/sci-Fi movies that work effectively without exaggeration or embellishment. When we see Source Code we see the certain resemblance it has with ''Déjà Vu'' with Denzel Washington but Duncan Jones, with his own talent his own style prevent that from happening. Source Code has is own method and approach, which is quite entertaining and enjoyable. This movie is certainly recommended for all the action-junkies because this has all to be a ''Summer Hit'' which confuses me, why hasn't this opened in June or July, it had the potential and the content of an ''Summer'' blockbuster. Jake Gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero, since but he really pulls everything off really well. Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent. On the whole Source Code is pure entertainment at its best.",2011

9,"When i saw this at a preview screening, i was not surprised to find another great film from one of the best sci-fi directors of our time; Duncan Jones, who brought us the instant classic, Moon. Source Code is in part an original movie but bears brief resemblance to Tony Scott's Action/Thriller Deja Vu. Source Code centers itself around Colter Stevens, an AFO soldier who wakes upon a train, not knowing how he got there or why and how people are addressing him as someone else, and soon enough the train explodes, supposedly killing everyone. But Stevens awakes to find himself in a kind of ""machine"" called the Source Code.",2011
8,Source Code is the 2nd feature film from English Director Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie). Duncan has showed audiences twice now that his narrative can be told boldly without excessive explosions and unnecessary cgi by exploring an idea and the implications it entails; which is what should be the basis of any story.,2011

2,OK so Gyllenhal is good in this movie. Lets get that out of the way first. Now onto the roast.,2011
9,"At first I was expecting the source code to be a mediocre mystery that was all about reviving a dead girl. However, this was not the case at all in this movie, which was a welcome change. The Source code was a thriller that was constantly moving, constantly generating questions, and keeping the movie interesting. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the variety of traits the main character, Gylenhall, shows in the movie who has a strong sense of justice, duty, honor, and love. Unlike some movies, the main character is not an idiot pilot, and has considerable knowledge of a variety of topics, one being quantum theory. Another positive quality of this movie, is how each visit in the source code continues to build up to the climax of the movie. The constant search for new pieces of evidence is also intertwined with constant character development of the protagonist allowing you to get a better attachment to the character. Another thing I found fun was each time he came out of the code, the character and story development continue to take place, again driving the action. Now let's talk about some weaknesses of the movie: One big thing is the protagonist seems to be too perfect, his collective traits of knowing advanced quantum theory make him a little unbelievable. A second thing is the explanation and ending may be too complicated or too unreal for some audience members, though I did enjoy the ending that took place. The third flaw has been present ever since the trailer came out in which the person who bombed the train is also planning to make another attack. As a result, this automatically narrows the suspects on the train. If you keep thinking during the movie then you can figure out who it is within probably two or three visits to the code. Regardless of the weaknesses, the thought, development, and constant pace are more than enough to keep you entertained and happy. At the same time it also has some good morals built in about finding true happiness and working through the negatives of the world. Thus overall I would give this movie an 8.5-9 on my scale. I hope you enjoy as well.",2011
10,"Oh, how we all love us some good old fashioned Contained Action- Thrillers! Last year we got the dreadful but noteworthy ""Unstoppable"" - in which our two heroes stationed themselves inside a moving train in an attempt to stop an unmanned freight train heading toward a city.

1,"Source Code has a powerful trailer, setting up some intriguing questions to be answered and hinting at three plots: inside the virtual reality, outside it, and an interplay between these two that should solve some crucial points. Unfortunately, the film itself contains absolutely nothing that isn't already in the trailer. I saw the film with my wife. She fell asleep in the middle, woke up half an hour later and asked me ""was he on the train again?"" to which I answered ""several times"". ""What did I miss?"" ""Absolutely nothing."" The whole movie is an exercise in wasting time by a screen-writer whose ideas ran out shortly after he thought up a great trailer (read: sales pitch. I can almost hear it: ""Inception meets Groundhog Day, and all happening entirely inside the Inner Space capsule!"". Unfortunately, other than recycling from the exceedingly overdone ""virtual reality"" movie genre, this film has nothing). There is only one plot: ""whodunit?"", and that plot progresses nowhere, and is finished when the question is answered by the first candidate the audience suspects, but the last the protagonist bothers checking. The ending of the movie, on the other hand, is so bad I dare not even blame the poor screenwriter. It must have been the work of a focus group. Whatever its source, it is lame and unconvincing. Do not expect any of the questions posed by the trailer to be answered. They are not.",2011

1,"This movie shamelessly uses computer science (specifically computer programming) jargon (about 5-10 terms, like ""specification"", ""drivers"", ""Source Code"", etc) for a completely different purpose. For the kind of arrogant bullshit this movie presents (which is NOT science fiction, it's the new genre: bullshit fiction) it should be banned for reasons of subculture and attacking the sanctity of computer science, the most advanced and helpfull science we've got, the pinacle of civilization.",2011
6,"Not sure what other people are seeing in this. Within 10 minutes I had the plot worked out. I very much disliked the cinematography. From the first scene with the cut aerial shots sweeping to the train and over the city I did not like it. The relationship between the girl on the train and the man was ridiculous. He had more on screen time and a better relationship with the military girl. I just thought it was not very good, boring shots very like good TV, very little drama. I do not understand the people on the edge of there seats comments. A 6 film, not awful but it felt like payola to me. The studio must be delighted to have somehow gotten away with it.",2011

7,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Brady Bunch, this isn't. It's also not the place to look for helpful parenting tips. In fact, the story revolves around Eva, a woman (Tilda Swinton) who apparently didn't want to have a child ... at least not at this time, and certainly not THIS child. If you have seen The Omen, you probably gave thanks that you didn't have a child like Damien. At least we knew Damien was the spawn of Satan. Eva's son Kevin, is instead a good old fashioned psychopath. One who has an inherent need to cause pain and misery for his mother.",2012
9,"We need to talk about Kevin is easily one of the most harrowing films I've ever seen and left me completely empty. Lynne Ramsey succeeds where so many others dealing with a similar subject matter have failed, as she abstains from sensationalism and bloody detail. Instead she focuses in on character and relationship development and breakdown.",2011
9,"I saw this film at Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) prior to its general release. This is not a film I would choose to see normally, based on its subject matter. However, as a festival-goer, this was what was offered for the late evening screening. This film is visually stunning, and masterfully composed. You know early-on that a Columbine-style ending is inevitable, nonetheless hope that some miracle may yet occur to avert this disaster. Swinton is absolutely magnificent (as always) as the mother desperately trying to cope with raising a psychopathic child, but equally impressive are the performances of the actors who portray the developmental stages of Kevin from early childhood to the brink of adulthood. What elevates this film is the visual and musical narrative that accompanies the initial time-skipping introduction and then the more linear progression of Kevin's growth to its final, terrible conclusion. Interestingly, the emotional crescendo of the film occurs not near the end when Kevin carries out his horrific violence, but rather in the middle of the film at moments when we observe the impossibility of living a ""normal"" family life with a child who is incapable of feeling or expressing the human emotions that bind us together.",2011
9,"This is quite simply one of the best films of the year. Even the book's author, Lionel Shriver (a woman) praises the film, calling it 'a brilliant adaptation'. Being a first-time dad, the story fascinated me. What happens if you don't love your own child... and they know it? ",2011
2,"I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it, and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies, right? The subject sounded fascinating: parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story, and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that, properly told, should bring tears to any parent's eye.",2012

10,"After watching this film twice in two days I can honestly say it is among the most affecting and gripping movies I have ever seen. The use of sound and the wonderful camera work made my hair stand on end. I enjoyed it even more the second time as I was able to make sense of the opening scenes without straining myself, this however is not a criticism; rather it is a testament to the intellect and emotional power of a film where every member of cast and crew excel themselves. Sadness, joy, pain, nostalgia, elation and confusion are just a fraction of the feelings this roller-coaster provokes, and the audience's sheer awe was summed up by the 10 seconds of breathless silence as the screen faded into credits before an eruption of applause broke out.......Astounding.",2011
4,"They certainly did need to talk about Kevin. I'm fine with difficult subject matter and ambiguous storytelling. But this film just seemed lazy in its search for answers. Tilda Swinton plays a mother that is haunted by something in her past. Her son is in jail, the whole town hates her, and her husband is no longer around. No prizes for guessing what is going on here. She tries to live a normal life but the town just wont forget the past. She looks at her past to see how her son turned into such a monster. The film angered me by dong nothing of note. Swinton is a terrible mother, as she never seeks help for her son. I've seen kids misbehave, but this film takes it so far. It comes across as some cheap Hollywood horror film. There is no way a sane woman wouldn't reach out or get out. Even when her daughter's safety is put at risk, she does nothing. Then we have Reilly as the father. He believes nothing his wife says, which makes me question why they are married in the first place. Even when Kevin acts out in front of him he he does nothing. Swinton also lives in the worst town in the world. The people are so horrid, you'd probably want to massacre their offspring yourself. I understand the anger, but this entire town is filled with vicious human beings. I was able to connect with one character in this entire film, the boy in the wheelchair. Other than that, you have a film of unbelievable, stupid, and cruel people. The acting is great, and it's shot beautifully. I've already read up about the book which seems more cohesive, and the narrative obviously works better than it does in this film.",2012
1,"I love thrillers, psycho-thrillers, especially if there is originality and they can surprise me. This movie didn't in any way. The mix of present and past just makes the movie unbearable boring. There are no real surprises at all. After the first 20 minutes it was perfectly clear what would happen/has happened. Then the situations with mother and young Kevin are just ridiculous. I'm working with children (and have experience with more than ""difficult"" ones): I don't expect a movie to be authentic in any way, but Kevin's behaviour is just cliché, nothing more, there is no deeper personality, it's just black and white. Summing up the content, I would say: the movie has no point at all, there is absolutely no tension, the people harassing the mother after the killing: pure nonsense. None of the characters is more than one-dimensional, this movie doesn't work in any way. At least this is my opinion and I wouldn't have written a review, if there wasn't this incredibly high amount of stars, something I don't understand in any way. Yes and I know giving one star seems to be just an angry reaction, but that's not true, I would even give this movie zero or minus stars, if possible: Because in relation to the money spent on it, the usually pretty talented actors (in other movies) etc. wasted on this piece of crap - sorry, but I think, there is not a better fitting expression -, this movie is beyond any proportionality.",2014
7,"While the idea behind ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is exceptional, I was put off by the direction of this film. While I know that a non-linear way of film making is popular these days, it's often overused--and here it is not used effectively. Too many times, the film jumps about in time and this took me out of the experience. This makes the film too unnecessarily confusing--so I am glad that I knew the plot so I could understand what was happening. Additionally, the film used a very deliberate artsy style--such as the overuse of the color red (the tomato fight, the stack of tomato soup cans, the paint)--resulting in sledgehammer symbolism. For me, the story was very strong on its own and didn't need all these tricks.",2012
8,"We Need to Talk About Kevin is certainly a movie that will be every  parent and would-be parent's worst nightmare. This movie gained a lot  of praise at the Cannes Film Festival and attempts to explore the  themes of society, parenting and psychology.  Eva Khachaturian (Tilda Swinton) is a middle-aged mother hated by her  community and struggling with the aftermath of a tragedy. Her  sociopathic teenage son, Kevin (Ezra Miller), has committed a school  massacre and she has to deal with the results of the sins of her child  and explore how Kevin turned out this way in a dual narrative.  After being unable to make her version of The Lovely Bones, Lynne  Ramsey turned to adapting this Lionel Shriver novel instead. She  delivers a haunting, slow-moving film that looks at the personal and  social impact of the tragedy through one person's eyes as well looking  at the struggles of raising a troubled child. Ramsey made sure there  was a grim, somber tone and kept a minimalist view of the world, yet  still adds her own visual flair with intense, slow close ups and red  imagery throughout the film to symbolise blood on Eva's hands.  There is a deliberately disjointed narrative throughout the movie,  cutting from the present to the past as we examine Eva's inability to  bond with her son. Ramsey took the bold step to avoid showing any of  the actual massacre and most violence is committed off screen. We do  not need to see it to understand its impact on people. Nor did we see  Kevin's preparations for the massacre: We Need to Talk About Kevin is  Eva's story, not Kevin's.  But there is a major problem with Ramsay's approach to the story: she  seems to ignore the entire concept of nature vs. nurture. Eva being  portrayed as a bad mother is outweighed by the way Kevin is shown as  practically the product of Satan's loins. Throughout the film, Kevin is  always pushing his mother's buttons and made out to be evil from the  day he is born. There is no subtlety in his portrayal, even with basic  things like reaction shots. We Need to Talk About Kevin should have  been more ambiguous, because the whole point of the film is to raise a  debate. The audience is not meant to have a clear answer.  Swinton's performance was highly praised and she is worthy of an Oscar  nomination as her character Eva, who starts off both as a woman at a  real low end and her struggles with a child she does not want. She is a  disaster of a mum to Kevin as a young child, a child who tests her  patience. Swinton was able to bring real depth to her character. When  she does make the effort, the damage is already done. Throughout the  movie, Swinton plays a tragic and lonely figure who is isolated in some  form, a character who is a shell of her former self.  Kevin is strongly played by two actors: Jasper Newell plays Kevin as a  little brat, pushing his mother with his behaviour and playing Eva and  his father (John C. Reilly) against each other. As a teenager, Erza  Miller portrays Kevin with a sociopathic and nihilist outlook. He has a  sharp mind, but enjoys inflicting pain on others, including his little  sister (wonderfully played by the young Ashley Gerasimovich). He is a  character who believes in nothing and takes a destructive path as a  sinister air is always around him.  Reilly plays Franklin as a normal suburban dad, someone who wants to do  the right thing for his children. It was a wonderfully natural  performance of a man who just sees Kevin's behaviour as being typically  boyish. He is very deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod for such a  believable performance.  There is a permanent, chilling sense throughout the film thanks  Ramsay's low key direction and the power of the performance. This is a  film that should stick in your head, but We Need to Talk About Kevin  should not have been so clear-cut.",2011
6,"But, she never did it, nor did the clueless father. I immensely disliked the film's subject matter and the stupidity of its main characters, and that made it a slow and aggravating slog for me to get through it, even as I realized that the filmmaker had to strongly provoke us to convey her true message with the intensity it deserved.

8,"'We need to talk about Kevin' is a tale of guilt, grief and shame of a mother (Tilda Swinton) whose son Kevin (Rock Duer, Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller) has committed an atrocious massacre at his school. Based on the acclaimed novel by Lionel Shriver (2003) and directed by Lyne Ramsey who has been missing from the movie horizon of recent years, a powerful and excellently constructed piece of cinema is upon us.",2011
8,"In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: 'It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:",2012
5,"Much of this movie version of Lionel Shriver's ""We Need to Talk about Kevin"" just doesn't live up to the impact of the novel. I found the first half boring, the stylized mini-flashbacks annoying. The music selections seemed inappropriate and odd, some too-loud country-western (?) stuff played over too many scenes of the mom driving. Lots of Tilda Swinton (mom) looking shell-shocked. Completely awful miscasting of that goofy-looking John C. Reilly as the dad, even if he did act his part well enough. The young actor who plays Kevin as a teenager is very handsome, with striking almond-shaped eyes, as if he had an Asian grandparent--he looks nothing like either of his ostensible parents. The second half picked up a bit, but they left out the scene where Kevin tells his dad what he really thinks of him, a significant breech. The end fell flatter than in the novel. Sadly disappointing.",2012
1,"All you people are nuts...this movie was freaking terrible. What an awful waste of time Her shots were self indulgent The story was so frustrating to follow It made no sense None of this would have happened this way. Kids aren't born evil. No parent would let their kid get away with the things they did. The father would have picked up on the tendencies. Don't WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! AWFUL TERRIBLE NO GOOD DISGUSTING it Sucked. Tilda Swinton was decent but she was given very little to act. It was a bunch of concepts of what a lost helpless mother should look like. How about his teachers and other people who would have picked up on his sociopathic behavior. Don't waste your time with this crap movie. Overly wannabe artistic garbage, self indulgent BS!",2012

The beginning is so silent and confusing, your not sure whats really going on (the tomato scene??) Talk about drawing out the story. Don't get me wrong the acting in it is really good but thats about it. Its so drawn out and unclear as to whats happened, if I had my way I would have just turned it off halfway. It obvious the kid isn't normal but they don't actually show him doing anything really disturbing..the drain cleaner incident and missing guinea pig incidents are very unclear and don't even get me started on the fact that people in the town hate her...he also killed her daughter and child - how could anyone hate her? It makes no sense. Stupid, boring confusing drawn out film I wished I never watched it. Thank you and goodnight.",2012

2,"This is probably one of the worst adaptations of a book since 'I, Robot'. However, 'I, Robot' could at least kind of be enjoyed as a film. If you've read the book you will be awfully disappointed. The way this movie was approached completely ignores the emotional complexity of the characters and just has long frames and sequences of pretentious symbolism shoved down your throat ad nauseam in its place. Yes we get it, she's trying to wash the paint/blood/guilt off her hands. Eva is just presented as an emotional wreck with none of the strong, intelligent insight as her paperback counter part. Teenage Kevin is overdone. I actually found kid Kevin to be pretty good. None of the true motivations behind people's actions are explored. For example, a significant part of the book is about the (bad) reasons why Eva and Franklin decide to have a baby, this is then built on later when it turns out Kevin is not quite right as a child and into his teens. The timeline in unnecessarily befuddled. Worst of all, the most cinematic scene in the book (the revelation at the end) is completely mishandled, given away too early and fizzled out in a short frame. Very disappointing - if you haven't already, go read the book, you'll not only understand this better but it is also a fantastic read from an extremely intelligent and articulate author.",2012

We SO wanted to leave but didn't want to waste our money really - we had our popcorn we needed to eat too haha.. It was slow, incredibly boring and really strangely hysterical to watch Tilda just constantly staring catatonically into the camera lens - (so close you can see her pores) as he film maker aimlessly walks around backwards camera poised.. There's no connection to be found with the characters and it switches you off right from the start in the random tomato fight! What a joke..

The convoluted plot and mish mash of devices (the red paint, the random guy in a wheelchair, the tomato wrestling at the beginning, the dead father and daughter at the end, the obfuscation over how the daughter loses her eye) detract from the story progression and from the intense Swinton and the unsettling Ezra, who made the film worthwhile to sit through (I nearly walked out, that tedious was the first half).",2011
10,"Seriously the best TV show in a very long time. The whole office thing isn't very original but this show is still fresh and hilarious every episode. I made an IMDb account just to write this review and to mark that other dudes review as unhelpful! I can't wait to watch the rest of these episodes, I have literally watched the first episode four times and I just watched the third one and it blew my mind. Just talking about this show makes me laugh. If somebody told me that this show was a copy of the office I would say that they were probably on shrooms when they watched it because it is ten times better than office! Not that there is anything wrong with the office. The office is probably my fifth favorite show, but Workaholics is by far my number one!",2011
10,"Funny, Irreverent, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Workaholics is the type of show that you need to watch multiple times to get all of the jokes. It is sneaky smart, in that it seems dumb as hell at first, but the more you watch it the more you understand how smart these guys are. The later episodes haven't been as good as they have gotten further away from the office drop-back, however the writing remains sharp and it's obvious the guys don't give a f*ck, which makes it hard to critique them too harshly. Overall, it is a relaxing piece of humor that is easy to share a beer and a laugh with over and over. Thankk gawd CC picked up a 4th and 5th season.",2013
9,"This show is hilarious. The Office, Entourage and 30 Rock have all jumped the shark, and I thought Sunny was getting close until last season, which was stronger than the previous. A few years ago, I found television to be ripe with great comedies, but just recently I was noticing that Curb and Sunny were about the only two that I found hilarious on a consistent basis. But Workaholics surprised me, it really seemed to come out of nowhere. And I'm so glad to hear that they are already writing for season 2. Awesome news.",2011

Along with the other reviewer, I signed up at IMDb here specifically to dispute the review shown on the front page, what do the Brits know about humor anyway? This show is definitely geared toward working class stoners of which there are certainly no shortage. Put your preconceptions aside and just enjoy the senseless humor that this group offers in every episode. Part of why this show is so appealing to me is because I have been in this exact same position, working as a telemarketer, getting stoned everyday, living with a bunch of crazy roommates. This is a comedy show that stays true to real life situations that real people go through and puts a humorous spin on life and friendship. If you don't think the poop dollar is hilarious, you should rethink what you find funny.",2011

(like when they're wondering how they're going to get clean urine when everyone their age smokes pot. Word, right?) It's refreshing, constantly funny and well-acted. With three slackers as the main characters, it's nice to see each one slack in their own style, be it uptight, mellow or on the edge. (ders, blake and adam). I'd have to agree with other reviewers that I hope Adam tones down the funny-cuz-im-loud aspect. He does it well, and it's usually funny, but it won't be quickly. I get the fratboy lifestyle mocking though.",2011
9,"Like most new comedies it took me an episode or two to really get into this although I did like it enough from the first episode to watch more. Like most half hour comedies as the characters develop it gets better and better but where so many new comedies seem to fall down this one doesn't. The show doesn't focus too much on character development which allows the jokes to flow freely and fools you in to developing an interest in the characters, like a good comedy should. I probably enjoy it a little more than some might because Anders, that is Ders with a 'Hard-An' reminds me of a friend of mine at work.",2011
7,"I have to applaud Comedy Central, not because this show is particularly great but rather because they put shows like this on the air. It's not as funny as Man Bites Dog, Halfway House, Issues, etc but it is still funny and worth watching. By Comedy Central putting on shows like this, funny people out there actually have an obtainable goal if they want to have a go at getting a show made. Had BBC3 not aired The Office perhaps Ricky Gervais would be a plumber instead of a comedian. I guess my point is that this show isn't paint by the numbers, slick camera shots and laugh tracks. It's one of those shows that takes elements of guys you know and amps them up. Not quite to pro wrestling levels but probably a bit higher than you'd see in real life. It's fun though and you won't walk away feeling as if someone just insulted your intelligence. You never know, one of these young guys could end up being the next big funny man. Lay off the network shows for a week and check this show out.",2011

You take 3 goofballs who like to make bad puns, pump themselves up, and not take life very seriously and you've got a great show. Jillian is hilarious how tough she is and how shes like one of the guys. The 90s references are spot on from hip hop catch phrases, old rap lines, video games, tmnt they are spot on. I hope this show is on the air for many years. There's been a ton of times where I did exactly what they did on the show, ie when they were arguing over who would be which ninja turtle (everyone wants to be leonardo or mike and no one wants donatello) the outbursts adam has are also really funny. This is a very strong comedy if you can appreciate drug humor, bad puns, and being juvenile. Its a super relateable show if you are a goofball.",2011

I think they are trying sooo hard to make things to be funny, and its just painful to watch how everything seem to be very forced. I found the story line/jokes to be cheesy. The whole thing is just overly done. Used to love the characters, but as story goes, I ended up disliking them lol. Adam's character is wayyy too over the top since season 1, I don't like him at all. He's probably like the ""Charlie"" on ""Its Always Sunny"", since hes the loudest, but I really like Charlie a lot as he seem to be more real and make audiences love him. Anders is boring as hell, and I do not see a strong personality here to stand out, even Gillian, I used to like her a lot, I think shes adorable, but sadly, not funny and boring as well :( She's funny at ""Curb"" though.

I have to say, If the first episode is any representation of what the show has to offer, then I was pretty disappointed. Especially now, since I'm reading some on the reviews here, people are claiming this to be ""one of the best shows ever."" This show seems to revolve around predictable cheap jokes with no substance. Don't get me wrong, jokes about dick-pics,smoking weed until you can't remember that you have a drug test at work the very next day, and desperately trying to find a urine sample could have potential to be VERY funny. However, I just felt the jokes felt a little forced. Like they though that if they just threw the joke in a goofy voice or quirky attitude and it's gonna automatically result in laughter. It may work for some people, sadly didn't work for me. This is the same problem I have with comedians like Daniel Tosh or Ray William Johnson, they deliver their jokes in a semi-quirky tone and expect people to laugh just because the idea was probably funny. How you present your jokes is just as important as the joke itself. Have you ever tried to retell a really funny joke to your friends and it didn't come out funny? That's because the delivery was off. This is the issue I see with this show. It definitely has potential but so far it hasn't won me over. I could see how some people could like this show but I'm totally confused as to people claiming this as one of the best shows ever.",2012

It's all recycled junk, and it's a blatant try hard of a show. The jokes are nothing new, I've heard them all before, and I see nothing creative about this show. Stop trying to remake stuff that was fine to begin with it and make it something worse. I understand taking inspiration from the old to create the new, but all this does it rip off the old. In other words, there's no inspiration in this TV show whatsoever. For all I know this could have been written by some 14-year-olds who know nothing about real office life other than what they see on old sitcoms.

I've watched the first 3 episodes multiple times and the latest one 5/19 930pm with the juggalos is my least favorite. blake plays my favorite character, his dialogue is the best and im praying that i can ""fur surrrre"" find that bear costume before halloween. anders has a unique role with his stiff anal tentative... wait what? adam has funny musical parts but sometimes its too much when he uses his body and voice in creepy ways, my wish is that the rest of the episodes are original beyond the previous.",2011
10,"This has to be one of the best shows out there. The show is about 3 best friends who live and work together. They do NOT work hard, but hey do play hard. They live life to the fullest and living vicariously through them, if only for 30 minutes is an excellent time. Here is a run down of the main characters. Ders is arguably the most responsible of the three. He used to be a competitive swimmer and once went ""20 Point"" a high point in his swimming career. He has high aspirations of being a successful politician one day and is constantly gunning for a promotion at Telemericorp, the company where they run down telemarketing lists all day. Blake is by far the most sensitive of the three. Much like the mom of the group he genuinely cares about everyone. He is a frequent contributor to Rancho Cucamonga chapter of the Justin Bieber online fan club, and does his best to police it. Adam ""Killzone"" DeMamp is the most outlandish of the three. He is hilarious. He is quick to say what is on his mind and is never afraid to GET Weird. He considers himself to be an amateur bodybuilder, and loves ""shmookin de wheerrds."" Sure he thinks a lot of himself but that confidence is hard to attain and he thrives off it. He is know as the ""Office Prankster"" after which he put spermicide on Der's french cruller. Adam DeMamp is and always will be one of the funniest characters on TV.",2012
9,"What can I say about Workaholics? I mean you have to watch it, really. I've been watching Comedy Central for South Park for the past few years, and very recently I caught an episode of this show after South Park. The episode of South Park before Workaholics had me already warmed up for some funny stuff, and then the first episode of Workaholics I saw just went in for the kill. It was hilarious, and it had me hooked. It's unorthodox. It's absurd, and it's silly. However, those are all done in a way that they are the most redeeming and endearing qualities of the show. It's just three working class stoners who are just starting to get into the workforce and start their adult lives, and all the twists, turns and misadventures they come across just living life. If you liked Office Space or almost any and/or every stoner comedy film or television show ever made, then watch this show. It will make you $h!t your pants from laughing. 9/10",2011
3,"This show is forced and not particularly funny. The acting is terrible, the writing bad, and the humor juvenile. There are some bright spots in the first season, but overall, it is more painful than funny. It may appeal to a younger audience (there's a lot of high school or college frat-level humor), but it's simply not smart or well-written comedy, and I can't see it appealing to a much wider audience than that. Do yourself a favor and watch Broad City or Silicon Valley. Both have a similar level of maturity, but they are actually well-written and humorous... and the acting in each of those shows is light years better than what you'll find here.",2016

I never expected this kind of show when i first saw it on comedy central and these actors aren't well known so i really didn't know what to expect but i am happy to report that it is AMAZING and really really entertaining so do not miss out on laughing your head of. Its about three guys working in an office under a kind of evil and tough boss who doesn't really like these three guys.

Not that C&C are gone, mind you...they toured last year, and have announced new projects, but I think it's 'high' time you vippershneppers had a stoner team to call your own, and dis is dem! John Cho & Kal Penn have made a real go of it as well, but Harold & Kumar are different - they're functional, intelligent dudes who get stupid when buzzed. My kinda guys wake up stupid, go to sleep stupid, and stay stupid for as many hours as pass between those two events. The Three Stooges are the all-time kings (and did it clean'n'sober best I know, to which I light my Bic); C&C most surely qualified; and if Adam, Blake & Ders can keep this hye-larious act going for at least a few more years, they will achieve stoner comedy Legend status, and the stanky crown of Cheech & Chong will have worthy heads to rest upon (though I'm not sure it'll fit over Blake's hair).

10,"Workaholics is definitely the most GNAR show on television right now. Season 3 just ended a few months back, and it was one of the funniest TV seasons that I've seen in years. Unlike many other comedies, Workaholics does not try ANYTHING sentimental (like Modern Family, The Office, etc. which are also good shows) and does not care about audience members 40 and up. You pretty much need to be in your 20s or early 30s to enjoy the humor, and if you do happen to be in that target audience then consider yourself lucky. The show is centered around 3 young men (Adam DeVine, Anders Holm, and Blake Anderson) who met in college and now live together & work as telemarketers at the same company. Their drug dealer Karl (Kyle Newacheck) is also one of the creators of the show. ",2013

8,"If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a ""super-you."" The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, ""What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?"" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented. ",2011
8,"This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.",2011
9,"You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, or at least that's what authors tell us. Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.",2011
8,A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching.,2011
9,"I have to say that this movie panders to my particular taste, which is to say it has a well crafted story for our times, good acting and just the right blend of New York atmosphere mixed with a sci-fi feel. The other main issue is drugs. I personally have partook in the search for an intelligence enhancing substance and it was quite believable to watch Bradley Cooper transform from a bohemian-slob to a brainiac-overacheiver. The characters were well written and thought-out. The situations were too close to home for me to ignore. The character driven story was exemplary to any current sci-fi films.",2011

4,"Limitless could be named deepless as it emphasizes on the mediocre rise of a middle-class loser into the sphere of money (bliss) America. However, this movie as a deep sociological impact, in a country where inequalities are on the rise and unemployment is here to stay, thanks to globalization/technology that exacerbate the two. The movie tells you one thing; you can't succeed in America without cheating. The storyline is absolutely pathetic: self-centered and egomaniac ""Bradley Cooper"" is here to realize the deepest frustration of the average fellow Top Tier university student lacking of intellectual curiosity. More important than the praise of individualism that finish in apotheosis with the most corrupt and probably most egomaniac job in America (senator), there is one major flawed: Why the smartest man on earth cannot make its own NZT drugs? The filming is crucial playing the role of lowering human critical thinking by inducing pseudo artsy effects to please the wannabee hipsters. Beside, the recent trend of mainstream psychological thrillers e.g. Black Swan, Inception, is working so well for the simple reason that it makes the audience feels smart, when in fact the very opposite happens.",2011
8,"I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)",2011
10,"I was skeptical at first about this movie, which is why I didn't go see it the week that it came out. I just figured it was all too obvious what would happen and to be honest some of that did happen yet they did the expected so well that it really didn't seem to make a big difference that I saw it coming a mile off. Which made the things that you didn't expect even better. I enjoyed this movie so much that I would do the unthinkable that I've done only once in all of my years, and that is pay to see it again at the theater. I may even buy a copy of it when it comes out on Blu Ray. THAT's how good this is. The acting was superb and what I enjoyed most is that finally someone knows how to end a movie. BRAVO",2011

6,"I was really looking forward to this movie. It has so much potential: an intriguing and clever concept, superb actors, decent script, good direction, sensational visual effects and editing, so what happened? I can't help but feel there was a great story driven film in here at one time during development. However, somehow studio executives -- no doubt pandering to the teenage boy demographic -- just had to add in all the predictable car chases and shoot-em-up gratuitous action. In the end this action was irritatingly distracting from the very captivating storyline that I kept on wishing they would come back to - i.e what happens when one has unlimited cognitive capacity. This is the same flaw that marred Christopher Nolan's otherwise fascinating story in Inception.",2011
2,"ALL SPOILERS AHEAD! WARNING! Who wrote this movie, a 6th grader? Why does the smartest man in the world do such stupid things? Why didn't he think of the best way to make an endless supply of the drug right away? Why didn't he figure out how to get rid of the Russian, instead of giving him what he wanted? Why did he choose the stock market and expose himself to all the attention? He could have made a vast fortune in his apartment, trading on FOREX. If he's so smart, why was he popping pills without knowing the eventual effects on his brain? Why was he running from the guy with the knife, who was following him? The guy knows where lives, that part was plain idiotic. I could go on and on, but the worst was, why would anybody that smart want to be in elective office. He would have far more power being a billionaire. This was a dumb movie, I actually was cheering for him to jump off the roof and my wife was telling me to shut up.

7,"Someone asked me once what I thought ADD medication does. I thought  about it for a second, and replied, ""In the simplest terms, it changes  your mind."" Sometimes, people's minds need changing. More than just a  push or a boost, sometimes people need help remembering things,  learning new things, making connections between things they already  know, motivating themselves to use that information, etc.  In the movie ""Limitless"", there's a pill that does all of that; and  much, much, much more.  The tagline for this movie is ""What if a pill could make you rich and  powerful?"" I prefer a line from the trailer: ""How many of us ever know  what it is to become the perfect version of ourselves?"" Bradley Cooper  plays Eddie Morra, a writer who can't motivate himself to write his  book even when he locks himself in a room with his laptop. He doesn't  do drugs (anymore), but anyone who looked at him would swear he was  always strung out. He doesn't have anything.  One day, Vernon (played by Johnny Whitworth), his ex-brother-in-law who  is also his ex-dealer, offers him some help: a clear, little round pill  that will clear his mind. Within a minute of taking it, Eddie finds he  can remember tiny things from years earlier, make connections between  little bits of information that he'd never given so much as a second  thought, reason with startling eloquence, and most importantly (to  him), slam out ninety pages of his book in one sitting that make his  publisher beg for more. Does he want more pills after all this?  Absolutely.  He's not the only one who wants them, though. Despite Vernon's initial  claim that the pill is ""FDA-approved"", it's clear soon enough that this  is nothing you'll ever find in a drugstore. Whoever Vernon got it from  (and however he got it), Eddie'll likely never know, because Vernon is  murdered shortly after he and Eddie reconnect. Eddie finds Vernon's  stash of clear little pills and proceeds to make over his life. He'll  need every ounce of intelligence the pills can give him, too, to fend  off a ruthless loan shark, the police officer who wants to know Eddie's  connection to the dead dealer, and whatever shadowy figure is following  him from the moment he starts taking the pills.  In the meantime, Eddie realizes he can do far more than write books  with his newfound intellect. In a few short days, he makes millions on  the stock market, bringing him to the attention of Carl Van Loon, one  of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world, played by Robert De  Niro. Carl is more than happy to benefit from Eddie's ""freak"" status,  and even cautions Eddie not to push himself too far. Eddie has the  brains, but Carl clearly has the experience (and the resources). He  warns Eddie to not try and become his competitor (read: enemy).  Finally, Eddie has to deal with the drug's side effects. He has waking  blackouts, often finding himself across town, in strange locations,  with complete strangers and no memory of how he got there. Withdrawal  symptoms are worse than your standard medication, obviously, and  stopping could mean hospitalization or worse. Since he doesn't know who  makes the pills or where to get more, this is his biggest problem.  Or would it be worse to stay on the pills? Eddie claims they're just  making him into a better version of himself, but are they, in fact,  changing who he is? Do they not just change what you can do, but also  what you will do? His girlfriend, played by Abbie Cornish, once had to  deal with a man who wouldn't do anything; now, she has to deal with a  man for whom there's nothing he wouldn't do. The end of the movie  leaves the question of just how much the pills change you unanswered.  Based on a novel written by Alan Glynn, this movie has plenty of action  sequences to complement the moral dilemma it poses: how far will you go  to become a ""better"" version of yourself? Like all the great science  fiction movies, this thriller doesn't focus on the sci-fi aspects,  choosing instead to highlight the exploration of humanity on which we  embark with the very first scene. And anyone who contemplates  medication to improve their lives will certainly find a resonance with  the character of Eddie Morra. Watching this movie may not change your  mind, but it will certainly open it.",2011

1,"Seriously the director and writers need help!.. the film Is basically a disaster of 100 never ending sub plots that start and don't end (completely pointless)...there are so many questionable scenes where you stop and think ""am I stupid enough to watch this"", the characters are all boring and cliché, you really wouldn't care if they live or die... , oh and the unnecessary narrating , seriously we're not dumb we understand what's going on, seriously the narrating explains everything going on as if the audience are blind or something...look I'm a really optimistic person but Im angry because the reviews on here convinced me to watch it seriously DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME :)",2011
4,"Limitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in our society. Addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power. Here is a guy like a lot of people in our society, supposedly down and out who then is given a drug that makes him smarter. What does he do with it, well what every man in this capitalistic society would do-he finds a way to make lots of money. The story does a good job of making you feel his addiction which I guess is because of some decent acting. The problem is the ending of the movie. Everyone who has become addicted to this drug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character. This is a mistake. There are always consequences when you are addicted to something whether it be drugs or power. There are always consequences when your actions are nothing but selfish. The movie should have had the guts to show that.",2011

10,"Shame, the real feel bad movie of the year, is only McQueen's second feature film to date. His first film, Hunger, focused on a man who made his life very public when he went on a hunger strike during the 1981 Irish Hunger Strikes. In Shame, McQueen dissects the very personal and often shocking sexual addiction of Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender). Brandon is a well off business man. He has an apartment in New York where he leads a seemingly good life, but hides a dark secret that is on the verge of destroying him. His sex addiction has gone out of control. To make this even more difficult, his sister drops in unexpected and crashes at his place (played by Carey Mulligan). Her lifestyle begins to interfere with his addiction, forcing him to take drastic measures.",2012
8,"Despite having never seen Steve McQueen's Hunger, the smouldering and sensational acclaim for Shame was simply unreal. Having heard terrific things about the film, I ventured out and snagged a last minute ticket to the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Weeks later, I am still trying to decipher what may be one of the most shocking and raw films I have seen in quite some time.",2011
9,"Brandon seems to be successful in life: a steady job, a nice apartment, good friends and success with women. But something prevents Brandon from having a relationship that lasts more than four months, this incapacity is due to the fact that Brandon is a sex addict: to casual encounters with strangers and prostitutes, to pornography (both during and after working hours), to masturbation. And to some extent he seems to have his addiction under control, until her sister Sissy arrives unexpectedly looking for a place to live for a while.",2012
10,"""Shame"" centers on Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a lonely, self-  alienated man in his thirties who tries his best to appear as your  average New Yorker with an office job whenever he finds himself out in  public. The trouble with this young man-- or his tragic flaw-- is that  whenever he finds a minute of privacy in his day, he hastily delves  into his own fabricated reality: a world of excessive sex, pornography,  and masturbation. The day Brandon's distressed, disruptive sister Sissy  (Carey Mulligan) barges into his condo looking for a place to stay  until things wind down and her sorrows disappear, his life begins to  spiral out of control. He grows increasingly frustrated with her as he  feels her invasive presence will bring about the exposure of his  deepest and darkest secrets. However, we see that this is just a  manifestation of his feelings of intense shame and regret for leading  the sad, artificial life he believes is the only one fit for him.  Steve McQueen has the sheer audacity to go where very few filmmakers  have dared to go before by making a film about sexual addiction and its  effects on the human mind. In this ambitious boldness, he doesn't want  to hold back on anything and he isn't afraid to show everything, so the  result is a film with enough full nudity and explicit sexual content to  receive an R-rating in Canada, which would probably translate to an NC-  17 rating in the US, unfortunately. There are several scenes in the  film where you literally see every inch of skin on the bodies of the  actors (Fassbender is probably the most physically exposed). Having  said that, this is never something that comes across as frivolous and  it only enhances the film's shock factor as a whole.  Michael Fassbender delivers the performance of a lifetime in ""Shame"",  and I currently can't see anyone else winning the Oscar for Best Actor  at the upcoming Academy Awards. He seems to understand his sad, lonely  character just as well as the screenwriters who gave birth to him (Abi  Morgan and Steve McQueen). Brandon is his own worst enemy, for he longs  to find solace in someone and discover genuine human affection, but the  other side of him remains too caught up in a shameful world detached  from real feelings and emotions. There are some scenes in the film  where we, the audience, are left alone with nothing but his  introspective, subdued presence as he reflects upon his actions in  regret. These scenes say more than most movies can say within their  entirety. It's thanks to Michael Fassbender's pitch-perfect performance  that we can step into his character's shoes and get to feel what he's  feeling. They say actions speak more than words; with ""Shame"", acting  speaks more than the inclusion of any sort of narration ever would.   Don't worry; I didn't forget about Carey Mulligan! I thought I would  highlight her performance separately, too. If I had to say only one  thing about it, I would emphasize how amazed I was at seeing her in  such an unusual, singular role. She has a tendency to play soft-spoken,  prim and proper characters-- but that's not the case with ""Shame"". She  really submerges herself into this disastrous, uncontrollable mess of a  young woman who never conceals her deepest feelings to the world-- be  it joy or sorrow. There's this one very memorable scene in the film  where she sings her own rendition of the jazz standard ""New York, New  York"" in a lounge (she's a singer who does gigs here and there), and  for the duration of the song, the camera stays focused on her face.  There are no cuts nor camera movements for a good five minutes (of  course, this won't come as a big shock to you if you have seen Steve  McQueen's ""Hunger""), yet somehow, this scene is absolutely  mesmerizing-- almost hypnotizing. Just the way she naturally glances  about apprehensively as this beautiful voice is unleashed (although it  probably isn't hers) is enough to send shivers down your spine.  What can I say about all the other aspects of the film? Well, since  Steve McQueen was the man behind the direction and shot composition,  it's no big surprise that ""Shame"" is expertly crafted in every little  detail. McQueen used the same cinematographer (Sean Bobbitt) and editor  (Joe Walker) of his first feature to achieve the same impressive  aesthetic look. Some parts of the film must have required so much time  and effort from the editor, it's hard to believe what was accomplished!  As for the cinematography, I'm sure you'll be floored by it within the  first five minutes of the film. In this opening scene, Brandon finds  himself staring at a woman sitting across from him as he is riding the  subway. He misunderstands her frightened glances and nervous attempts  to display her wedding ring as romantic advances, so when she gets off  in a panic at the next stop, he immediately follows her. In one of the  most beautiful, gliding shots I've ever witnessed-- with an emotionally  shattering musical composition by Harry Escott playing all throughout--  we see Brandon running up the station stairs and looking around for the  woman, only to realize that she had run away from him. His failure to  comprehend human interactions in this scene already gives us a distinct  perception on this poor character's serious vulnerability.  In sum, Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is a masterful character study with  top- grade performances from Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan and  a raw power unmatched by any other film I've seen. This is surely not a  film for everyone, as it deals with dark, gritty topics often labeled  as far too controversial for the big screen. But if you're open to true  cinema, here's a devastating powerhouse of a film that will chill you  to the bone and forever stay with you.",2011
10,"This was not an easy film to watch and even less easy to reflect on. However, I thought it was a great film. Original and brave. The acting was totally convincing and the theme important and challenging. The repeated reminders of the hypocrisy of our society regarding sex and violence were clever and uncomfortable. I was very disappointed, but not surprised, that this film received no recognition at the awards ceremony. Normally, ""sex, sells"" is written on the heart of all promoters. But not in this case, as it is not at all titillating. A genuinely adult film (not the usual meaning). Fine performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carry Mulligan.",2012
8,"This film instantly drew me in. Fassbender's performance is complex and truly believable.I can honestly say that if you are not haunted by the torment of both Michael Fassbender's and Carey Mulligan's performance, then you are in denial. The pain is apparent, the intrigue of what happened to these siblings is staring you in the face throughout the film. The role's Fassbender has chosen lately have made me an ultimate fan! Another McQueen movie, HUNGER, also stars Fassbender as an Irishman in political protest against the corrupt government of the ""80's. I tremendously enjoy watching him on the screen. Michael Fassbender relays raw emotion and true passion to create believable and relatable characters. Im looking forward to future projects.",2011
8,"Steve McQueen made a real impact in the film world with his powerful debut Hunger. But like with musicians, there is always the risk that a director's second film will not live up to the high expectations the first effort sets. Yet McQueen has a good go with his dark exploration of human character in Shame.",2011
8,"Michael Fassbender's commitment is overwhelming. He must trust his director, implicitly. Good for him. Very rarely we've been exposed to so much sex without an ounce of erotic flavors. Well, that was not the intention, clearly. This is a remarkably serious film about addiction.To make matters even darker I had seen Michael Fassbender as Jung only a few days before. What an actor! Now I feel I'm as familiar with his anatomy as Mrs. Fassbender must be. I must admit the film stayed with me because within its mathematical coldness there is a palpable element of horror. Was it me or Fassbender shows the face of death in one of the many sexual occasions? Chilling really. I will take my chances and recommend it, as long as you don't take your children - I guess you can't NC17 - or your grandparents.",2011
1,"I will summarize my opinion: This is a bad film, with a bad script, with gratuitous use of sex, with not-explained inferences and without a message and ending. Do not waste your time watching it. Since I have to write 10 lines of text - the above would suffice - here it goes: Please explain to me what is the relationship between Brandon and Sissy his sister? Does they practiced incest? Did they had a brute father? Were they abandoned by their mother? In other words, what is the real cause of Brandon's weird sexual behavior and deviations? Clearly the guy is abnormal, but why? Besides, it simply does not makes sense that he wishes to have sex with every woman that crosses his path, but he is also impotent, seemingly a gay who has not yet left the closet and a voyeur. And if the readers really wish to have a reason for not watching this film, the guy spends long times doing nothing. As for his sister, her story is a not-story since it never becomes clear what is bothering her. Once again, a bad script badly directed. BTW I am not a bigot neither a prude.",2012

Since seeing this buzzed-about film last evening, my mind has been swirling around the many elements I disliked along with genuine curiosity as to how it has fared so well in reviews.",2011
1,"I wouldn't say the film is badly acted or badly made. It keeps your interest until the end because you would like to know what happens next, or what's the point, what's the message - only to arrive at the end and discover that in fact nothing of interest or significance happens, there is no point, and there is no message - apart maybe from the boring whining about how the search for pleasure without love end up in misery and death - but do we really need to sit for nearly two hours to ""learn"" this? ",2013
3,"If you want to know how filmmaker Steve McQueen feels about his protagonist, look no further than the title of this film.",2011
1,"SPOILERS Brandon (Michael Fassbender) has a lot of really hot sex and he's unhappy. That's the movie in a nutshell. When this movie ended, I thought, ""Is that all there is?"" The unhappiness theme is established at the start. It is reiterated throughout the film. OK, he's unhappy, I get it.",2012
5,"Masterpiece? Really? I had expectations after seeing the trailer and having seen Fassbender play in other movies, but boy was I disappointed! Not by the actors, even though I thought Carey Mulligan was better in other movies, Michael Fassebender is actually the only good thing I kept from the movie. Thhe story doesn't go anywhere in my opinion. McQueen only gives glimpses of few things that are abandoned right away like his relationship to his colleague, his family past, his sister (wasn't it the center point of the movie, to have a situation where she disturbs everything? she's not present enough for me). I would have preferred to have shorter or fewer sex scenes (all the sex showed does not serve the story that much after a while we've seen it all!) and more deeper views on Brandon's relationships. ",2012
1,"The story focuses on a man who is consumed with self gratification sexually. He is also in inner turmoil to some extent. His sister moves in with him unexpectedly and there are subtle references to her wanting him sexually. Beyond this shallow contrived plot line...there is nothing really going on. The movie just didn't go anywhere. The acting was okay, but there is a scene of his sister singing an entire new york new york song...really. Another scene shows him running in the streets for like 5 minutes. It felt like the director needed to add lots of fluff to this movie to make it 2 hours or whatever time it ran. It was boring and not worth watching in my opinion.",2012
1,This is one of the worst films I have seen since Benjamin Button. I feel that an evening of my life has been taken from me that I will never get back. The only positive comment about this film is that it was not as long as Benjamin Button.,2012

2,"Meretricious is not a word I use very often but it is the perfect description for this film which like many other indie art-house movies based on similar themes of urban alienation/sexual obsession/existential crises etc are really mildly titillating soft porn dressed up (or not as the case may be) as intimate and hard hitting character driven,profound and 'provocative' film making - which this is definitely NOT. Just another film which exploits a sexually provocative subject matter and uses it as a reason to 'explore' the theme with lots of shagging scenes and justifies all this with a tenuously strung together plot which tries to insinuate profounder levels of meaning and emotional truth which are in fact non existent.The actors try their best to convey this deeper meaningfulness and the director fancies himself as Antonioni I imagine but he's not, and of all the Steve McQueens I know of i think he is the less talented one, and I know two - one the iconic movie star and the other one works in my local Cafe Nero and does spectacularly good smoothies.",2012
1,"Yes only insecure types who needing to affirm their personality will like this, as they believe by endorsing this they elevate themselves into the league of self proclaimed Illuminati.

1,"I hate these kind of films. You're obliged to be utterly impressed by them, and I bet even the actors themselves go with the common flow of appreciating them only because it's so right to be impressed by them. I get so weary with that everlasting overemphasizing of sex and all that has to do with it. Don't you see, it's mere poverty man, and we're nicely following the paths of nature. What's so special about that? Must I have heavy opinions about a man who is sexually obsessed (yawn) and get's confronted with all that's contrary to that, with life, with the bias development of events occurring to everyone? Get a life, dude! This is soooo boring... I have no commitment whatsoever with a person that behaves like an underdog, feels like an underdog, and actually IS an underdog. Where is an uplifting point; where is greatness; where valor?",2012
1,i will always remember not to watch anything by Steve McQueen. i just want my money back. this movie falls in the same category as Trespass or Sleepers. What a stupid movie. I would not watch it even if I'd be paid to. Is it trying to teach us about the dangers of porn? The follow up question is what 18 year old doesn't know the side effects of porn. My take is that Mr McQueen is duping us into believing that his movie is full of action by putting up 18sln - just a man showing dick and ass. Not even proper shagging. There was no storyline at all. The movie sucks big time. Where in the world a married boss meets the sister of a subordinate and bangs her on the same night in the condo of the subordinate while the subordinate is listening to the bonking moaning? Only in a dumb movie.,2012
3,"For an hour and a half almost nothing happens. The film has almost no plot. The protagonist does not seem like a sex addict, he looks more like a normal single man who likes to sleep with different women without commitments and watching porn. The film ends and we still don't know what is the damn problem with his sister, the only thing we know is that she decides to commit suicide. People who say they see a complex and dark story in this script must have a very boring life. There are a lot of scenes that add nothing to the story. As the interminable scene where Sissy sings ""New York, New York"" or the subway trips where nothing happens. I do not question the work of the actors, but the script is very poor and this movie is full of disposable parts. I guess this movie may like to very conservative people looking to see soft porn scenes, but not much more than that.",2012

5,The Bad,2011
7,"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.",2011
9,"Firstly, this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever so read on. I had the privilege to watch this in the El Capitan theater advanced screening. Johnny Depp, the goofy pirate that we have grown to love, returns to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed tale of truth, betrayal, youth and demise.",2011
8,"As far as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies go, On Stranger Tides may be lacking in the rollicking fun of Curse of the Black Pearl, which I absolutely loved, though it's closer in spirit to it than those of the two movies before, but I think it is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had great effects and a brilliant Bill Nighy but felt overlong and ferentic sometimes, and At World's End, which had the cast giving their all, great visuals, score and final battle but rather convoluted and bloated on the whole.",2011
7,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy; but the new cast members keep it feeling fresh.",2011
7,"After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series have returned in ""On Stranger Tides."" Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the ""Pirates"" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The ""new"" course set by ""On Stranger Tides"" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.",2011

1,"Oh, Dear, I love Johnny Depp and the PotC movie experience, but this one is best left out... So sorry I bothered... The characters were so lackluster, I did not care about any of them... But the script was so poor, how can you expect the actors to salvage it??? Ian McShane: wasted, Penelope Cruz: looked as if she was struggling with pregnancy discomfort, Mermaids and the religious man: put me to sleep and pure filler... Filmed way too dark which made it difficult to see my several glances at my watch to see when I could leave... Tedious in all the darkness... Depp is reported to have earned $55,000,000 with this and actually had script input.... Get new writers! I wanted so bad to see a good PotC movie after the last (Land's End) rubbish, but I was disappointed once again... Depp and Cruz had zero chemistry between them... It was not a 'love interest'.... They appeared to barely know each other... At least O Bloom and K Knightly looked like they had feelings for each other... I don't think Capt Jack even needs a 'love interest', he's a rogue out for adventure and pirate booty (Ok, that does not mean 'women'!). Cruz did nothing for me and could have been left out entirely....",2011
5,So after a 4 year hiatus Disney decides to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow. A huge fan of the first one and moderately enjoyed the second one and confused by the third one I was ready to see a fresh crew for the this new installment. ,2011
8,"Boy, the way some people are acting on the web, you would think that Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was the devil. I saw this movie opening day with pretty good expectations, because I love the Pirate movies, even if the third one is too complicated at times, I really enjoy these movies. Let's face it, we wouldn't have been brought back to the pirate genre if it wasn't for these movies. I agree that the plots should be more simple, but I don't mind a movie that challenges you along. I actually did love On Stranger Tides, even though it's not as good as the first one, I give much kudos for giving us something very fresh. Not to mention that it's shorter so I would think that more people would be pleased with that. But I think the cast still has it, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always such a pleasure to watch on screen. He and Penelope Cruz really lit up the screen and brought life into the series. This is a fun summer blockbuster with scary moments, funny characters and a swash buckling good time.",2011
1,"Jack Sparrow...I mean Captain Jack Sparrow, it's probably time to hang your boots and bury your sinking pirate career before dirt-storm wrecks whatever remains of my sweet memories of the original Jack Sparrow legend, the Curse of the Black Pearl. Although, I wasn't half as impressed with its sequels, somehow even in those movies the Pirate magic weaved its way into the hearts of loyal fans, many of whom I'm sure are as aggrieved and disappointed as I am, just choosing to remain silent out of respect and love for the Jack Sparrow we all knew and cared about. However it needs to be said, the current version achieves nothing apart from making you scratch your head in frustration. ",2011
1,"I have enjoyed most of the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but decreasingly so. Now, it seems with 3D, you do not have to have a movie which has a story, just a bunch of fight scenes, people fighting to win a race to get to the fountain of youth.",2011
1,"Just be entertaining. But, you couldn't even do that could you Pirates4. Oh well, you'll be too busy counting your money to care anyway, wont you. Nice job marketing department. ",2011
7,"These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Don't worry I won't give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it.",2011
7,"The movie was fun and Captain Jack Sparrow was at his best. But even though I enjoyed the movie overall because of Captain Jack Sparrow and the fun adventure, I do see what people mean by it feels empty. There are times when it just carries on with no sense of adventure in it. The second one was too long the third too many sub plots with a a messy script and too long, but they both had a sense of fun and adventure with memorable parts in Dead Man's Chest with the Wheel fight on the island, Jack and the crew escaping the cannibals was a fun action scene, Davy Jones and the Kraken scenes and with At Worlds End the fight scene in Singapore, the adventure to Davy Jones locker with the ship going through a ice cave, flipping the ship upside down, scenes with Davy Jones, and the epic last battle with the Pearl and Flying Dutchman fighting around a maelstrom. Gore handled the action scenes perfectly but the fault in them was that if they trimmed parts out and worked harder if could have been a much better film, but as were, still good adventures with a sense of fun. The beginning action scene in On Stranger Tides, I thought was fun as when they where trying to mutiny Blackbeard, but I thought the action scenes with Gore were funner and more arousing, not that on stranger tides were embarrassingly bad but not as edge of my seat fun action scenes as with the first three. This movie also provided memorable scenes, when we first meet the mermaids is going to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, and the jungle scenes and fountain of youth and Jack escaping in London scenes look very good and cool. And like I said earlier Captain Jack is funny and having a blast in this. Going back to On Stranger Tides not having as many memorable set pieces, it does fix in having a shorter less all over the place feel. Captain Jack and Barbossa when together were great. I was little upset and felt I was going to be disappointed because of the reviews, so this movie had to prove me wrong and make me like it and it did, cause Captain Jack was silly/ witty and having fun and so was I. Did some parts feel like they weren't leading to places, yes and I would hire new writers because besides the first one there were faults with the script, its like if thats the ideas in the movie you want, build around that and make a better, sharper script. It might have faults like in the script and writing like the other two sequels but like those two it still has a sense of fun, this one being with Captain Jack at his best.",2011

1,"I watched this film at the Cinema with very high hopes- Everyone knows the 2nd and 3rd instalments weren't as good as the Black Pearl and this certainly didn't improve anything. I sat through this with complete predictability- Purely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to stagger about doing his Captain Jack- and to be honest, this holds no novelty any more. A boring storyline that no-one cares about, Penelope Cruz attempting to take over from Keira Knightly, and Geoffrey Rush having no idea who's side he was on. The magic has well and truly gone- and sadly the Pirates legacy is one of being just a cash cow for Disney. A very Tired and uninspired attempt that would certainly put you off awaiting a fifth.",2011
8,This movie is a top movie to watch this summer and I highly recommend it for Pirates of the Caribbean fans and people who just want to see a kick ass movie this summer. It is a great much anticipated addition to the pirates franchise.,2011
6,"Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.",2011
4,"Here's a franchise that definitely needs to be put to bed and fast. Directed by Rob Marshall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides"" is mostly a bore and more rehash and retread than anything else. Depp and Rush are back at it as their characters, but the characters themselves have completely worn out their welcome. The story is over-long, and has a couple of fairly interesting sequences - one being Depp's initial escape from the King of England, and two a Mermaid ""battle"", but these last only a scant 20 min of the bloated 130 min runtime. I fast-forwarded through a good chunk of this movie. You'd think they'd figure it out that a movie needs a lot more than a new character and quest for it to be worth your viewing time. Give it a miss.",2012
8,"Thoroughly enjoyable! Although the plot could have been more substantial, it is worth 2 hours and 15 minutes of your time. Because there were so many sub-plots in P.O.C. At Worlds End, I had to go see that one twice to make sure I understood it all - but I still loved it. On Stranger Tides was perhaps a little *too* simple, I think....but again, I still enjoyed it. Note: Ian McShane should have been nastier & meaner. In the scheme of things, Cutler Beckett (from P.O.C. 2 & 3) was a more despicable and unlikable character than Blackbeard turned out to be. Just for perspective, I am a grandmother and I am happy to say that I am still a die-hard P.O.C. fan. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush might cringe if they saw this, but I could sit and listen to Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa read a dictionary for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Here's hoping for another P.O.C. in 4 or 5 years - and I am sure with a clever script they will get the formula just right. Forget the critics - it's a fun movie. Go see it. Now! Savvy?",2011

I went into this movie with an open mind wanting to see it anyway despite the horrid reviews it's been getting from critics. (I generally tend to ignore the critics especially for movies that I personally think will be worth seeing in theaters) the trailer looked pretty cool for this one, so I went in expecting at the least an awesome super gory action flick. What I got was the total opposite and a huge disappointment for me. The critics are right. Conan the Barbarian is overall an absolutely terrible movie.",2011

2,"I am struggling to actually review this movie, not because of its weak story-line or because of its total lack of imagination, or even because of its gratuitous violence (most of which is hidden), but because the one thing that was missing was a lighting engineer. Yes folks, this is an object lesson in how to make a low budget blockbuster movie, though how much money was actually saved by shooting seventy-five percent of the film in darkness I don't know. However the other cost saving was certainly well designed, a few decent cameramen who could actually keep the shot in focus would have spoiled the whole thing for me. Out of focus darkness was entertaining for the first ten minutes, after that it became irritating, the big fight scene in the last ten minutes of the film is lost completely but then that will have saved on the cost of giving the monster too much detail, rather than leaving it a a piece of wet hose pipe. What a waste of time and money, not the production companies, but mine, I can sit in the dark with some flickering lights at home for free. There was one decent fight scene in the film about half way through, but it was certainly not worth the ticket price. One of the worst and most irritating films I have seen for a long time.",2011

1,"Fans have waited for 29 years for a new Conan movie and then we get this disaster. Obviously this was not going to be as good as the John Milius movie, but they could have at least tried. Maybe some people can enjoy this as a totally brainless action movie, but this is a bad fantasy movie and a worse Conan movie. The new Conan reminds me of the 80s Conan ripoff barbarian movies. First we have a narrator voice that certainly doesn't belong to a bloody barbarian movie. Then we have the ridiculousness of conans dad performing c-section in the middle of battle and then the movie spends 20 minutes with a little kid Conan. Apparently a cimmerian test of manhood or something is running around in a forest sucking an egg in your mouth and then the child Conan runs into some enemy tribesmen that are growling like orcs and kills them all. There is no need to try to prove how badass the hero is by having him slaughtering people when he is still a child. That is simply not believable just silly. Well then the tribe gets slaughtered by the evil warlord and conans dad is killed. Not even trying to be original here. The rest of the movie is some swordfights some monsters and some more swordfights. The only good thing was Stephen Lang as the villain. Khalars witch daughter was also fun. If Jason Momoa really was the best Conan they could find I guess that says something about todays action heroes, but at least he is not wearing the same ridiculous makeup he has when playing Drogo. I just don't understand how some people can say that this movie represents Robert E Howards original Conan? They must be talking about some different Howard. The same people who have spent years whining about how the classic Arnold movie was not loyal to the original stories are now thinking this is. This movie has no more connection to the original stories then the 80s movies did. I cant possibly imagine Jason Momoa in the original stories. People who keep saying this guy is the ideal original Conan should consider for example the story where Conan defeats the giant strangler in battle of pure strenght and breaks his neck. Can you actually imagine Momoa in that scene? The Milius movie was not loyal to the stories but it was an awesome movie with a unique feel and original ideas and it actually looked like something out of an ancient world where magic was real. The original movie also had the spirit of Howards best stories with a Nietschean survival of the fittest philosophy. The new Conan is bad Hollywood fantasy made by talentless hacks. The next Conan movie will probably be direct to DVD. The scriptwriters and director Marcus Nispel should never work again.",2011
4,SPOILERS FOR BOTH CONAN MOVIES FOLLOW,2011
2,"I enjoyed the 1982 Conan the Barbarian, and went into this movie not expecting a film as good but one to be entertaining. Alas, this Conan the Barbarian only has the costume and set design going for it. Everything else is pretty much a disaster. The music score is not as memorable, or as epic or as haunting. The direction has inconsistencies with the tone especially all over the map. The dialogue is cliché-ridden and as much as I am starting to dislike using the term anachronistic the term applies to me here, the story is dull and sluggish and the characterisations feel little more than stock stereotypes. The acting doesn't help, Stephen Lang has good presence but has nothing to work with. The lead on the other hand has no charisma whatsoever. Overall, disappointing and weak. 2/10 Bethany Cox",2011
8,"Initially I had some reservations about watching this movie, because of the legendary older Conan movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger. That and the fact that remakes usually end up being insulting to the original versions. But it lack of better to do, I sat down and watched this 2011 ""Conan the Barbarian"" movie.",2011

Having read a lot of Conan though, including the original stories and the more recent Dark Horse comics, I don't think that John Milius got it right.",2011
10,"I really do not understand why the critics were so hard on this movie....This movie cannot be compared to the old Conan, It stands on it's on. This movie gave us everything you look for in an action, adventure, FANTASY movie. Come on people, fantasy, lighten up! We could not of asked for a better Conan, he had the roughness, skill, body and looks! Why would you want to watch an ugly Conan for 2 hours, he was super sexy and he moved like a cat, loved Momoa! Stephen Lang played an amazing war lord and his freaky daughter; Rose Mcgowan, awesome, could not of been weirder, why not, it's a FANTASY movie......The major actors all do good jobs and some of the minor characters actually steal their scenes. Young Conan is totally impressive, yes he is majorly angro but can you blame him? It is sad that this movie did not hit it big in the theatres and that people were so stuck on comparing it to the old Conan movies. When will there be another movie like this?? Never, it's all the same boring bs these days. This movie stayed true to Robert E Howard's style and the comics. There will probably be no sequel, which I think is a total loss for this franchise. All you negative, boring people out there need to lighten up! I loved this movie for what it was and I am bummed we will not get to see a sequel.....So sad.",2011
8,"first of all I will say my point of view as a film viewer, Conan fan, REH purist and all in all as a man with a open mind. This film made me puzzled...the directing could be better, the story is quite good, as for Conan I know worse than this, but the funny elements as catapult, catapulted my mood directly the opposite way and the egg race was dumb (proven to be a warrior with running with eggs in your mouth ???? I thought proving that you are a man was breaking the neck of a Cimmerian Bull). Small things that make the film just silly like going on a trip around hyborian inland with a ship. On the other hand parts as the dweller and Acheron made me really satisfied having that REH Cthulhu mythos stories look , plus the scenery was great. Jason as Conan is great at least he can move and has a voice for Conan. Conan is no Bodybuilder, he is a Savage (or as many call him a barbarian, although I do not like to use the word). The others - Lang, great, Perlman (one of my fav. actors) could show more, but did not have so much space, Tamara and others - hmm playing the second violin to Conan as the others except of Lang, who is a great baddie, but hey, this is no soap opera here, it is Conan, that has to be straightforward action, and that this film deliveres. From the REH point of view, There were lots of remarks (Tower of the elephant, Yara, Zingara, Acheron ...) so I liked it a lot this way, since this is an origin story of Conan and thus something like a ""Welcome back it's so long we missed you"" film. If they will do the Frost Giant's daughter/Queen of the black coast (Sean Hood all alone script no Oppenheimer crap) as part two, then I can accept this number one without Howard's story (1982 and 1984 were also Howardless stories as well). All in all, compared to the comics adaptations and other action films done this day, this one stands strong, it is a love it or hate film for all film viewers, Conan fans, REH purists. It is indeed a film that divides and devours as a slice of the Conan's sword. I give it a ",2011

So much is made with computers that it looks fake and most of todays movies don't have the blood and gore anymore which they deserve to have, which will make a movie so much better.

It's not perfect, but it has enough action, fantasy, and pretty ladies to satisfy any fantasy-action junkie. As for it being a remake, I can't compare it to the original at this time because I have not seen it. But I do know Arnold would make a better Conan than Jason Momoa.",2013
8,"Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.",2011
9,"You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of them fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!",2011
9,"It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room, a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of ""Oh no!"" even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that, much like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times, painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.",2011
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.",2011
9,"I saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! ",2011
10,"Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.",2011
5,"I loved Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's ""I Love You Philip Morris"" but it must have been terribly frustrating for them, having to wait 2 years for the release and then, not finding an audience in sufficient numbers, not even with Jim Carrey. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" seems like a totally understanding attempt to go main stream and get the kind of box office response that will allow them to go on. I think Ficarra and Requa are two enormous talents - remember their script for ""Bad Santa? - the market needs made them do this silly, complacent, undercooked comedy. Something so far away from what they've done before that I hope we haven't lost them forever. I didn't believe for a minute that Julianne Moore and Steve Carrell were a couple. I love Ryan Gosling but didn't believe for a minute he will dedicate himself to the Carrell character. And Carrell's outburst at his son's graduation seems a monumental miscalculation. What's great about stealing your own son's thunder. I don't get Carrell, I must confess. I can't wait for him to play a serial killer. That will get him an Oscar nomination. To make things even more puzzling, Kevin Bacon plays a joke of a part and he's photographed without any regard. I'm puzzled and a little bit annoyed.",2011
9,"I will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. It was a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Steve keeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strength but never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most ""sappy-est"" of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twist at the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do however wish that they would have developed a little more back story with Ryan's character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma delivers some nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! I believe Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to play that main love role and still maintain his ""funny guy"" image.",2011
8,"I actually found it quite engaging eventually; it was a little hard to get into at first but when the narrative began to settle down I could see a structure there that had potential. Brief summary: When Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces to her husband Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce, his world collapses around him. She had slept with another man, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and Cal finds that hard to take since they had been together since high school. He takes to going to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) who shows him how to dress, behave and (most importantly) how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful (eventually) but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhile there are a couple of other sub-plots going on. One involves Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), who has become infatuated with his babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). She, meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal With me so far?... Also, there is law student, Hannah (Emma Stone) who Jacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him (I can't really say any more about her without giving too much away, so here I'll stop). All these threads eventually tie together in what (at times) appears like a French farce, but which does ultimately have a very valid point.",2012
2,"This film reminded me a lot of Little Miss Sunshine, a ""dysfunctional family"" comedy I also hated. Things that are actually way creepy and/or disturbing are played for laughs, for example:",2011
6,"After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.",2011
6,"I feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has. We've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new. OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there it would be 10, Carrell & Gosling give good performances and really gel as a duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid section drags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz that really shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comedies always do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, it couldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it's just a pity the project is wanting.",2011
8,"just the usual storyline..parents break up in the beginning and get back together at the end..but the things that happen in between makes this movie a lot different, a lot better than other movies of same genre.. the positives are the way they have treated this story line, the cast, their acting -steve carell keep this movie going and Ryan gosling looks really stunning with his perfect abs..but the screenplay cud have been bit better..most of the scenes takes place in the bar..those thing make the movie go slower..and also the same old clichés like mom cheating over dad, and dad getting back to the family in a thought provoking, eye opening speech in the end are bit dramatic...but whatever said, if only the pace of the movie was good then this movie could have become one of the best movies in this genre",2012
1,"I went to see this upon reading the cast members...Marisa Tomei, Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, wow. But what a waste of talent for these people, and a waste of time for me as well. The story felt very sloppy, and the characters were bland as a result. Steve Carell's role reminded me of his role in ""40-yr-old virgin"": nerdy middle-age guy with little sexual experience. Sure he managed to be funny at parts but talk about typecast! Ryan Gosling's role meant to be a muscular dandy but came off as border-line homosexual. His upper body seemed to occupy an unhealthy amount of screen time. And one scene they put Steve Carell's face right on Ryan Gosling's groin area-what the hell was that all about? Oh and the whole thing about the 17-yr-old babysitter taking naked photos of herself for Cal(Steve Carell)-what?? How's that funny? It's rather disturbing! Julianne Moore's performance was kind of generic and I couldn't take one more shot of her teary, blank stare. And I also thought their kid (Jonah Bobo) was horrid! His character was the most painful to watch, following by Emma Stone. My! What a terrible actress. The total lack of depth of the film was astounding. Please can someone tell me what's the point of the story? I mean, really. I think it was made for people that are grown up on the outside but still 8-yr-olds on the inside. For the real grown-ups, it might leave a bad taste in your mouth, so be warned.",2011
1,"So, I thought I would check out the state of the contemporary rom-com, and this seemed like a good bet. I mean, actors like Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, how can you go wrong? ",2013
3,7.6? Have you all gone mad? This movie sucked. I laughed about 3 times.,2011
10,"Once in a great while I watch a movie that I really enjoy... this is that movie. The actors in this movie are great! Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors now. Prior to this I had only seen him in Drive, The Believer and Lars and the Real girl. Just on those 4 movies alone, talk about a diverse spectrum of roles. The confident all around cool guy is the role you would almost expect him to get type casted into, but this is the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Coming from a hedro, he's one sexy bitch!!! ",2012

Her best friend that she's known for years is Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Lillian announces that she's getting married and that she wants Annie to be her maid of honour. Annie is initially excited but then realises that she will be alone again. Worse still is that Lillian is using four other women to help organise the wedding, including the dominating Helen (Rose Byrne), who she met less than a year ago. Helen and Annie compete furiously to outdo each other on the wedding plans but its Annie and her relationship with Lillian which comes off worse. Adding a little bit of joy to Annie's life is patrol officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) as they start to slowly connect.",2011
1,"Everyone dubbed this one as top 50 (or even 10) romantic-comedies OF ALL TIME. I don't get it. I honestly don't. Firstly the characters are gross, and secondly I don't see a story at all? And lastly I dislike Annie to a certain extent that I don't want to root for her. I'd love a movie of self-actualization mixed with comedy and romance, but the comic relief in this film is ridiculous and instead of laughs I get second-hand embarrassment, the bad kind. I don't see how this warrant as a good film, it has none of the elements that makes up a good film. ",2015
3,"OK. After seeing the previews of this movie, it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However, I heard so many great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Let's just say, my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.",2011
10,"I saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself, wow this seems like the female version of the HangOver. While it was not along the same plot as the HangOver, it was about the moments leading up to the wedding. At first I looked around the theater and noticed it was 95% women and I started to feel like I had made a mistake. But by the end I was pleasantly surprised that there was a lot good humor involved. Some of it would be considered guy humor, but actually had all the women in the theater laughing their asses off. There is a bit chick flick element to it between the main character and a guy, but it is such a small part of the movie that I would say it's about 85% comedy and 15% romance/chick flick. So as a guy, I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie. Most of these types of movies are about guys making complete asses out of themselves and you almost never see the same from women. Hollywood always likes to make women seem perfect, but you see women making crude remarks about their own genitals and it's nice to see that women can be funny in this regard as well. I think this was a great movie for female humor, because I have long thought that comedy was dominated by male actors and I am just waiting for some women to jump in there and start paving the way. Good job on this movie!",2011
1,"I wish I had read the negative reviews posted here prior to seeing this waste of time and money. The plot was a muddy, hackneyed, meandering mess, the acting mostly so-so, and the subject matter includes graphic depictions of diarrhea and vomiting. If that's your thing you'll love it. All of the funny scenes were in the trailers. The protagonist was such a whiny loser I kept hoping that someone would bump her off.You know there's a problem when your ""bad"" girl comes off looking like a nicer and more sympathetic person overall. Anything that was supposed to be a joke or a funny situation was hammered home with a 15 pound sledge hammer- and then repeated! This movie took over two hours to get to a place it had no business ending up, I.E. a happy ending for Annie. Her ""redemption"" was way too little, way too late and was contrived as hell. This movie is now my new standard for really bad, bad waste of film. My wife wanted to see it based on trailers and the mostly good reviews. She had to cover her eyes during the bathroom scenes and found the whole movie to be one of the absolute worst she has ever seen. If you must waste $20 bucks(roughly two tickets) take a $20 bill, shred it in a food processor, then flush it down the toilet. Do this while eating popcorn and you'll have the same overall feeling of having seen this movie.",2011
9,"My friends invited me to a preview screening of Bridesmaids last night, and I accepted the invitation with a sense of cautious optimism. The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me, but I was intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.",2011
2,"Let me begin by saying that I'm a man and that I went to see this movie with my wife, not under duress, I was looking forward to seeing it. Let me add here that in an almost full theater I counted four other men in the audience which would lead me to believe that I was definitely not the target audience for this movie. That being said, my wife didn't like it either, she actually disliked it even more than I did.",2011
10,The most laugh-out-loud moments I've witnessed in a movie theater since There's Something About Mary. This should make Wiig a star -- and she deserves it (she has a Meg Ryan quality). The rest of the cast is hilarious also. ,2011
3,"I am a bit surprised at the other reviews for this movie, my college aged daughters were eager to see it and our family found it more tragic than anything else, especially for the lead character. Both daughters said they felt more like crying than laughing and wanted to see something else to ""cleanse the palate"" before calling it a night. Kristin Wiig is very talented and will likely follow up with more movies, but we found her character too sad, in an age where lots of young people are unemployed, underemployed or going bankrupt. A lot of the humor was gross - I guess we don't find mass diarrhea in wedding clothing that funny. We found Melissa McCarthy particularly unfunny and almost painful to watch.",2011
1,"I don't know what you folks and the reviewers have been smoking! This was the most embarrassing movie my wife and I have ever seen. ""Dumb and Dumber"" was a 10 compared to this fiasco. Let me count the ways it sucked. 1. The stomach flu scenes in the bathroom and on the street were an absolute embarrassment. 2. Everything about the flight to Las Vegas was stupid. 3. The first boyfriend was an imitation in and out of bed. 4. The bride who let everyone make the decisions for her. 5. The deal with the giant cookie. Have I said enough? If I could have, I'd have asked for my money back. I cannot remember when I last saw such a bad excuse for humor. My wife agrees 100% with me.",2011

This is a chick flick for dudes... the anti-chick flick ""chick flick"" if you will.",2011
1,"I never thought it possible, but ""Bridesmaids"" proves you can create a worse, more cringe-inducing film than the ""House Bunny"" (it may even compete with the Jackass franchise, and oddly, on a major portion of its own turf). I left before it was over, and only stayed long enough to see if some nearby, later scene could possibly be any worse than those I had endured already (a thought that was most vivid as we concluded the scene at the dress shop and I tried to imagine something worse than the fat bridesmaid's performance at the sink). Mission accomplished in the very next scene (as the bride made it to the curb). I had the distinct impression, observing my fellow theater goers in stitches, that I was participating in some deleted scenes from ""Idiocracy"". No such luck, as this actually happened.",2011
9,"This is like a big slap in the face to all the lame chick flicks out there as of now and a breakthrough, star making leading role for the brilliant and hilarious Kristen Wiig. I have never seen a comedy in a long time that was as consistently funny and I mean laugh on the ground with tears coming down your face funny as well as touching and for once genuine characters that you can relate to and have an instant, believable, bond and chemistry on screen that makes the ongoing crazy shenanigans all the more effective and hysterical. The showstopper, scene stealing, laugh riot Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and no wonder has her own sitcom and she should host or be apart of SNL or something she is so freaking funny I almost wet myself! Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig should make more comedies together and are much better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were in Baby Mama, they are a comedy dream team and the rest of the cast is the cherry on top. The movie goes through typical issues from the average chick flick like jealousy, insecurities, narcissism, cat fights, self-doubt, self-pity, self-destruction you name it but it deals with those is a more honest, realistic non sugar-coated way that was refreshing and smart from the norm and raises the bar so high for chick flicks (which is more anti of that anyways) and comedies in general that I personally can't see any comedy this year or in the future surpassing its comedy greatness, it's golden!!! Overall if you were waiting for a movie that will truly make you laugh harder than you ever laughed before in the theaters in a long time your wish has been granted, wear depends just in case because you might need them. Highly Recommended! The most satisfying comedy in the past decade that I never wanted it to end and forget about the overrated The Hangover and its unnecessary sequel and bring on Bridesmaids 2 already! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",2011
1,"I had to brace myself to sit through this Film, as I had read some reviews that actually had praised it, and it was a very long two hours to endure what has to be described as one of the most sleazy movies I have yet seen. The attempts at humor mostly concerned pooping/farting/belching and vomiting, so if that is anyone's idea of a comedy then this is for you! The Wedding shop bathroom scene was the most distasteful of a bad lot, while the Airplane sequence was so unbelievable and overlong, and the other so-called ""highlight"" was the ""hens' do"" that was so badly staged and overacted that the most predictable ending could not come quick enough! I was so sad to see such a great actress as Jill Clayburgh having to lower her standards to take a role in this disaster.",2013
5,"There should be a film classification which restricts admission to people UNDER a certain age. In the case of Bridesmaids it should be restricted to under fifteens.

Now, this might say more about how bad the other films of 2011 were, so I will be generous and not attribute the entire blame to the reviewers. After hearing how funny and ""unique"" this film supposedly is, I went out and rented it for a good laugh. No laughs. Lots of cringing embarrassment at how these women humiliate themselves. Awful stereotypes. Bad writing. Really unattractive protagonist. I mean that both in terms of personality and in terms of appearance. Wiig looks anorexic in this film, nearly getting lost in the bridesmaid dress she wears, AND what about her hair? (Sorry to be so superficial, but it bugged me throughout. I mean, COMB it already.) I found Chris O'Dowd charming, but it is as if he wandered into the wrong movie. And this was written by women? It is so insulting to women -- to the heavyset ""closet lesbian"" (as another reviewer called her) to the poor poor little rich girl Helen to the wacky mother who goes to AA for the social aspect etc etc. Please spend your precious viewing time on something else if you haven't already been hooked into watching this catastrophe by misguided critics or friends...",2011

3,"It is by far the worst movie I have seen this year. And I seriously do not understand why is it labeled as a comedy? 80% of the movie it is plain sad. A sad sad movie, about a girl who is miserable. She is lonely, broke, and is loosing her childhood best friend. Between a series of humiliating situations the director decided to add some jokes, or situational gags. I have to admit, a couple of them were funny. But apart from those, we get 2 hours and 10 minutes of a woman being miserable. She is more miserable than Dr. House during hist stay in the mental hospital and after Cuddy dumped him put together.",2011

I decided to check the user reviews before watching it and was very surprised by the amount of negative feedback. The reviews were almost hate posts! So, I put the disc in with mixed expectations and afterwards, I sat, glued to the credits thinking ""what was their problem?!"" Truly a beautiful film. Don't set out expecting an action packed bad-ass picture (I think that was the problem with most of the negative reviewers). Though not as frequent as your everyday action film, the action scenes are just as exciting as ever. If you liked the fighting techniques in Taken, imagine a teenage girl pulling off moves just as hardcore, if not more. The visuals and sounds of the film are nothing short of artistic. I give it an 8 out of ten. Not the best film of 2011, but definitely not the worst.",2011

The immoral CIA creates a program in which they are attempting to genetically create the perfect soldier by fooling with the DNA of embryos. When the experiment proves successful (huh..? Why shut down a successful program..?) it is decided for unknown reasons to end the project and terminate all those involved. Eric Bana, the CIA field agent who recruited the women for the experiment has a change of heart and tries to save one woman and her child. For no particular reason, except to give Hanna a reason to want revenge later on, the mother is killed by Kate Blanchett, and Eric Bana escapes with the infant. Bana raises Hanna as his own in an ""arctic"" cabin without electricity or modern conveniences, in order to prepare her for the day that she has to face the CIA and their henchmen. The day finally arrives when Hanna decides that she is ready. Bana digs up a transponder he had buried and places it in front of Hanna quipping that once the switch is flipped it can't be undone. Since there is no electricity in the cabin, and in fact Hanna has never seen an electric light, the method by which Bana got a battery to operate after over 14 years is never explained. Bana leaves Hanna alone to be captured by the dastardly CIA operatives. He did this apparently in order for Hanna to kill Kate Blanchett. Why he doesn't take Hanna with him, instead of leaving her to be taken by the CIA is left unexplained. Hanna is brought to an underground holding cell, the size of the Superbowl, in Morocco.",2011

1,"Contains spoilers: This film, Hanna, was god-awful. I was angry when I left the theatre after ruining my afternoon watching a film with such a stupid, faulty plot. There are just too many mistakes and holes. Hanna is a 16 year old ANOREXIC-LOOKING supposed genetic super human. Right away you know the casting is all wrong. She looks so weak. Sometimes she kills commandos immediately, and then other times she fights with skin-head caricatures for hours it seems. Silly stuff. To view this film's comments, use the ""hated it"" filter. I think the film's cast and backers shamelessly used IMDb.com for their selfish, untrue, and dishonest promotion of the film. No one with half a brain would recommend this film. There are plot holes which should anger you. Also, we are never told why she has to die or why the skinny little girl is a threat to US security. Why does she look longingly, lesbian-like into her new friend's eyes as they are lying in bed together? What happens to that girl and her family? We are not told. What did her foster-father ever do to deserve such treatment from her at the end? He then sacrifices his life for her! She has knowledge of everything in the world, but acts like one of the Beverly Hillbillies when it comes to turning on a light or using electric appliances, but then she just walks into a computer/coffee café and goes online. This is one of the dumbest films of all time. I was just so angry to have wasted my time and money on this film that was rated so highly on IMDb.

9,"Hannah is a wholly unexpected, but entirely enjoyable film. However, this is not the all out, balls to the wall action film the trailer might suggest. There is a high art house value to the film, and it takes it's time letting you get to know the characters, most notably the titular character Hannah, as she explores the world for the first time. What we have is the kind of action film that comes around every once in a while that values it's characters, but also demonstrates some great action pieces.",2011
8,"Hanna felt like The Little Engine That Could right from the start. When the trailer first started being shown in theaters, it looked to have potential while featuring a solid cast. But it felt like a smaller film that would leave a big impact once you finally got around to seeing it. There were a few things working against the film. I'm fairly certain that the only film of Joe Wright's that I've actually had the opportunity to sit down and watch is The Soloist. Despite being enjoyable, its weak online reputation along with movie critics less than stellar ratings and reviews imply that the film missed its mark. Speaking of missing its mark, Saoirse Ronan was also in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones which couldn't really decide what type of film to be and was more than a little disappointing overall. Luckily, Hanna doesn't suffer that same fate and we're actually given a film that is much stronger than it lets on.",2011
9,"A friend got me tickets to an advance screening, telling me it was a spy thriller with Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett. I hadn't seen a trailer and was expecting something along the lines of Mission Impossible. Was I wrong.",2011
6,"By an odd coincidence in the same year this film was released another film of a similar type came out, Columbiana.",2015
5,"I became interested in seeing Hanna because of the trailers. I am a fan of Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett also. I expected more than I got. It was good at first the set up with Hanna and her father; the bad lady chasing them. It was the usual super human person escaping harm through their strength and wits. I enjoyed the part when Hanna reaches the real world and the time she spends with regular people, especially a normal, annoying English teenager and her free spirit mother. But then the film deteriorates into one chase scene after another; one scene of stylized violence after another. After so much chasing and so much killing the ending becomes anti-climatic. 5/10",2011
1,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat, wanting to leave. I came looking for a suspense filled action movie. I got a little girl making her first friend. I unfortunately realized it was not going to get better too late to switch theaters. The plot was simple and worked well. A little girl is genetically altered to be a super soldier for the CIA. An agent with a heart of gold helps her Mom to escape with her. The Mom is killed during the escape and the agent raises the girl as his own. He trains her to get revenge on the woman who killed her Mom. Sounds good right? Lots of fights. The girl uncovers the truth of her genetic origins then gets the vengeance due her. No. That is too satisfying. She has to make a friend and learn how to live in a modern age. Her Dad trains her to kill but she is surprised by a light switch? How can you send your daughter to kill in Morocco then meet you in Germany but never prepare her for the 21st century. Somewhere Sarah Conner is weeping.",2011
1,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! I've opened an account on IMDb to warn you against this Film! It is a complete and utter waste of time. I don't know how it is scoring so highly on IMDb. The plot is ridiculous - we're not told why this girl poses a threat, what her Father did wrong, it doesn't explain why they had to split up only to meet at the same point again (couldn't they have got the bus together? LOL). The whole 'super human' business just doesn't wash, how can a skilled 'fighter' take out a soldier in one fell swoop and then struggle to fight against two skinheads? It doesn't make sense. Why on earth would the typical bad guy whistle a stupid tune when he is trying to find the girl? Hello..... whistling will give your location away! Why would you, if you are being followed (and you are a trained spy) make your way to an isolated underground car park type place? Why if you are trying to catch said spy, and there are 4 of you would you get involved in a hand to hand fight (which was poor by the way) - just shoot the guy, taser him, whatever - in the real world you would keep you distance! And then when the spy (the father) beats up the 4 agents he doesn't take the radio with him, he doesn't search them for weapons, it's just an insult to one's intelligence. There are so many holes in the plot it's almost laughable! None of it makes sense. Why does the grandmother get shot? She's been ignored for the last 16 years! Why would a trained super human spy be amazed/puzzled by a light, a TV, a kettle? And then she asks why she needs a bit of paper (her passport) to say who she is? Please do not waste your time with this film, it is nothing like the Bourne films or Leon (which some people seem to be comparing it with). This film is about a little girl, who's been stuck in the forest with her father for 16 years (and by the way, she doesn't even look 12, let alone 16!), finding her way in the big world beyond the forest. The film makers have tried to put a spin on this age old plot, but it just reduces the film to the pile of garbage that it is.",2011
1,"I can't decide which one is stupidest, between Hanna and Source Code. After many thoughts I think Hanna is. The topic was interesting (a young girl was raised by an ex-CIA agent in the mountains to become an assassin and fulfil a mission), but the stupid scenario, poor dialogue (the ""I just missed your heart"" amongst others), the clichés, the way how it was directed and most of the music and soundtrack were ABSOLUTE rubbish. Below are some examples (and believe me there are lots!) of the ridiculous, laughable and stupid moments in the film: - She was imprisoned in a CIA cell located in the desert of Morocco which incredibly looks like the southwest of the USA - After shooting a few CIA agents, her face was covered with blood. The whole scene when she escaped from that CIA location gave me a headache because of the way it was filmed and the techno music (the post production probably wanted to re-create a cool-stylish-ish effect a la Matrix but they pathetically failed) - Hanna has no money yet was able to send a postcard to her father somewhere in Europe (how did she know how to buy a postcard and walk to the post office? She spent her life in the mountains, remember? Besides she had 0 money...) - Hanna was raised all her life in the mountains. She had never seen a TV or had electricity, yet she was able to walk into an internet café and surf the web to look for information about DNA I could go on for hours, but I'll stop here. The movie is rubbish, the scenario is rubbish, the dialogues are rubbish and the music is rubbish. I don't understand what worldwide famous actors such as Eric Bana and Cate Blanchet are doing in this failure",2011

1,"OK, so you've got 16 year old girl who is a genetically altered super soldier. She has spent her entire life training in combat, stealth, etc., basically she is a bad-ass (which she proves right off the bat when she kills like half a dozen soldiers and escapes from a highly secure government facility). So why does she spend a large part of the movie running from two skin-heads and a 5 foot tall psychopath in a tennis outfit? It makes no sense she could have easily killed them all. Which she proves when they catch up to her and she quickly kills one of the skin-heads without even breaking a sweat, then she runs away from the other (unarmed) skin-head and the psycho in the tennis shorts. She could have just killed all three right then and been done with it. As if that wasn't bad enough later in the movie Hannah and her father are together. Her father being the man who trained her (and the man who earlier in the filmed killed like five armed men with his bare hands). The (still unarmed) skin-head and the (also unarmed) psychopath show up along with the very woman who it is Hannah's mission in life to kill. So, do the two of them quickly and easily dispatch their foes and then go out for ice cream? No, they split up and run. Yes they both run from people that either one of them could have easily killed on their own much less together. The whole thing was just ridiculous. Throw in a bunch ""artistic imagery"" and a whole bunch of useless subtext and you have 111 minutes of your life you will never get back. Take my word for it, skip this one.",2011
5,"Saoirse Ronan is a unique young actress in that all her films so far are very unusual. We knew her first in ""Atonement"", then in the ""The Lovely Bones"", both dark dramas that got Oscar Award consideration. We see a new Saoirse here in ""Hanna"" as this wan, frail-looking lass as a kick-ass cold-blooded assassin.",2011
1,"This was definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't understand how people can write praising reviews at the same time they say that the characters weren't developed, the plot had many unclear points (like most of it). In fact I came onto the IMDb website to see if I could find out why these people were doing what they were doing, which was mostly beating each other up and killing gruesomely.",2011
1,"Based on the rating one would be forgiven for expecting a film that first made sens and second was actually good. I was looking forward to seeing this but after watching it wish I had not wasted my time. The whole thing was too daft and over convoluted for words. Hanna started in the Arctic, got captured and ended up in Morocco, escaped to Spain and then to Germany. This without the faintest idea what to do with a light switch, telephone or annoying TV programme. But of course she was able to first, find a place with a computer and second, use one proficiently enough to extract information from. Seemed odd she was freaked out by a light switch but knew what a computer was. Also her fighting skills against trained soldiers was stunning but she was not very well trained in warding off skinheads in the employ of a whistling dwarf in a tracksuit. What Cate Blanchett was doing and why was difficult to understand and the plot revelations were never really exploited very well. It had the makings of a good film but was too stupid to actually make the grade. If this was Eric Bana's plan to kill his nemesis it assumed a lot of things would go Hanna's way for her to complete her Mission Impossible. Especially as she was unable to even turn on a light. Her escape was utterly silly and became sillier when she hooked up with the family in the camper van. Very little of the actions of anybody in the film made that much sense and the story made even less. The reviews here written by those who worked for the production team ensure that the film feels worth watching but best start at the hated it and work upwards for a sense of what the film is really like. Another promising movie that failed miserably. Thankfully I saw 'Paul' the same day and that made up for watching Hanna. Hopefully 'Super 8' will be more 'Paul' than 'Hanna'.",2011
9,"This show has it all- two hard-as-nails, but flawed protagonists, sleazy politicians, a slick railroad tycoon staying one step ahead of the legalities, grit, sex, humor, and of course, the Fair Haired Maiden of the West. The characters are deep and intense, although occasionally caricatured to the point of cartoonish. Their is something of a realism to their good-bad pendulum: the good guys are mostly good, but show some real bad, too. The bad guys are cursed with feelings and emotions that are sometimes fragile. They elicit something close to sympathy.",2012
9,"I Love this show. Best I've seen in a long time. I had no interest in a following a western, in fact was put of by genera, but decided to give it a try anyway as the trailers seemed pretty good.",2012
9,"Just one word...Beautiful! I'm from the Netherlands and thanks to IMDb I started watching. And was hooked from the start. It reminds me of the comics Comanche, Durango and Blueberry of Flemish authors Greg and Hermann. The classic western tale not sparing us the harsh reality of racism, bloodshed for personal gain and 'immorality'. Even the cinematography is comicbooklike. Especially Cullen reminds of the character Red Dust in the comicbook Comanche. Very interesting characters all in all. My favourite (they're all my favourite, but i love this one) is the The Sweed. What a smooth yet chilling personalty!! They (casting) couldn't have done a better job with him.",2011

9,"After Deadwood (HBO)stopped being aired I was DEVASTATED. I love watching the ""modern"" western. When I saw that AMC had a new series Hell on Wheels I watched the first episode and wasn't so sure I'd like it. I was torn with a few of the characters and wasn't sure things meshed together but I watched the second episode and by the 3rd I was hooked! I just finished the season and am DYING for next season to get started. Some of the scenery is breathtaking and the musical score during the Indian battle with Cullen, Elam and the Union soldiers (when the Indians stole their horses) was absolutely mesmerizing. I think it's a great show and will only improve with time!! I'm a fan. For sure.",2012
10,"And that is a lot for me to say because I think Breaking Bad is the second best TV show ever, right after the Wire. Me and my wife both love this show, and it leads to great conversations after each episode, about American history, bible stories, western movies, why bohannon is such an attractive man, whatever. I think the show ran the risk of taking on way too much subject matter early on in the show (a common mistake in dramas nowadays), but they still include enough character development and detail to make the environment intimate and real, while still plowing through their dozen or more plot threads. I just hope AMC realizes that they are going to have to continue spending money on this show to keep it good, and that they don't slash the budget like they did Walking Dead (which pretty much stagnated that show).",2012
9,"As a fan of other AMC series, I looked forward to Hell On Wheels. I had no idea what to expect, except that there were trains involved. My Dad and I watched the first two episodes this week. Both of us were blown away with the production value of this show. We were immediately fixed to the screen as a man is shot to death in a church confessional. The juxtaposition in imagery of the tough looking killer and the stained glass in the first scene will capture you. H.O.W. doesn't move too fast, and you don't have to be fascinated with trains or the west to enjoy this show. The writing is quality and the cinematography is great! As to avoid spoilers, I will just say I am eager to see what happens this Sunday. Give it a chance, it's available OnDemand in HD",2011
10,"I have watched TV westerns since the mid 1950s, and, after five episodes I can state categorically ""Hell on Wheels"" is the best I have seen.

4,"Hell on Wheels begins as an intriguing drama but falls apart half way through the first season. It's not enough to have a good idea for a drama, the key is to have worthwhile characters. No character on this show deserves sympathy or praise. Our main character is one-dimensional and hasn't grown. Other characters are archetypes and don't comment on America at the time. Story lines are thin and come and go. SPOILER ALERT: one does not simply kill off a character and bring him back. That is a death sentence in writing. You're bound to drive your audience to self-castration. Not only that, but consider if you show a primary character being brutally injured (say, an arrow wound to the forearm)and continue the series never mentioning it again, you are lying to your audience. I can understand a continuity error, but not a catastrophic one. ",2012
1,"Hell on Wheels is a remake of 99% of the same shows being made by Hollywood today.

The location scouts and set designers deserve a lot of praise.",2012
3,The story line started out decent and went downhill fast. ,2011
2,"Deadwood, produced by HBO, which has a track record for intelligent groundbreaking series, showed that there was yet still life in the Western. OK, so the oh-so-knowing 21st century wanted grit and realism whereas before the punter had settled docilely for the good guys in white hats and the bad guys in black hats and honourable men won and were rewarded with the true love of respectable (and usually heavily made-up) woman, but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing: we've had the fantasy, now give us the reality. But Deadwood was good - no, make that great - because it had intelligent scripts, good direction, great actors and vision. But as usual the money men who know a good thing when they see a good thing took the superficial and discarded the intelligence and what they came up with is Hell On Wheels. I am astounded the the overall IMDb rating (at the time of writing) is 8.2. That means that a lot of people think this is 'good'. It is nothing of the kind. It is two-dimensional, cartoonish and thoroughly unsatisfying. It is an MTV western with MTV photography, MTV acting and MTV direction. It is the TV equivalent of fast food. It is cack. It is candyfloss. There is no thought and no wit. If you liked and appreciated Deadwood, give this a miss. If you like this, cross me off your Christmas card list because you and I have absolutely nothing in common.",2013
10,"This show has it all, great cast and producers. From the beginning I was on the edge of my seat. The music is awesome, after ever episode you just can't wait for the next one and the next, more and more. My favorite character is Cullen Bohannon played by the great Anson Mount. It gives you a sense of how it was back then. It truly was Hell on wheels. It's raw and unforgiving times, when you watch this show you can't help but wonder this is just the way it was and how it happened. The actors really go well and the writing is on spot. Expect allot of awards for this show. AMC has done it again, my hats off to you gentleman. This show should go for another 10 seasons without a doubt. Thank you AMC #Season5?...0_0",2014
10,"Well first, I don't like things easily. This TV show is going on since 2011 and they are preparing to introduce their fourth season. In this show maybe you claim ""Things proceed slowly"" but after you get used to Hell on Wheels, you see you addicted to show. Somehow the show take over you with top class acting of Anson Mount and the others. If you love bad guys but also like good guys and can't decide which side is more closer to you, you gonna love this. Everybody in this show get their awards, the good guys, the bad guys all of them. They are equally in trouble and that's a lot of trouble I mean, that's the beauty of Hell on Wheels. First season is little bit slow I accept that but each episode is more interesting and breathtaking than previous episode. Mentality is; If I going down they coming with me. Lots of epic characteristics especially The Swede(C. Heyerdahl). They're all in one war, everybody wants to win but the truth is only one man gonna win and the others knew about it. Thrill is certainly high, any moment something can go wrong. If you watch this, you say like this: ""I NEED MORE HELL ON WHEELS""",2014

By watching the teasers and trailers, the scenery, the premise, and the overall graphic treatment was attractive enough to get a western fan interested, at least it was in my opinion.",2011
10,"I have been watching ""Hell on Wheels"" since it started and I'm also hooked. I love all the characters (especially Cullen and Elam, Eva and Lily Bell). The actor who plays Durant is perfect for his role. There is heartbreak and love, action and adventure. Many times they say things without speaking, just by the look on the actor's face (excellent actors all). The director and creators have made the best story I have ever seen. The whole story is so real. I love the music that goes so perfectly with what is happening. Whoever thought of the songs is a genius! This show is the most excellent show on T.V. I hate reality shows and hardly watch anything on T.V. (except good movies when they're on), but this show is the best I have ever seen!",2012

One Washington Post reviewer described Colm Meany as chewing the scenery, but there's only so much the best actor can do with bad writing. Subsequent episodes are better, although this is certainly not Deadwood or even close. At first, it seemed like a mash-up of The Outlaw Josie Wales, Deadwood, and bits and pieces of dozen westerns other reviewers have mentioned. It's not exactly new news that life was brutal in the nineteenth century American west, so why anyone would think this makes the series innovative, I have no idea.",2011

I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film.

If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it!

Seriously, I don't know how anyone could watch this and think it wasn't at the very least, a Very Good movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and its also more realistic the most fighting movies.

Was it just another MMA movie with over the top hardcore action? Well lets find out.",2011
10,"""Warrior"" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing ""Miracle"" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In ""Warrior"" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. ""Warrior"" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.",2011
10,Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.,2012
6,"A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not.",2012
10,"As a teenager, I'm definitely inexperienced in the world of MMA. But this movie is not about MMA, and that is set very clear from the start. Right from the start of the 2 minute trailer. So naturally I was ecstatic to take my seat in the theater.",2011
1,"OK, actually this is a decent sports drama, and I would rate it 6.5-7 if it wasn't for an utterly horrifying plot element that seems to have escaped most people: The main hero of the story is forced into foreclosure of his home by an arrogant banker who weaseled him into his loan in the first place, and now refuses to extend it. His only way out is to participate in a no-holds-barred fight tournament organized and financed by - an arrogant Wall Street banker! Just how sick is that? The people who force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy get the additional kick of watching said Americans get their heads bashed in - and be grateful for the wads of cash they may receive if they make it. Exactly like 'Hunger Games', only there it's criticized and in a SciFi setting, whereas 'Warrior' glorifies this state of things and is set in the present day! Almost as if the US today were some sort of Ancient Rome, where the impoverished should be thankful for their chance to prove their merit in the arena like the gladiators of yore.",2012
1,"this movie absolutely sucks! the whole plot, the clichés! I just do not understand how this movie got such a high rating! The movie has such a dumb storyline! I am wondering if people are giving it a high rating because of the popularity of MMA? The whole movie is just so full of unrealistic possibilities. From the AWAL Marine who becomes a hero on his way out from IRAQ,who all of a sudden becomes an MMA killer? to the moonlighting Teacher who beats down an undefeated MMA fighter? or How about the two brothers fighting each other for the finale? what are the odds of that happening? I am usually not such a hard critic but the unrealistic high rating made me post this. Please people please rate this movie correctly and not just on MMA Scenes. I would never watch this movie again! I think people should re rate this movie once they clearly see how boring and unrealistic this movie is!",2012
2,"First off - great camera-work, hence the 2. Now for the core of the movie - brother vs brother is a fun plot that can be twisted every which way. However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but ""all-in"" attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900's, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the ""warrior"".

3,How this film got 8/10 stars is beyond me. They meet on the beach at night for a tête-à-tête? Puhleez. The music is overblown and sappy. The fight scenes are absurd. Nolte reads from a script that is nothing but a chain of clichés.,2012

1,"This movie is something new. Everything was so unpredictable, fights, tournament and what an end, totally unexpected, two brothers in the final. What a story!!! Really, I think this film is in top 10, no top 5, worst sport-drama movies in last decade. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your time and money on this film. It is absolute mystery how Warrior reached 8.3 on IMDb. It should be in best case 5, so that people know that they cannot expect any intellectual challenge. So, I guess this is a movie for Ultimate fight fans, because that is the only that it can offer, fight scenes (pumped and not realistic). And believe, this has nothing with a fact that I am a female. I watched Warrior with my brother and husband, both of them shared my opinion. Nothing new, full of stereotypes. OK, I will admit one bright spot.

8,"The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission: Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone, who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofa-hopping TV antics, and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to £75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs (2007), Valkyrie (2008), and Knight and Day (2010) failing to impress at the box office, while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office, attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his well-disguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008) in which he plays a the foul-mouthed, hot-headed, half-bald studio executive. But, every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front, Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.",2011
4,"I for the life of me cannot understand all the positive reviews for this film . The action was OK , the plot was completely non-existent as was the villain. Personally the first mission impossible remains the strongest in my view and the 3rd in the series whilst being far from a classic was passable mainly due to Phillip Seymour Hoffman (I will not mention the second for obvious reasons!!).

10,"I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise as a person and that sometimes influences my opinion on a film. Even with this point in the back of my mind I must say that Tom Cruise still got it. He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think of trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going to be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission: Impossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations are mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are cool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to see this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I haven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great decision. The best action film in years.",2011

This is hands-down the best action film this year, boasting some of the most exhilarating action ever captured in a long while. It also restores Tom Cruise's marquee value as an action star, and we dare attest that any naysayer to Cruise's ability to resurrect the franchise he almost drowned will be silenced once they see what he does on screen.",2011
8,"This fourth entry breathes fresh life into the Mission: Impossible film Franchise. The original 1996 Mission: Impossible was a promising start, and now 15 Years and four films later, I'm happy to say that Tom Cruise has still got it. This franchise - unlike most these days - has still got its edge, and isn't showing any signs of losing it or wearing down. I could definitely see another episode being produced in the future. And we have Tom Cruise to thank for all of that... because he is, after all, the man who has carried these films. Cruise has not only starred in them all, but he has also been very involved on the development and production end, receiving billing as co-producer on all installments. Overall, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL offers lighter adventure - perhaps on a bigger scale than any of the previous films - and also features a stellar ensemble cast, and some of the best popcorn entertainment in a while. ",2012
1,Easily the worst in the MI franchise. It's movies like this that make me wonder how movies ever get made. The story is a badly regurgitated Cold War plot that requires the ghosted IMF team to stop a Russian physicist trained in special forces martial arts from acquiring nuke launch codes and starting Armageddon.,2012

9,"Is there anything Brad Bird can't do? Interest was certainly high when it was announced that the animation director would be making his live- action directing debut, choosing to tackle the third sequel in the Mission: Impossible film series. Brian De Palma's first, while it hasn't aged well, is a tense 70s style thriller, John Woo's M:I 2 increased the action but lowered the intelligence, and in 2006 JJ Abrams reinvigorated the franchise with the exciting and highly enjoyable M:I 3. But all of the previous films have been completely left in the dust by Bird's Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, a strong contender for film of the year and perhaps one of the finest action films ever made. To have pulled off such a feat is somewhat remarkable for Bird. While certainly an immensely talented director (best known for The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, two films which would rank highly on any respectable list of greatest animated movies of all time), the ability to transfer his skills to live-action on the scale of M:I – GP with such flair sets him apart as a filmmaker with immeasurable gifts, and one of the most interesting directors working today.",2011
1,"In the way of movies - MI4 Ghost Protocol is another in a long line of let's fill up the screen with as much crap as we can . Busy does not mean good - it's boring. The same jump off a rooftop, car chases, crashes , fights , etc etc etc. MI4 tries so hard to take itself seriously but instead ends up one long car chase so to speak. Tom Cruise does his usual look at me I'm trying to be cool act which is about the same thing he does in every one of his movies. His team of agents also does the we look cool so watch us do these cool things . The plot if there is one about the Kremlin being blown up is boring - I fell asleep halfway through and wanted to just go home. The backers of this series are beating a dead horse trying to milk whatever else they can get out of it no matter how bad the script is or how long in the tooth Cruise gets . Sad thing is ,this movie will make money because Cruise's name is attached to it. Too many fanboys out there who don't care if a movie sucks as long as their boy or girl is in it will plunk down the bucks to see it over and over. 1/10 -Bomb",2012

3,"A good director could have salvaged the barely-there script of this movie and made a tight action film, that thrills even when the plot is non-existent and the characters weak. But sadly, Tom chose the wrong director. Brad Bird may do very well with animation and comedy but an action film director he's not. He clearly cannot create the tension or pace that keeps such a film going. Threads were falling by, new plots were introduced every half an hour, and no character (including Ethan Hunt) seemed motivated or compelling enough. Not to mention, the complete absence (maybe other than the Dubai skyscraper scene) of any edge-of-the-seat action. It was all so pedestrian.",2011

And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film.

10,"What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.  1. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one, alone,  would have made the movie terrific, but together? Forgetaboutit! Every  step of the way, every scene, every emotion, these two men own the  movie and watching their bromance is a treat from start to finish. Make  no mistake about it, even when the world is on the brink of utter  destruction what really matters is how these two men relate to one  another. And when you watch the movie, you will care.  2. Everyone in the cast is good. Kevin Bacon has never been better, and  Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful. Rose Byrne and January Jones aren't  given much to do, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside only have a few short  lines, but - across the board - the entire cast are a delight.  3. The story is tight. You've got a bad guy with a plan, which he sets  about executing in A/B/C fashion. Against him, the good guys work  together. Their motivations are different, of course, but they pretty  much want him stopped so they unite. That's it.  4. Charles and Erik are fascinating characters. They debate. And  viewers can debate endless about them, and about who is right, etc. As  you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you  understand why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these  early days, don't understand it yet. To have that so perfectly captured  in a Summer Blockbuster movie is part of what makes this a treat and a  future classic. But, aside from their relationship to each other, the  movie takes time to make each of them interesting in his own right. We  get to see Charles as a teacher, for instance, and come to understand  how he impacts upon the lives of those he tutors. Some of Erik's best  moments (away from Charles) are in his comments to Mystique about her  appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than the  shadow of his past.  4. Most supporting characters have very little screen time. But that's  okay, since this isn't THEIR story, really. Of the bunch, it is  Mystique and Beast who are best served. Both have terrific character  arcs that - in a lesser X-Men movie - might have been the highlight of  the film. Here, their stories serve as quality background material to  the main event (Charles and Erik). Beyond that, we just learn enough  about everyone to know what they can do and like them a little bit,  mostly through their banter and most obvious character traits. Once  scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly terrified  will certainly go a long way towards making you care about them for the  rest of the movie. On the downside: Shaw's two henchmen don't get  ANYTHING to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we  know as much about Emma Frost as we did at the beginning. But these are  the exception, not the rule.  5. Visually, this movie is a treat. The FX are good, no surprise, but -  much better - the actual sets/costumes are beautiful. Whether it's a  remote CIA lab or a lap-dance club, whether it's the Magneto helmet or  Mystique's everyday clothes, you are always admiring 'the look' of  what's on screen.  6. There are action scenes all during the movie, but - having said that  - the movie builds as it goes. The first half is more  story-heavy/character-heavy so that when the action REALLY starts we  care about everyone. And, again, it works. Even with the scant details  given their characters, when Banshee and Havok (for example) go into  battle you are invested in them to a certain degree.  7. There are surprises. Deaths, betrayals, cameos and name-dropping.  But, as well as being cool, all of this makes perfect sense for the  story/universe of the movies.  Superb! Rock-solid script, two amazing lead performances (the film is  basically a bromance). Haven't been this excited about the X-Men  franchise since X2: X-Men United.",2011
8,"Beginning with a crime-thriller and a fantasy film on his directorial résumé, it is safe to say that Matthew Vaughn may have already found his niche genre in the super-hero field despite only directing four films in seven years. His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.",2011

X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that.

The first two films made the superhero genre what it is today. Stunning set pieces, breath taking special effects and a group dynamic that was brilliantly cemented in the second film. The third struck a middle ground where the spectacle overshadowed the narrative but was still a fun ride, and the last title Xmen Origins: Wolverine, was the only miss-step in the series. Xmen first Class is really very good. It manages to keep up with the first two whilst retaining an originality in its own right.",2011

Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people.

10,"You might hear one comparing this to a Tarantino film, but leave all worries at the door, this is an absorbing and tremendously unique piece of cinema from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn. The reason it works so exquisitely well is because the film grabs hold of you and takes you inside this often dark and dream-like LA setting. So, when the end of the film hits, you feel apart of this film, and it's there to stay.",2011

9,"I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men, including myself, neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that, i'm not really keen on the subject, or it's actors for that matter. But film by film, this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.",2011

6,"Wow!! Did I miss something here? The biggest drawback of this movie is the plot: it's barely believable and lacking in substance. While the soundtrack is very good, it also cannot save the weak dialogue which is mostly Ryan Gosling staring at people and things and not saying much at all -- we're supposed to think that's really cool. He also likes to wear that scorpion jacket even when it's been bloodied. Becoming best buddies with the neighbor's kid on the first try - really? And then willing to risk his life even after the neighbor's boyfriend comes back from prison even though she previously hit on him - really? Also, outsmarting a police helicopter in LA in the first chase scene - really?",2011

4,"First the good: Drive is cast with excellent actors. Now for the bad. Based on this picture you would not know that most of the cast could act at all. Gosling's performance makes wooden seem lifelike. This must be due to direction because Gosling has been in several recent pictures and has acted up a storm in all of them. Gosling, Mulligan, Cranston, Brooks, and Hendricks are all interesting, accomplished actors. My question is: how did they get sucked into this horrible picture? Either the script that was shot was different from the script they read, or they had guns pointed at their heads.",2011

Driver is a mechanic/stunt driver,who lives in los Angeles.he has a very mysterious background no one really knows where he came from or who he really is. He meets this woman who lives in the same apartment building, he becomes really close to her and her son. The relationship between them becomes strained when her husband gets out of prison. driver witnesses her husband being beat up and tries to help him. he is the get away driver for the guy. unknowingly he gets involved with the mob. After a lot of killing and running away driver finally kills the leader of this group. In the end he drives out into the sunset all alone and bleeding. The director Nicolas Winding Refn did a fantastic job at telling the story in this movie.

Overall this is a really good movie and everyone should see it!",2012
8,"Something about Ryan Gosling caught my eye when I first saw him in ""Murder by Numbers"". Opposite Sandra Bullock, I was heavily mistaken for underestimating this relatively new actor. After ""Fracture"", Gosling had my full attention. Not only did he refuse to be outdone by the legendary Anthony Hopkins, Gosling vindicated his star power as an up and coming actor with some serious screen charisma. With ""Drive"", Gosling smashes it out of the park. The best part? He doesn't even say much in the movie but gets it done through sheer screen presence. ",2012
10,"OK, all of you fans of Downton Abbey, I have found an even better show: ""Gran Hotel"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2006421/ It is so addictive and wonderful you forget you are reading subtitles and begin craving each new episode. Yon González is the sexy Spanish young Matt Dillon. Llorenç González is the Spanish Jake Gyllenhaal. I just love everyone in this show. The connection between the leads is palpable and I am always lost in their dilemma. This may be my favorite series ever! I get it, the Spanish win the telenovela.",2014
10,"This is one addictive show! It grabs you from the start, thanks in particular to the charismatic leads, Amaia Salamanca, who plays Alicia and Yon González, who plays Julio. The other actors are also compelling and excellent; the location, a beautiful old Spanish estate on the water, is glorious; the costumes are a delight; the scenes of old Spanish towns, with cobblestone streets and lanes lighted by torches, are wonderfully atmospheric! The plot swings from some truly touching moments to flights of operatic grandeur but it is the love story of Julio and Alicia that keeps the whole thing grounded and keeps you glued to the screen. Awesome!",2014
10,"THE best series I've seen in a long time. Gran Hotel just DRIPS in passion, mystery, clever twists, dreamy costuming, authentic stagecraft, and a music score unparalleled in current television. It's Downton Abby and Upstairs, Downstairs on steroids, with brilliant cleverness! The ruthlessness of the family and insiders rivals The Tudors and Deadwood, but no sex (YAY), no cussing (YAY), no violence except occasional slapping and bullet-holes (YAY, no graphic violence), and no CGI (YAY). And all of this is wrapped in an amazingly-tight script with the talented actors rapid=firing Spanish to one another while we, as viewers, are stunned at the beautiful actors, underlying mystery, clever twists, dreamy costumes (impeccable linen, silk, cotton, and wool!), gorgeous outdoor/indoor scenes, heart-throbbing music, and engaging acting! Season 1 and 2 come with subtitles so turn them on and ENJOY! BONUS: Spanish language lessons for those of us who might remember third-year Spanish. Lo siento, de nada, pero, por favor give us more!! Just dreamy!",2014
8,"Fun Spanish series, which owes quite a lot to ""Downton Abbey"". Great villains (almost everyone is morally dubious at some point), interesting characters and a nicely twisty plot line, with emotion, suspense and humor all mixed in. With slight reservations over to the number of people who found themselves lurking in exactly the right place at the right time and the fact that the hero never actually seemed to do any work, we really enjoyed the whole thing....until the last 5 minutes of the last episode which were (a) inexplicable (b) unexplained and (c) a real letdown. However, don't let this detract from the other 30 odd hours of entertainment. Thoroughly enjoyable and borderline addictive.",2014
10,"Addictive indeed! The kind of series that lends itself to binge-watching. I fell in love with the hotel, the characters, the actors (Von Gonzalez, where have you been all my life?) and the twists and turns of the storyline. ",2014
10,"An excellent drama, full of romance, murder, mystery and mayhem. Although some suspension of disbelief is required for some parts (eg following people and not being seen), it is well written and acted enough that it does not impact and I am truly hooked. It is compelling and one of the best things on TV at present. To say it is the Spanish Downton abbey does it a disservice, as this is so much imore with all the intrigue involved. ",2014
10,"Gran Hotel is an amazing TV show, that contains all the right elements in perfect balance: Mystery, drama and comedy. I have concluded watching all the episodes, and I was impressed by the fast pace of the most of the original 75-min episodes. The pilot episode can make even the most demanding viewer addicted. I had never watched a Spanish TV show, and I decided to give it a try. And I was instantly hooked, I remember my face when the first episode finished. I was amazed. The script is fantastic, the most characters on the show are unique and unforgettable, the actors that are playing them are top, the costumes are well made and the mysterious scenery is breathtaking! The direction is exactly what this series needs. As many of the viewers, I thought that Gran Hotel would be an imitation of the Downton Abbey. I'm glad I was wrong, it is one hundred times better. If you have the chance, simply watch the first episode. I guarantee that you will not move your eyes from TV!",2015
8,"Out of curiosity I watched an episode on Netfilx and immediately fell in love with the series. The cinematography, acting, costume, location all was most beautifully and convincingly done. The story line is wonderful, and the sexual tension and connection between the romantic leads just draws you in. Some of the story lines carried on a bit (there are a Lot of episodes) and I felt that they sometimes took a turn that was too much out of character, It's wonderfully cast and there is a new standard for portraying simmering evil! the leading couple stayed magnetic and now can't wait for the final season 3! A beautiful period piece.",2014

10,"It is rather refreshing to see that good taste has not gone down the toilet drain where many recent series (Banshee comes to mind) should have never emerged from. This series is a pleasure to watch. Everything about it is simply charming, captivating. The plot, the characters, the directing and the acting, the location, the costumes, you name it. Adriana Ozores' vocalization is so good that many times the English subtitles are not needed. Concha Velasco and Lluis Homar complete the luxury triad of top veteran leading actors. Their younger counterparts also deliver convincing and elegant acting. All in all, the series feels more British than Spanish and one can find elements from Downton Abbey, Ripper Street and even Harry Potter. I've only just watched S1E1 but look forward to the many more episodes to come. Highly recommendable.",2014
9,"Gran Hotel has it all; gorgeous historical drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, even a serial killer. Yes, it's a bit over the top but I couldn't get enough and wish there was more. I am Spanish so speak the language but since I was born here I often needed to refer to the subtitles which was a bit annoying because I didn't want to tear my eyes away from the action. So, I understand the hesitance to watch a subtitled show but it is worth it! If you love shows like Downton Abbey or The Paradise, Watch the first episode of Gran Hotel and you will be hooked...ENJOY! P.S. This is a show made in Spain, not to be confused with ""The Grand"" which was a very good British variation, but not as good as ""Gran Hotel"".",2014
10,"Alicia, Julio, Teresa, Diego, Andres, Angela, Sofia, Alfredo, Inspector Ayala--these are some of the characters that will grab your attention, and hold it for the 42 episodes that are on Netflix. The Spanish subtitled series is filled with mystery, intrigue, suspense, and romance. The episodes take place in the early 20th century, at the luxurious ""Gran Hotel"", where the lives of the owners and employees are cleverly interwoven. The soap-opera style series is filled with overheard conversations that provoke suspicions and actions that make each 45 minute episode move quickly, and often end with a cliff-hanger, tempting you to quickly move on to the next one. There are so many coincidental overheard conversations, as the characters move through the corridors of the hotel, that you recognize the writers' tongue-in-cheek humor that is cleverly inserted, which makes for some lighter moments in the drama. Excellent acting, great period costumes, and interesting plot line will keep you involved with a great cast until the resounding finale. Watch them all--you'll love it",2014

8,"Let me start by saying I must be one of the few women who don't usually watch soap operas, especially when they deal with the by-now-tiresome, antiquated, melodramatic theme of ""love among the social classes."" Having said that, I find this (1st season) of Gran Hotel extremely entertaining. It's a whodunit set in 1905 Spain. A young girl who works at the posh Gran Hotel is murdered. Her brother arrives to the place to find out what happened to her. That is the central theme. What I like about it is that it is very fast-paced. Definitely keeps your attention. The subplots only contribute to make the story more interesting.",2014
5,SPOILERS AHEAD,2015
9,"I immediately got hooked on this show despite having to read all the dialog. I have binge-watched 5 episodes once. It is so great. The costumes, the backdrop are amazing. The location itself is a character. I am glad to know that there are more episodes not yet on Netflix because I was stunned by the last episode (#42) on the Netflix list.",2014
9,"I don't have much to add to the other reviews, except that most of what I found hard to swallow occurred during the first season, aside from the unintentionally funny habit of characters implausibly appearing exactly at the right time, but since that tended to move the story along it wasn't so bad. There is also a certain character that keeps improbably turning up like a bad penny, but let that pass. Other than that, this is a really engaging story that seems to have been thought out in advance, so the writers never paint themselves into corners, run out of steam, or rely on absurd plot twists. Of course, I haven't seen all of the episodes because the secret of obtaining them is a mystery worthy of the show itself. Altogether this show is so well done that it's easy to lose yourself in it.",2014
10,"I must say I watched this series through all 3 series without watching anything else until I finished it. It is full of flaws and things you could pick fault with but that does not attract from the enjoyment. It is visually stunning and totally engrossing, and very much like a great page turner. I haven't enjoyed a series as much as this for a long time. The series is set in the north of Spain in a visually stunning hotel overlooking the ocean, and resolves primarily around the love of a young waiter and the daughter of the now deceased owner of the hotel. Despite their total devotion to each other they cannot be together because the daughter is married to the manager of the hotel who has a dark past of his own that gradually unfolds as the story progresses. There are however many subplots involving other members if the daughter's family and an eccentric detective and his not so bright side kick. Gran Hotel really is a bit like a cross between Downton Abbey and Days of Our Lives on steroids but maybe that doesn't really do it justice. The series is in Spanish of course but the English subtitles are really well done and do not detract from the enjoyment of this wonderful series.",2016
10,"Well, I think that only one word is able to describe this TV series: ""MASTERPIECE"". Gran Hotel satisfies all tastes! It combines everything: mystery, drama, agony, suspense, romance & a good sense of humor!Each episode is better than the previous one! And... as far as the actor's performances is concerned, this show will remind you of Hollywood actor's performances. It's obvious that every character has been so carefully created,you will love everyone of them and yes...there will be times when you'll even commiserate with the villains. Now, when it comes to romance it's rather the trite relationship between a servant & a lady. On the contrary, it's something so special, so beautiful, so real that has been achieved thanks to the incredible chemistry between Yon Gonzalez (Julio) and Amaia Salamanca (Alicia)! Watching this TV series literally travels you to the 20th century, feeling like you are there ,in the Gran Hotel, when all these murders & mysteries occur, when secrets are revealed! So many emotions in every episode! Even the most demanding viewer will be addicted from the 1st episode! As far as the end is concerned I only need to tell you that the final episode was my favorite! :) P.S If I could, I would have rated with 1000 out of 10!",2016
9,"Take Downton Abbey, mix in a little Poirot, some Midsomer Murders and maybe a little Agatha Christie and then add some impossibly handsome and beautiful cast members. Finish with a plot that cracks along and you have Gran Hotel! My wife and I are totally hooked and watching the box sets furiously. The chemistry between the leads is fabulous and there is a sense of humour working in the background. Yes you know what is going to happen but it is all part of the fun. Quote simply one of the best period dramas ever! We are soon starting on season 3. Huge congratulations to the wonderful cast and production crew. The evil doings of the Alarcon family will take your breath away. Agent Ayala and his hapless assistant Hernando are great fun and provide comic relief. Unmissable!",2015
10,"It was having a quiet Sunday evening in watching TV. I was scanning channels for something different to watch and found episode 1 of season 3 of Grand Hotel. I was watching with interest as the beautiful senorita Alicia was kidnapped and held captive. Her husband Diego, concerned for her safety, taking matters in to his own hands making a rescue attempt. At the same time Alicia's lover, Julio, and her long time friend Maite were also searching for her, along with the insightful Inspector Ayala. After watching the conclusion of this episode I was thoroughly hooked on this new show and had to download seasons 1 and 2 and start watching from the very beginning. The characters in the program are very intriguing and fun to watch as their lives revolve around the hotel. Thoroughly entertaining program, the only downside is the speed at which they recite their dialog. With the program translated in to English I found myself pressing the pause button and rewinding the recording to catchup on a translation I missed.",2015
2,"Horribly contorted story lines that make no sense whatsoever, offered up for effect alone and arising out of nothing. Worse than a highly melodramatic afternoon soap opera. You've got to feel sorry for these actors who are slaves to the contrived and illogical twists and turns of what passes for a ""plot."" To a person though, they are all fine actors giving solid performances--more credit to them for being able to deliver this utter nonsense.",2016
10,"I simply love this series. Attractive actors and actresses specially Yon is acting excellent. His eyes and body acting is perfect. The content of the movie, the location and the beautiful scenes are amazing. The location of the movie is a very nice place in Spain. Although the language of the movie is Spanish but still it is stunning and I can't wait watching all parts without losing any moment. Even when I can't focus on a scene I have to go back and see it again. I like the way that the movie is not predictable. One of the strength points of the series is that all family members can watch it together. I highly recommend it to everyone who like series.",2016
10,"I felt like going back to 1900 while watching the show. One of the best I've ever seen. The acting was flawless. Thanks to Amaia Salamanca and Yon Gonzalez,such a great couple-on-scene. Concha Velasco kills it. If you're looking for something new, out of the routine of cliché love-drama story I think this is one of the best you can get. I like the fact that they didn't play it out around one thing which makes the show interesting, not-boring and addictive. The way they made out the stage is just awesome. All the mystery involved, the love triangle between Diego, Alicia and Julio is too involving. ",2015
5,"The husband is clever, cunning, observant, and devious.. yet during most of this entire series, he does not see the Mrs constantly running around, pretty much in plain sight, meeting up with with the best looking young guy for miles around. We know they're are always contrivances in any production, in any story-line, in support of the plot.. but this production just takes it to such a level of absurdity as to make it farce... Spanish soap-opera style. There are so many additional holes and missteps in this production that make it barely mediocre. Way too many to list in other than a short-story. The work of the cast is for the most part okay, but they all have their very noticeable lapses. And as for the actor they chose to play the role of Javier, what was up with that.. was he the only one they could pick!! It was a VERY looong three season series, and to tell you the truth, the only way many would be sticking with it, was for the likes of Amaia Salamanca. She is without a shade of doubt one of the most strikingly beautiful women on the planet (just search on bing.com ...wow!). She too had her ups and downs dealing with the absurd script, but it would be near impossible for most any man not to forgive her most any wrong. Oh yeah.. and after all's said and done, in the end Mom winds up getting away with murder(s).. how's that for your 'happy ending.'",2016
8,"It is true to say that Smiley is no Bourne nor Bond but Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a beautifully played and observed spy film. Should you expect car chases, spills, thrills, gadgets galore and closely-choreographed fight scenes then you WILL be disappointed. ",2011
9,"Forty-six year old Swedish director Tomas Alfredson came to prominence three years ago when he directed the film adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel 'Let The Right One In'. After the initial success of the vampiric romantic drama, Alfredson became attached to an international adaptation of John le Carre's espionage-novel 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'. Based on aspects of le Carre's (also known as David Cornwell) experiences during his time as a member of the British Intelligence service sectors MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s, Alfredson creates a fine, absorbing picture which engrosses from beginning to end.",2011
9,"I have been eagerly awaiting this production for a long time and have not been disappointed. Never have I seen such a compilation of such fabulous performances together. No way is this another James Bond, it is how the world of espionage was, and is today. No car chases in Aston Martins or gadgets but a world of seedy little offices and the grim reality of this genre. What had the greatest impact on myself was the slow deep menace conveyed by all. Difficult to single out any one performance as all were amazing but I particularly admired Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Tom Hardy for their work. At times this film has some unexpected moments of shocking cruelty. Complex character portrayal is presented in a slow deep style that only inspires you to know more about the person. The story itself is a classic and known by many, yet this production introduces a few changes which work well. One of the most absorbing and classy movies I have seen and has left a lasting impact on me. Please, please, please, make Smiley's People now.",2011
8,"Boldly announcing himself upon the stage of international cinema with 2009's Let the Right One In, the significant critical and commercial acclaim accorded director Thomas Alfredson clearly proved him a filmmaker capable of pulling off high quality adaptations of complex and dark literary sources.",2011
6,"John Le Carre is without doubt one of the literary greats of the late 20th Century . A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema ",2013

3,"I know my limits. I just couldn't follow the plot of this labyrinthine movie adapted from John Le Carre's novel, which had previously been made into an award-winning BBC TV series with Alec Guinness as spy-catcher George Smiley. That itself had been a multi-part production but here the action, or should that be inaction, is condensed into a still lengthy two and a half-hour film.",2014
7,"Though skilfully adapted and made with a pleasing combination of solidity and flair, this film ultimately disappoints. Its tone, grandly, cinematically sombre, strays occasionally into bathos or, at the end, barely suppressed triumphalism. At times you feel that television, an intrinsically more humdrum medium, is better suited to the moral seediness of this genre. And of course it's with its BBC television predecessor that this film invites comparison. Some things come out about even. John Hurt is a charismatic Control, even if the shortened format doesn't allow us to witness the gradual and complete disintegration of the character that Alexander Knox portrays in the BBC series. But Colin Firth brings nothing to the role of Haydon to match Ian Richardson's self-tormenting irony; it would have been interesting to see what Ciarán Hinds, already in the cast but underemployed as Roy Bland, might have done with the role. As the central character, Gary Oldman is an enigma, a man who reveals nothing of himself to others. Alec Guinness gives us something more complex, a character who reveals to others exactly what he wants them to see. In showing the light in his character, he also reveals the shadows. Oldman's Smiley is, by contrast, a hero for our modern age: we don't much care who or what he is as long as he is on our side and we win.",2011
8,"Freezing. John Le Carre's spy story has a new version. Tomas Alfredson the Swedish director of the chillingly great ""Let The Righ On In"" understands the British climate. Impersonal raincoats wore by the very personal Gary Oldman are only part of the story. An undercurrent of passionate wheelings and dealings with poker face players makes for an engrossing tale that allows us some kind of distance. The production design is a masterpiece on its on. Just look at the wallpapers. I'm not going to venture into the actual plot but the performances. Gary Oldman is superb in a slightly younger and more virile version of Alec Guinness who played George Smiley in a celebrated British miniseries in 1979. Colin Firth's bisexual turn brings a dark sort of lightness to the proceedings. Tom Hardy is also superb as are Mark Strong and John Hurt. If you're a Le Carre fan you'll be enthralled, if you're not you may become one.",2011
1,"I really wanted to enjoy this film. I watch the 1979 TV series at least once a year and was looking forward to a new, dark, edgy take on a well-loved story.",2011
3,"The first episode of the BBC series sets the tone perfectly, introducing the key players and telling us what kind of people they are, all by just having them enter a room for a meeting without saying a word. The trouble with the movie version is that we never get the chance to know the characters. They are faceless people with difficult names and we don't care which one of them is the bad guy. I have read the book at least three times, seen the TV series twice and was still totally confused by the movie. Anyone who hasn't read the book, I would suggest, doesn't stand a chance. The grimy landscape around the Hotel Islay was nicely done. But why make every scene grimy? Where was the circus? Where were the lights of Shaftsbury Avenue? Where were the green fields around Jim Prideaux's prep school? The key scene with Connie Sachs is destroyed by a totally out-of-place crudity and the climax, when the mole is revealed, is thrown away with zero drama. What was going on?",2012
9,"Ever since I first heard of this Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, I knew I wanted to see it. Primarily because of the cast, with Gary Oldman and John Hurt two of the best underrated actors today, Colin Firth a vast majority of the time delivering solid to marvellous work, Mark Strong who impresses me more and more every time I see him and Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch two of the most promising young stars working now.",2011
10,"Clearly wasted on the attention-deficit cohort, this slow-burner rewards the effort and concentration you give it tenfold. It is only when you see the characterisation that cinema is capable of, in films like this, that you realise how crudely drawn and unsatisfying most performances are at the moment. Others have commented on the plot, but that is not the most interesting part of Tinker Tailor. It is the pulse that is palpable in the small static moments, where every image and gesture seems to thrum with an expectation of something wrong; a jarring discord that never lets the audience settle. You are brought into the personae of the characters in a way that makes you feel culpable; never letting you off the hook morally. This film is so good - packed with a thousand tiny pleasures - that it is sad that not everyone loves it. I wish it had had the confident US release that it deserved.",2012
4,"The acting was first-rate. The adaptation was horrible. There are so many holes in the plot I felt as though I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie......you know, the part where we're supposed to see the birth of the story line and some character development. Anyone who wasn't already familiar with the book would be completely lost. It's like I was watching part 2 of a two-part miniseries without having seen part 1. It was beyond disjointed. Did Cirian Hinds even have any lines in the movie?? He was in scene after scene but I don't remember him saying anything.",2012

6,"Looking at this film and its concept I was intrigued. With this said the film does fail to live up to the potential of its concept. One of the few major issues i have with this film is the lack of back-story with regards to the implementation of the 'body clock', along with the lack of true quality acting and a well written script. As a result of this what the viewer will get from this film experience are moments (and i mean moments) where you are enjoying the film, but by the end of it all you can reflect on what you have seen and notice that you could have done a lot more with your money if you had not gone to watch In Time.",2011
5,What an intriguing idea. This is the type of SC-FI that I usually tend to like over just another film with space battles. SC-Fi films that make you think and make parallels to real life. Once I saw the previews to this film I thought this film would be something special. Not only did the film have an intriguing idea but only draw from mythic arc types like Robin Hood and numinous of great themes but the film falls short on such a great idea with a failure to really understand what type of scope there really could have been with this story along with a less than stellar cast the film is entertaining but only a footnote of what it could have been.,2012

8,"I think this film's rating is too low. This movie not only presents a plausible nightmarish idea for what life might become in the future, but also provides a thought-provoking critique of the present. We already sell our precious time, of which we have an only limited amount, for money. It is already true that some people's time is worth many times more than the time of others, and that many poor people in America spend their lives working and running around, with almost no time left over for themselves, their family, and what they actually *want* to do in their lives. It is true, also, I think, that people now have much less free time than they did in past centuries - ironically despite all the new technology that was supposed to have given us more free time. It is likely that in the future there will be even less free time left, and that if healthcare continues to be in private hands, it will really be a matter or life or death. I can forgive this film the car chases and the guns (which, I agree, are not needed and boring, and could have been taken out), but I think that the dialogue was interesting, and the characters were not one-dimensional. For all this, I think this film makes a lasting impression and will even give you nightmares.",2013
9,"It's interesting that this film is coming out now, as the ""Occupy"" movement is raging in several cities around the world.

1,I went to the movie with high expectation generated by really good trailers. But the good part ends there. The storyline is too simplistic and out of depth. The protagonist is modern day robin-hood who takes it upon himself to rob time rich people and distribute the excess time to the poor. He robs the bank with such an ease and without any resistance that I wonder why anybody before him didn't try that! ,2011
1,"OK, so I had high hopes for this movie. I saw the trailer and as a closet socialist loved the clear underlying theme of the rich having to keep many people down in order to maintain their power.

6,"It's time to review this dystopian sci-fi thriller film. Written & directed by Andrew Niccol, the movie open up in 2169, where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation, when people turn 25 years old, they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year; when it reaches zero that person ""times out"" and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into ""time zones"" based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) live day-to-day and New Greenwich, the wealthiest time zone, where Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfield) can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). For this favor, Henry gives his time to Will, so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother (Olivia Wilde). Now with plenty of time, he plans to give the people, the freedom of their lives, by making the upper class pay. Too bad, Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this, so that he can spent time, buying nice cars, eating at fancy restaurants, trying to hook up with Sylvia, attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker. It takes forever to get to the 'Robin Hood' plot that the movie trailer promise us. Lots of filling scenes that slow down the pace to a crawl. The movie plot is a thinly-veiled allegory for the Occupy Wall Street movement against the 1%. It's supposed to be social commentary about the growing global divide between the haves and have-nots. It's an intriguing premise, but unfortunately, the movie follows a really predictable formulaic plot, ending with lousy satisfying conclusion. Robbing banks will solve the economy?!? What? This is a good example of Hollywood not understanding economics. Do they think, robbing banks would solve the economy? It would make it worst. ""Is it stealing if it's already stolen?"" quotes the movie. Yes, it is. This movie is just a mess; trying to add a Bonnie and Clyde type heist story with political overtones doesn't work. There was no depth to the movie's resolution other than everyone deserves equality. The movie lacks good exposition. It's too heavy-handed, explaining a lot of things that didn't need to. The movie takes a lot of Artistic License in science and economic causing a lot of things to make no sense. Obviously made for a teen demographic, everybody in the film cast is beautiful as hell. It's implied, they are genetically engineered, but still, I didn't know, the really poor, can still look amazing gorgeous, despite only have hours or minutes to live. It's really jarring. I do hope that the film makers know that aging isn't a gene. Even if the rich can live forever, the skin will still be thinner and wrinkled by time manly due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Aging can't be stop. Only postponed. Also, why 25 year old is the cut-off date? Isn't that the age frame where most people do the most work? Why not, use the ones that you selection to be born, longer like until 50 or 60 year old until terminating them? They isn't no point to eliminate them in the first place. You kill a lot of young people, who does the majority of the work? There is no reason why children should even being born, if they're genetically engineered and nobody dies from old age. Another thing, why waste resources waiting for the children to reach 25 in the first place? Just create a fully grown male and female. It doesn't make sense why people still need to eat and drink, when they don't feed on energy. How can you get alcohol poisoning if disease are eradicate in this world? There are so many loose-ends that I can go on, about like what happen to the time, when people die due to mauling to their bodies. If they are genetically engineered, couldn't they just get fix up? The movie even forget sub-plot like what happen to Will's late father. The movie is also very insulting. A lot of over the top rich people have Jewish last names pushing the Greedy Jew stereotypes. The acting is mediocre. Justin Timberlake is pretty lackluster. The best actor in the film, had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfield is just there to be the love-interest, despite Will kidnapping her at gunpoint and almost killing her in a car accident. How romantic, Stockholm Syndrome, Patty Hearst right there. How stupid! The good things about the film is the score, the action, and the set design. It really does look futuristic. I love the time fighting race against the clock tense moments. Still, there were a lot of stupid suicidal disregard of time allowance by characters that makes you wonder. Are these people, stupid? Will himself keeps coming into large quantities of time, then giving it away and leaving himself only a few hours or even minutes instead of a few years. There is a strongly reminiscent of this film to other media works. Due to that reason, the film got often dealt with copyright lawsuits. One is Harlan Ellison whom believe that the film's plot was based on his 1965 short story 'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman"". Another is Lee Falk who believe it was taken from ""Mandrake and the Goldman: Time is Money"", a comic issue. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film 'The Price of Life' & the Hannu Rajaniemi's novel 'The Quantum Thief' as well. Overall: There isn't enough time in the world, to get me to re watch this bad movie. You're probably better off just watching 1997 Gattaca than wasting time and money on this movie.",2014
7,"Its the year 2161 and genetic alteration has allowed humans to stop aging after their 25th birthday thereby making it possible for them to live forever. But due to concerns of overpopulation, the system is tweaked so that money is replaced by 'living time' as the standard currency and people must acquire more time through labor and commercial means after turning 25 years of age, or die within a year. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old man who lives with his 50-year old mother, Rachel (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and works in the factory. He encounters a 105-year-old Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), who has more than a century on his clock and is attacked by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), the 75-year old mobster boss of a gang called the 'Minutemen', who are infamous for stealing other people's time by force. Will helps Hamilton escape the confrontation. Hamilton tells Will that there's enough time for everyone, but it is being stockpiled for the rich to use in becoming immortal. An upset Henry describes how he is tired of being alive. He commits suicide, but not before transferring all his time to Will. Raylond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his Timekeepers investigate the death and believe Will killed Henry for his time. So now Will is on the run from the law. After the tragic and unjust death of his mother later that night, Will promises to bring down the system and exact revenge. He forages into the upper class New Greenwich and along his travails, he meets the beautiful 27-year-old Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) who is the daughter of the 90-year old millionaire, time-loaning businessman Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser).

It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.",2011

We know by now that the plight of the ""colored"" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild margins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget documentaries of the period or ""The Long Walk Home"" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in ""The Help"" too and she's very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.",2011
7,So....,2011
10,I saw a preview of this film a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. I am huge fan of the book and could not wait to see the movie. I was not disappointed. I LOVED this movie. I have not seen anything more moving or more real in such a long time.,2011
2,"This movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it every character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference.",2011
1,"This film uses every cliché in the book starting with the liberal minded white person who is the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people.This film is emotionally manipulative and panders to a sentimental reduction of complex history. Its moves were predictable and uses every trick in the book, even the scene in the church is cliché. Both the white and the black characters are mostly reductive caricatures out of some story book world which doesn't do justice to the historical complexity of such situations. Why would you want to make a saccharine comic book out of profound historical situations-- other than to pander to audiences longing for a feel good experience for the sake of box office. I actually don't mean to disrespect to people who like it, and I don't want to attack the actors. They didn't write the film, but at the same time, I can't believe that so many people fell for this bag of tricks. Still, a bigger problem and disservice a movie like this does to our culture is that such bad history and simplistic human portrayals turns race dynamics into good guy bad guy stories which we can watch with a complacent feeling of how much better we are than those bad old days. Such complacency leads to a historical ignorance that retards honest critique and real progress. This movie would be better if it just didn't pretend to be about something. Let it be some sappy comic book. That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. At least it would be more honest.",2012

We loved our black maid Veronica (first black person I'd ever seen and I thought she was made of my favorite stuff -- chocolate), and our family corresponded with her (and sent her money) for years after we moved. Other families had black maids and no one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever talked about them or treated them the way they are in this film (haven't read the book) but instead with value and respect, though within the confines of the segregationist times.

It's the most powerful scene I saw in a film in 2011 and my heart just sunk as I watched it. ,2014

This reminds me of one of those old blaxploitation films gone ""chick"" flick, or maybe a second rate version of ""Steel Magnolias"" with a Jim Crow law plot thrown in.

1,"This is like one of those afternoon made for TV ""life affirming"" dramas. Full of sugar, whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in truth and bite. Ugh! The performances are almost uniformly two dimensional - even Allison Janney opted for cartoon like characterisation. The period detail is sometimes accurate but occasionally glaringly inaccurate. For example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic style. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend of Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen? But there again I haven't read the novel. Could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy?",2012

I'm just tired of it.",2011

10,"After reading the book, I was anxious to see how well the actresses matched the characters. I absolutely LOVED Emma and Viola. They made the movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly. I don't think many actresses could have pulled it off. Also, it was a relief to see that Hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than in the book. What I like most about The Help is that it wouldn't be a huge deal to not have read the book; the movie would suffice (creating the same emotions in both film and book). Two side notes: (1) even after seeing the movie, read the end of the book regarding the author. (2) Emma is awesome--would love to work with her!",2011

After seeing the trailer, this looked like a fun movie so I gave it a shot and was not disappointed. It was pretty much like I thought it was going to be. Sure the whole alien invaders thing has been done a lot, and this sticks to the formula to a certain extent (minus the annoying deus ex machina plot device), but it was original enough to set it apart.",2012

It is nice to finally see something that hasn't been recycled from another movie, game, book, etc. That being said the main problems in the movie come from a rather dull open story. It leaves you with many unanswered questions. There are also many flaws in different aspects of the movie. Being an avid movie goer I give this a 6 out of 10 because of the original idea. But it could have been way better had they developed script better. The other flaw was the lack of graphics. They clearly spent very little on special effects. I feel that this should have been a TV movie. Not something to go see in the theater.",2012

I confess, I hadn't wanted to go at all but my friend insisted and so to keep the peace I went. Granted, the beginning is a uneven and it was unclear where the story was going but once it clicks in the thing moves right along. You are never sure who is going to die next and that helps keep the suspense level high. The acting is serviceable and the location is a refreshing change from the usual New York/Chicago skylines. It's frankly more interesting to watch the tale unfold against the dinginess of contemporary Moscow, and with Russian soldiers instead of Americans. Moreover, the special effects are simple, but effective.",2011

Hasn't been a box office hit or getting much in the way of good reviews, but if basic alien invasion is your cup of tea, you will probably enjoy it too. I liked the aliens, not your usual lot, and the Moscow sets. The cast gave decent performances as well. I would have liked to see more of the invaders and would have liked a few more battle scenes, and could have enjoyed it just as well without the 3D effects. All things considered, I will add it to my collection when it's available on disc. Catch this during a matinée if you must, but you'll probably like it a whole lot more on a theater's big screen than waiting for HBO.",2012

It's just plain bad. If it were a made-for-TV movie, it would still be one of the worst I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say about the film is it has an interesting premise. The actual end product, however, is sickeningly dull. We had two children with us and they were bored out of their minds.",2011

You would think they learned a thing or two about pesky humans after all their attempts at conquest, but no, they are none better than Hollywood. They just never learn. All they do is provide us with some eye candy and then get beat by some smoking hippies. Damn if they didn't have the technology to exterminate a bunch of wussies couldn't they borrow some of our own radar and homing missiles, seems to do the job here on earth. This is what happens when you hire someone from Hollywood to do the job for you. The next time, I'd suggest them to wipe out Hollywood first, then maybe they'll have a chance.

Then these orbs begin to become invisible and start disintegrating people by the masses. So now that we have that deep, deep plot out of the way, lets begin. How did this movie get made? Apparently around 30 Million dollars worth of special effects was spent on what exactly? Invisible aliens? The special effects were of the Sci Fi Channel variety. The large scoped landscape shots of Russia in the aftermath of destruction were obvious CGI. I can't fill you in on how the acting was because the script was so laughable it would have made Marlon Brando look like Hannah Montana. That being said, the acting was terrible. Emile Hirsch gave his all but the rest of the cast gave up half way through. I got the sense that the unknown actresses gave up, laughing at the script between takes. Solutions just magically pop out of thin air time and time again with no explanation. It's as if light bulbs literally pop on above our hero's heads and suddenly they have years of Scientific knowledge and are experts in electromagnetism. The explanation? ""I watched shark week."" That's not a joke guys, that was the explanation. So bottom line? It's a B movie void of the humor or charm that makes B movies lovable. The worst part? They weren't trying to make a B movie, they were trying to make a blockbuster. One of the worst movies I have ever sat through.",2012

The special effects were on the level of a made-for-TV-movie on the sci-fi channel. The 3D was needless because there was nothing enhanced since the special effects and the aliens were practically non-existent. I would advise to save your money and time and stay home and watch a good sci-fi DVD. This movie would have appealed to children from 10-15 years old, with absolutely no knowledge of what constituents a good movie experience, plot or special effects.

I've seen B-sci-fi films that are better than this. What an  excruciating way to spend the holidays, in a theater watching a  time-waster like THE DARKEST HOUR. It's a collection of dreadful  dialogue and talents like Joel Kinnaman who can be of more use  elsewhere, in other gigs. I admit the concept is interesting, like what  those alien sparks are actually made up of and how those floating  sparks of energy decimate its victims, there also are scenes worth  noting because they intend on making the characters selfless and heroic  but you don't really feel that emotionally because the script is far  from good enough to even think about reaching that emotional believable  strength, the speeches are unbearable, the 3D is pointless. The thrills  or the sequences that are meant to be suspenseful are neither new nor  creative. And I can't help but feel that the entire film is nothing but  a weak attempt to promote tourism for Moscow. The young key actors:  Emile Hirsch, Max Minghella, Olivia Thirlby, have a few critically  acclaimed films on their resumes, like Into The Wild, The Social  Network, and Juno respectively, and so seeing them in this poor excuse  for a sci-fi action/thriller is just painful to watch.",2011
3,"Well what can I say, a good storyline ruined by budgetary constraints. It seems these days that the latest way of reducing the post-production expense is to shoot an invisible alien at night. The acting was just above amateur, in fact I have seen many amateur performances that would make this production look like a school project. The ending was such that it was either left open to pave the way for a sequel or because they totally ran out of money at one hour and twenty-five minutes. The film ends where the story really begins, such a same not to have realised the true potential of the screenplay. The concept of the aliens was unusual and I must say fairly original, however one has to suspend any knowledge of physics in order to make them believable. Aliens that seem to be of pure electrical energy explode with a shower of solid matter when killed, which makes no sense whatsoever. Please, someone with a real skill for production and direction do a remake, Stephen Spielberg are you listening?",2011
1,"I like alien invasion films, so I couldn't miss the chance to see this instalment in the sub-genre. Even though the trailer didn't make it look like this film would be anything extraordinary or ground-breaking, I was curious to see it. What a disappointment it turned out to be.",2012
1,"I should have listened to my inner voice that told me this director's previous film 'Right At Your Door' was awful and this would be too...and it was. Dreadful. Pointless vapid characters one feels not empathy with, poor CGI extra-terrestrials, stilted clunky clichéd dialog that could have been written by a 7th-grader, utterly aimless storyline with gaping plot-holes and (a)pathetic ending that showed less imagination than my 3 year-old son. I would recommend staying well away from this utterly atrocious rubbish. If you thought 'Skyline' was a poor alien invasion film, this one has actually gone one better. Or is it worse? I don't care, I was just happy to see the credits roll. I do not know how this got made. Avoid at all costs, this has no value at all.",2012
1,"We went to see this Christmas night. The entire family thought this was horrible. We were ready to leave 20 minutes into it. We (I) was hoping for it to get good and was sorely disappointed: it only got worse. The dialog was below amateurish, the acting was poor, the story/plot ridiculous. Don't Waste Your Money! Wait for Netflix or Cable TV. Not worth paying for. The only redeeming thing about this movie was some of the special effects. Most were done fairly well, but the aliens themselves, once their invisible shields were disrupted, were nothing more than scary looking Pokemon type creatures. It was a big letdown. This whole movie was a big letdown.",2011
3,"2 software geeks arrive to Moscow to sell their idea to some big shots so that they can earn millions of dollars. The film, of course, is up- to-date in terms of referring to GPS and social networking and touchscreen etc. when this brand new idea is being discussed by the characters. The boys are about to join a meeting when it turns out one of their competitors stole their idea and he is about to cash-in on it.",2011

8,"When I decided that i wanted to see this movie, I wasn't expecting a lot. The acting and plot weren't very impressive but you just need to ignore that a little. The concept to me was very refreshing! It was cool to let the typical 'aliens destroy humanity story' play in another city instead of good old new york or LA. At some moments I was honestly very excited and thrilled by the rush of the movie. Although mostly you can predict who's going to die next. But there are still some scenes that really surprised me. At some point the group joined up what some Russian survivors. After that the plot of the film goes a little downhill but is still fun to watch. If you like sci-fi movies and are also interested in a new scene ( moscow) then i would really recommended this movie! Don't take it too seriously just enjoy and imagine what you would do!",2012
5,"Season One was great to start with: We had Emily VanCamp tackle a villain-type role as the main character, which for me, added originality in comparison to other lead roles we have seen. Having said that, the character lost it's touch when the first season ended, Emily's character became dull and soft-hearted, and the show in general just lost it's touch. ",2013
2,"I thought the first series was really good. The way the series began with what turned out to be more or less the finish and the well developed plot lines, with great twists that showed us how we got there. There was a clue where the show was headed when the second last show in season 1 basically filled 40 odd minutes to cover the contract obligations, IE it showed us NOTHING. Season 2 is a joke, the initiative this and that, random characters pitching up here and there (the foster brother, the girlfriend of the previously gay guy, the previously gay guy's previous boyfriend blah blah). The writers don't know where to take the show so are applying the classic soap tactic of 'throw enough characters at it and some will be interesting'. Not working so far and I can't see this show being far off cancellation. Season one would have got 8/9. Now I give it 2.",2013
2,"I remember the press special they did after the first season, where they admitted that when they started, they didn't know the show would be what it was, so the had been writing on an as-you- go basis. The show has become a soap opera with gaping plot holes, because the story was designed to be a one season story. Good job stretching for season 2, but by the time the Faux- manda showed up, everyone should've known what this was. And now that they've killed Daniel I really just can't even pretend to do it anymore. You guys do NOT know where you're going, which is fine for daytime soaps, but this is prime time! I think they should have ended the show when Emily got her revenge. The writers seem to have run out of ideas and whats going on is totally unbelievable. Ridiculous. I think I am done.",2015
5,"At first, I was THE biggest fan and would have rated that show almost 100 out of ten. So, I was totally into that series... Since Season two has begun it's gradually getting worse... If I had known that in before, I would have stopped watching it after season 1 and thought of an end on my own. The whole story is so artificially constructed that's almost an ordeal to watch it (referring to THE INITIATIVE)... The Initiative did that, the Initiative is scary, the Initiative will kill you... For my ears it's like a writer's block and the staff didn't know what to construct next. BTW: will there be aliens soon? I am so disappointed and still hope that Revenge gets it together and make a sharp turn into ""WOW, EXCITING!!!"" (like Season 1)",2013
10,"I am hooked on this show! my daughter (22) and I agree this is our favorite show on TV currently. Every week I look forward to seeing how the characters develop and who she chooses for revenge. Not at all what I expected in a pleasant way. The only thing I am not sure of is how long this show can go, does it have a set end date because a show like this reminds me of an extended mini series since it will have to finish at some point. I hope the writers have taken that into account as this show needs a conclusion to make it a perfect show. Hopefully others agree about this show so that its not cancelled before its time. I recommend everyone try to see this (and to watch the first episodes for the background)",2011
9,"This show was the one that made me want to sign up on IMDb to rave about. I had some preconceived notions of what this show would be like and which demographic it would appeal to (not mine) and was not expecting to like it at all. Was I pleasantly surprised! I like the way the story is unfolding. I like that the characters are believable, aside from the fact that they are all incredibly attractive. ",2011
9,"Truly great show! There is mystery, love story, money, angry evil lady, and a lot of good looking people. You can not help but think, what happened, what is the big secret all those people are carrying. There are so many things going on but at the same time it is easy to follow along. You will love it. I can not see them doing more than one season, but hey you never know. This show is a mix between desperate housewives, OC, Tween Peaks, Dexter, and Harper's Island. Can not wait to see more. It has this dark feel about it but at the same time it is warm and makes you laugh at times. Also I think that the casting is excellent: Emily VanCamp - diverse; Madeleine Stowe - chillingly evil, yet you can not help to admire and respect her, Connor Paolo - funny and is going to be one of my favorite. Anyhow i hope this show does well. Watch it!",2011
5,"Season 1 One of the best paced and rewarding shows on TV, a true guilty pleasure.",2013
2,"What is it with Hollywood drama series that don't know where they're going? This series started out great, it had a good premise and an interesting set of characters. Think of it as a modern day Dynasty.",2013
10,"When I watched the pilot episode, I found the series promising and I really loved it. Then, after continuing the following episodes, it took my interest. The show is dark, smart, filled with subtle humor and wise quotes. The plot is twisted, dark and tense. Each character has an interesting story, presented in a really good way. The acting is perfect and the writing is complete. Emily Van Camp who plays the main role as Emily Thorne is just amazing! I really recommend this show to anybody. It's always interesting, sometimes funny, dark, and mysterious. ABC has another thing to embark, after finishing ""Desperate Housewives"".",2012
10,I was extremely impressed watching the pilot online. 'Revenge' has huge potential. It is based on 'The Count of Monte Cristo' by Alexandre Dumas. It usually takes me more than an episode or two to like a show but I can assure you this one will get you hooked right away. I can't wait to see how Emily/Amanda gets her revenge on each and every one of the people who destroyed her and her father's lives. How far will she go to satisfy her vengeance? Who will her next target be? Will people find out about her real intentions? These are just a few of many questions to be answered. Tune in! You do not want to miss Emily's 'Revenge'!,2011
10,We all know Emily VanCamp for her girl next door roles but Revenge puts a whole new spin on her girl next door role with her devious behavior. There are so many characters with connections to her I don't know which guy(all of who are handsome) to root for because of the plan which the audience is led to believe is hers I don't know if I want it to be completed. There are so many possibilities the show could go anyway and continue to go anyway it chooses. This show is a refreshing change of pace from the average TV drama and is completely addictive. Each episode leaves you itching for the next. 2011 is the year of new TV series and many have already been cancelled and lots of the new shows are left struggling yet I have a strong feeling this series is here to stay.,2011
6,"REVENGE is a guilty pleasure. Just finished season one. If one can suspend disbelief, great. If one is looking for reality, check that one at the door. Even with todays technology, what the characters do with all the technical mechanisms, no way could all this happen. Twenty years ago or less this series could not have possibly been produced. There are more loopholes than meets the eye. And just about all occurrences are improbable. Just one instance SPOILER ALERT. Lydia lives in a high class well secured apartment building. Yet, two, not one, but two men get in her apartment without any difficulty at all!!! Emily's disguises are almost nil. Strange people just a few years later didn't recognize her. And how did she get to be one of the hired help at the big NY Eve party at the Graysons. No credentials, no background, no references. How was she paid? Convenience for the viewer but so phony otherwise. And how can Emily and or her 'partner in crime' possibly do what they do without ever being seen or noticed? Just a few of dozens of examples that are unexplainable. Again, if you just want to be entertained as a thrill ride, then by all means, enjoy the ride. REVENGE could have just ended after the first season. Just started season 2 for fun..ANOTHER ALERT: How in the hell did Victoria escape from the plane that was blown up????? Unless this was all a dream, this is the stupidest, craziest example of writing EVER. Will I continue to watch season two? Now THAT'S a cliffhanger!! Well after watching the two remaining seasons....Big mistake. Characters make no sense, everything felt padded to fill time and the actors, got bless them, tried hard to keep a straight face while reciting terrible lines they were given. Why oh why do they always have someone listening in to conversations? So many plot holes it's hard to recall...Except for one Glaring hole. In the last season Mason confronts Amanda at the airport when she tries to get to Jack. How in the hell did he know she'd be there WHEN SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE'D BE THERE UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!! It's things like that that are very irritating. And why kill off so many characters?? Unbelievable. Season four was a MAJOR disappointment. Just so many loopholes and inconsistencies. SKIP THIS TRASH. The less said about Marguex character the better. Why did they make her turn so evil???? While I'm at it why didn't Amanda confront Victoria about the reason her son died was because of HER hiring that hit lady to get Amanda. It backfired and got her son instead. Sloppy writing on this one.",2013

I try to imagine, but I could never come up with the ideas that this show has. My only problem now is that the Revenge series are mostly re-runs and that can get ""old and boring"" very quickly. I wished they would make sure we have a new show each week because it's really fun to talk over with friends to try and see who comes closest to what's going to happen on the next show. My friends and I have fast become ""family"" because we're all so involved with Revenge.",2012
4,"I liked this series until lately. It had it's ups and downs but, held my interest. Without spoilers, the last few episodes made it clear this will never become more than a daytime soap opera. At first, the story had plot completions and small goals that were met or, at least resolved, for better or worse. That no longer happens. As I can see no possible way for the show to rekindle my interest, I am quitting now. If you enjoy flat out soap operas, and I am not criticizing you if you do, than this might be the show for you. If you want plot advancement and forward movement, than don't waste your time.",2013
1,"I found this show no different than any other night time soap opera. Very ""run of the mill"" and formulaic. From the first episode I felt I was just watching a ""Dynasty"" remake. To make matters worse the writer of this pathetic tripe is so heavy handed with the flash backs we start the season off with who shot J.R. Ewing and flashback 5 months. Now watching a flashback we flashback through Amanda's troubled and misspent youth. If the writers expected to hold my attention to watch more than just the pilot, they should have avoided the conflicted scenes with Gabriel Mann. Otherwise the character Amanda should have killed him in the very first encounter, leading the viewer to wonder if she shot the man on the beach or had him shot. Obviously the girl not capable of murder is not capable of revenge either. The story is a wash from the very beginning. If you think I am spoiling? No, you are told in the pilot episode in the first 15 minutes who lives and dies the first season.",2013

9,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a rather large fan following and for good reason. The 2009 Swedish film is incredibly solid and well-acted with just the right amount of wrong. The two sequels that followed had their own uphill battles (switching directors, lower budget, etc) and weren't necessarily bad, but just failed to capture that raw emotional tenacity the original film offered. When news of a remake began making the usual rounds, there was a fairly large uproar amongst the internet community (isn't there always?), especially when it was announced Noomi Rapace wouldn't be returning as Lisbeth Salander. Most American remakes aren't directed by David Fincher though and while it isn't vastly different in comparison to its Swedish counterpart, Fincher has at least improved upon what was already a fantastic piece of cinema.",2011
8,"After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. ",2011
5,"I cannot see how all the Hollywood money was used? I must have been the most expensive removal of subtitles in the history. Camera and light felt a bit better than the Swedish original version, but the end result felt too similar to the previous one. I also questioning reviews' sanity when they claim 'Rooney for Oscar' - she did nothing out of expected performance - in my opinion. Still the movie is better than general Hollywood movies, where 'actors' only scream f**k to each other.",2011
5,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo just adds to the list of crummy American remakes. First of all, what is with the opening credits? Are we watching a James Bond movie? Just because Daniel Craig is in it? The opening credits are completely disconnected from the rest of the film.",2012
5,"Watching the original Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo,"" I was actively engaged with its dual story lines, but I also  found myself pondering which of the two was the more important. Now  that David Fincher has made an English-language remake, I find myself  pondering what went wrong. Here is a mystery thriller so cold, so  distant, and so lacking in energy that it feels neither mysterious nor  thrilling. It follows the plot of the original film fairly closely, and  yet it makes a number of small changes that drastically affect its  credibility. I'm also stumped by the curious decision to retain the  Swedish setting. If you have gone to the trouble of casting  English-speaking actors, it seems only fitting that you should change  the story's location to somewhere more appropriate, say America or  Britain.  Adapted from the novel by Stieg Larsson, the title is a description of  goth chick Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an emotionally walled-off  computer hacker who works for a security company. In the original film,  we got only scraps of her back story, and yet just enough was given to  pique our interest. We were challenged to read her. Who was she? What  had she gone through? What led up to a disturbing watershed moment seen  only in flashback? In this remake, her back story doesn't even amount  to crumbs. That watershed moment is altogether removed, as is a  significant chunk of her family history. Because of this, we're no  longer compelled to probe her mind, to try and understand why she is  the way she is. All we see is a girl in her early twenties in serious  need of an attitude adjustment.  She was hired to investigate a former reporter turned magazine  publisher named Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who lost a libel case  against a powerful billionaire. Although he must pay a serious amount  in damages, he insists that he was set up. Lisbeth is inclined to  agree; her investigative work turned up nothing incriminating. Not long  after the trial, Mikael is hired by a man named Dirch Frode (Steven  Berkoff) on behalf of his employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher  Plummer), the former CEO of a family industry. Now retired on a  family-owned island off the mainland, he asks two things of Mikael: To  write a memoir about the Vanger clan and to investigate the case of his  great-niece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 when she was only a  teenager. Henrik is convinced she was murdered, and that her killer is  a member of his family, with whom he does not get along.  Needing an assistant, Mikael is directed towards Lisbeth, who has just  worked her way of a particularly nasty situation with her new guardian,  a sadistic sexual pervert (Yorick van Wageningen) who kept strict  control of her finances. As she and Mikael dig deeper into the mystery,  they must make sense of a series of numbers Harriet wrote in a  notebook, all of which are paired with initials. What do they mean? How  do they connect to a series of murders spread across time and distance,  all involving young women? And in what way does Henrik's family factor  in? Watching the original film, I anxiously awaited the moment the  mystery would be solved. That's because, as contrived as it was, there  was at least the sense that the filmmakers were interested in their own  material. The same cannot be said about this new film. There's no  urgency about it.  I think much of the blame rests on the updated screenplay by Steven  Zaillian, which awkwardly intertwines dark and twisted scenarios with  an undercurrent of dry wit. When Henrik first meets Mikael, for  example, we find that the former is almost jovial  not at all  appropriate given his sad situation. Certain scenes from the original  film were intense, and yet they always felt as if they were character  driven. That's not the case here; most of the intense scenes, including  when Lisbeth spontaneously decides to have sex with Mikael, are  overproduced, as if the intention was to be sensational. The most  glaring misfire is the inclusion of a stray cat. I don't need to spell  out what happens to it. I will say, however, that this plot device is  so overused that it has long since ceased to be symbolic. Now it's just  cruel and disgusting.  Little touches, such as Mikael's affair with his magazine coworker  (Robin Wright) and his relationship with his religious teenage daughter  (Josefin Asplund), contribute absolutely nothing to the story apart  from a surplus of characters. And then there's the ending, which is  really more of an epilogue as it involves events unrelated to the case  of Harriet Vanger. In the original film, it was a brief couple of  scenes that tied up a few loose ends. Here, it goes on much longer than  it should. I'm usually the first to give remakes the benefit of the  doubt. It's certainly not my style to make endless comparisons between  old and new versions of the same story. But in the case of ""The Girl  with the Dragon Tattoo,"" I just can't help myself. I'll make this easy  on you: See the original instead of the remake. Quite simply, the  original is better.  -- Chris Pandolfi",2011

That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara.

And, frankly I can't understand the glowing reviews from critics and praise for Rooney Mara's performance. Did they read the book, or see the Swedish version? First the good. I did like the ending better than the Swedish version. It was closer to the book, and necessary to set up Lisbeth's antagonism toward Bloomkvist in the second book.

Why oh why does this happen to all great books? Why do they have to dumb it down? Of course, they will make another and another. How will they screw with the next two? One can only imagine. I do however recommend you see it. Make sure you wear a sweater, it is cold throughout most of the movie and it is winter you know.",2011
8,I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(Män som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.,2011
1,"David Fincher's adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel is an embarrassment. Fincher manages to reveal all the wrong details at all the wrong moments, effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to the story of the missing girl. Which, despite being the center of the book, is merely glossed over and instead we get unnecessarily graphic rape/sex scenes and a jumbled storyline. Nearly the entire cast give sub-par performances, particularly the main character. Mara Rooney couldn't be less believable as Salander. It was garbage. I can't believe this unoriginal piece of trash managed to get nominated for multiple Oscars. What a shame.",2012
8,"I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels, so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she's also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it's a defining role for Mara, she's made it her own. She's  fierce, highly driven, but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you'll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.",2011
6,"For starters, why did they have remake this one? I would have loved to see the reactions to a remake of ""Casablanca"" in 1945, or what about ""Gone With The Wind"" with another beautiful actress who lacked the fire Leigh brought to the role. Could I even picture ""Titanic"" with another Kate? There was something iconic about the way Rapace's performance in the original ""Dragon"". She raised the bar to the point she might never be able to match the complexity of that performance, an organic, complete, involving role that consumed her and hypnotized the audience. The new film tries very hard to recreate the experience, and it does a decent job in some aspects, but the first film was more than just a performance. It emanated from troubled relationships, from flawed nature, from the way expectations were toppled one after another. In the recent film, changing the ending doesn't quite work; in fact, it hurts the film quite a bit. ",2011
9,"I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade, having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film, but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher, who directed films such as Fight Club, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, and most recently The Social Network (my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech), has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies, save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York, add actors like Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and so many others, a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who also scored The Social Network), and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson (that's right, this isn't a remake but rather a re-adaptation), it all equals out to, in my opinion, the best film of the year by far.",2011
3,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty popular at our house. The trilogy has been read and all the three Scandinavian film versions have been watched. So it was with both anticipation and dread we watched the Hollywood version at the local cineplex yesterday. We walked away feeling puzzled as to why $100 million had been spent to make a movie that had already been brilliantly made only two years earlier. So tonight, we watched the Swedish version again for comparison which only re-enforced our opinions.",2011
1,"The main story of the movie, at least based on screen-time and storyline, is discovering the killer in a supposed murder committed 40 years ago, however there's a lot of time dedicated to Lizabeth's life that leads to nothing, especially the ugly rape scenes, that after seeing the ending of the movie, I found completely irrelevant to the story, if the idea was to show her past and all the mess that was her life, a couple of minutes of a review of her files would have been enough.",2012
3,"Because I consider the Swedish version of Girl...to be a classic on the level of The Maltese Falcon, I avoided the English language version when it was in the theaters. (In reality, the original version may be a better adaptation. John Huston had a Dashiel Hammet book to work from. Steig Larsson's work is transcendentally awful, on a level not even the purple pronouncements of The Bridges of Madison County descended to.) However, late one empty night, the American version showed up on cable and I decided to watch it. It's not bad, only slack and uninspired. The screenwriter and director hewed somewhat closer to the book but to no obvious purpose. And there are at least 4 narrative choices (spoiler alerts won't cover them, I'm afraid. You'll have to trust me--they didn't work.) that damaged the momentum of the film and the chemistry of the two main actors. And finally, David Fincher wasn't able to find an actress to match the ferocity, killer grace and awkward beauty of Noomi Rapace. Rooney Mara is a fine actress (catch her in Soderbergh's Side Effects.). But she's simply too faceless for as vivid a presence as Lisabeth Salander. She's like the 3rd Goth girl at the table, pale and unremarkable. Daniel Craig does a fine job as her partner. But the other actor choices are uninspired if professionally handled. It would have been better if Fincher and co. had done a wholly revised version, set in the US or England with different villains (imagine an African American Salander and the KKK, for example) rather than this dull work.",2013
2,Had I not read the 3 books and seen the Swedish releases I would not have understood the plot. Much of the audio was inaudible mumbling. Important plot elements were changed and/or omitted: jail time; first contact between the principals Mikael and Lisbeth; the coterie of fellow hackers; finding Wennerstrom and giving his location to his criminal associates; putting the missing woman in London -- where it is implausible that she would have escaped discovery -- instead of Australia. ,2012
5,I have watched all the Swedish parts of the movies. Haven't read the books though. So I am not going to compare books with movies.,2013
9,Its detractors mostly fault it for what it's not- it's not your typical doctor-drama and it's not trying to portray a real-life surgeon. ,2012
8,I did not have any expectations or hopes for the show and to my surprise I was entertained and actually found the show charming. Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. ,2012
8,"Let's get this out of the way: it's not a heavy drama, it's not realistic, it's a bit clichéd. But as a weekly viewing experience: it's lighthearted, fun, charming, entertaining and it works without having to try so hard.",2011
10,"I have to say, I watched the pilot episode for the first time last night and I LOVED IT!!!!!! I thought is was an awesome show and I think that it has set up so many avenues for varying parts of the show. I can't wait to see more and I really hope there are more series of this, I am already addicted to it! I don't understand how someone could not enjoy this show personally. I think that Zoe has been set up for some great learning experiences. I can understand that there are some clichés within the show, but come on! which show doesn't have clichés in it these days? It is a television show and people who want to take it too seriously should go watch a documentary instead. I think that the clichés add to the show myself. I cannot wait to watch the next episode and hope that it comes out on DVD so I can buy it as well.",2012
10,"I love this show! All the characters are trying to find their way in life and often make mistakes due to their insecurities or conceptions of what they are supposed to be (Lemon tries to be the perfect southern belle, Zoe tries to live up to what she thinks her parents want her to be ). I love seeing the variety of ages going through life issues such as seeing Zoe finally realizes that her mom really did try to do what she thought was best for her but has errors in judgment. The scenes between Zoe and her father Ethan hart show his concern for her and insecurities about his place as her father . I love how Wade is always concerned about Zoe but is totally immature and can't admit he loves her. He works to keep up his front that he doesn't care because he is insecure about how people see him as second rate. It is fun and charming. Rachel Bilson is a great Zoe! She is funny and sensitive and a good person..and has her flaws it is ..refreshing. The heat wave episode was hilarious. The dynamic between wade and Zoe makes the show. I am tired of everyone blaming Zoe for ruining this and that..that is getting old. I hope the new shows in 2013 continue to evolve the richness of the characters along with the the humor and southern charm! I'd love to see more of AnnaBeth and see Wade realize his potential.",2012
9,"What do I expect from this kind of series? - That I come home after a long day and be able to relax, enjoy sometimes maybe a bit cliché story and laugh at the occasional jokes. Do I need a unique story that has never been told before and a superb acting from the protagonists? No. With that being said, Hart of Dixie is THE series for a rainy day. While for someone mediocre, it is better than the majority of soap operas currently on air. I enjoy the distinctive town of Bluebell very much, reminds me so much of Gilmore Girls' Starshollow! The setting has a rather specific atmosphere, feels like living in the 1950s sometimes. Plus, I have always been a fan of underdogs like Wade. Definitely worth giving a try.",2012
8,It's nice to have a pleasant hour long comedy with light romance on TV where no one is really evil. There are too many crime shows. Josh Schwarz delivers tongue in cheek humor and a good likable cast. It's a Dr Quinn meets Sweet Home Alabama story and it's quite charming. Zoe moves from NYC to Bluebell Alabama to practice medicine. The culture differences do provide enough laughs.,2012
8,"I started this series mostly due to my liking of Rachel Bilson. I liked her acting in ""The O.C"". So I started without any expectations but found it interesting.During the starting scenes it reminded me of StarsHollow in Gilmore Girls.",2011
9,"Simply put, absolutely charming. If you're not entertained, you may just have a heart of stone. Possibly the best thing on t.v. since Northern Exposure. This is the first I've seen of Rachel Bilson so I can't compare it to the other shows mentioned in other reviews. She admirably carries the heavy load, with tons of absolutely flawless supporting players. The simmering animosity between her and the quintessential Southern Belle, Lemon, is priceless. Jaime King as Lemon Breeland is absolute Southern perfection. She is the embodiment of Southern charm. Tough as nails, wickedly condescending, at times just plain mean. Then tragically vulnerable. You just want to hug the stuffing out of her!",2012
10,"Good entertainment! I look forward to heading South once a week, where so many of my friends reside. The characters are delightful, the scenery lovely, and the small town values and foundations a good reminder to this Westerner. Southern charm with just the right amount of tension and complications of real life. A lot of people have collaborated well to make this a cohesive series. The actors are well-cast; believable. I'd enjoy seeing some 60-70 year old people in the cast, portrayed with more diversity, as the younger actors are. So far, dithering, alcoholic and dead are the characterizations in this demographic-my age bracket. We're far more than that! Perhaps in the seasons to follow I'll see this enrichment added. It's my hope that this series will not only continue, but that the writers will develop and deepen the essential premise of this terrific program. I believe that any television show that can open our nations' viewers to a wider portrayal of another region is valuable. References and responses to real events, such as Katrina, on this program, help unify us, by portraying our similarities country-wide. Hart of Dixie is already able to show our differences with humor and poignancy. Keep up the good work, and stay on the air. I look forward to continuing to follow this series.",2011
2,"Tried to watch. Interesting premise done much better in a Michael J. Fox movie titled 'Doc Hollywood.' Rachel Bilson looks cute in her cute little hot pants, but she needs to take a few acting classes! Every line she delivers and every action she takes is indicated and it drives me nuts. Had to stop watching after 5 episodes. Couldn't take the phony. A show like this can be funny and heartfelt AND well-acted at the same time. Rachel, take some acting classes with a great teacher who won't let you get away with indicating...for the sake of growing your career. Soon, the cute will no longer work for you.",2012
10,"I miss this show so much!!! I loved it so much that I literally felt like I lived there. Their lives were my lives. I related a lot to the characters because I'm from a small town in the south, and it makes me ""feel at home"" when I watch it. Also, I wish that my town was like Bluebell. They all come together as a family when needed most, and I wish I lived some where like that. I really, really wish they would do a season 5 so that I could find out what happens with Wade & Zoe's baby, Lavon & Lemons relationship, & what happens with George & Annabeth!! Please bring it back! I think that they're a lot of people who would love to see it come back! I first found out about Hart of Dixie while scanning through Netflix , and I was immediately hooked. I binge watched the first 3 seasons, and then it came down to season 4 and it wasn't on there. I searched high and low to find it, and finally found most of it on the CW's app. Please, please bring it back! Love -a dedicated fan of The Hart of Dixie!",2015
10,"Hart of Dixi is the definition of ""feel good"" TV. I am all to quick to seek out big time drama but so glad I gave this a chance! It is light and is def a good escape at the end of a tough day. Very, June Clever-ish. The stereotypes are fun and you fall in love with each character as they develop more and more. The rumors of cancellation is my reason for reviewing... I would love to see the show live on! I find myself craving the ""mood"" of the show and have started to go for round 2! I am not one to watch a show twice but it's more than just the story-line that brings me back for more. In most series, the story-line is all that keeps me watching, and once that is over, so is my attention. Hart of Dixi will not overwhelm you with drama but has just enough to keep you hooked. It brings such a unique pleasure/mood, you are sure to fall in love with the town of Blue Bell :) I know my little review is nothing when it comes to the renewal of a show but hopefully, there are enough Hart of Dixi fans out there to speak up and encourage the show to live on!!",2015

9,"Very nearly didn't review Hart of Dixie - a lot of the the positive reviews echoed my feelings though a lot of their references to other shows just flew past me. I'd never seen any of them (except Northern Exposure and, sorry, the two show have little in common).",2014
1,"It is hard to see were the writers Goldstein and Butler are going this season they had ruined the concept of hart of Dixie by bringing in the 2 most awful actors Joel and Lynley I think it is time the writers start to listen to the fans otherwise this show will end up on the scrap heap the way a lot of shows go there is no hope of a season 4 if it keeps going the way it is. Most fans want to see Zoe and Wade together and Lynley out of the show the way they took Ruby Jeffries out of season 2 her voice just grates on me and as for being a spoilt brat as if telling annabeth the dress she wore in the 2nd episode was for a younger girl if I was annabeth I would have slapped her and as for Lavon annabeth should just leave him, he is quickly becoming a pain in the backside the way he treats annabeth she is much too good for him. Joel has to go he did nothing but put Zoe down in last nights show. Zoe needs wade to bring her back on track and be the person she was, with Joel we don't see that person.",2014

9,"The title - is the best there is for this TV show , cant be another title. The show has Rachel Bilson main character. Rachel Bilson - is a very good actress , hope ""Hart Dixie"" will be a long series TV show. What i like the most is her voice , i'm watching few series currently but this one is good , i think i can say it will be at least as good as ""The O.C"" standards , only that one was orange county with beaches and students and a lot of drama , this one is more of a comedy and i saw that romance isn't included in the style but from what i saw in the first episode i do think is romance included. I like doctor TV shows so i will say this one is a good deal .",2011
9,"I don't care what the negative reviews say, they are just being critical. the show definitely has a feel good attitude. people are saying Rachel bilson is a bad actor? i think she plays the role great. shes cute, awkward and sweet lol come on. you don't like it? don't watch it. doesn't mean it deserves a bad review. All the characters mess well together, the jokes are a little quirky and make you laugh a little. people need to be more open minded when watching television shows. many have negative aspects or area of acting, writing or production; (even top rated ex game of thrones haha) but most have many positives aspects as well! maybe i just respect it all.. :)",2014
9,"As a paralegal from the north who wound up working at a divorce, criminal-defense, and bankruptcy firm in Albany, GA for four months, I can relate to this show, which serves up a slice of upscale southern living in generous, stereotypical, yet delicious heaps.",2014
10,"I started watching this Hart of Dixie recently on Netflix while home sick for the weekend. I hadn't ever heard of this show before, but the premiere episode was so good that I couldn't stop watching it. Three days later and I'm already on episode 24!!! I absolutely love it! I was born and raised in the south, but now live on the west coast in one of the largest cities in America. This show takes me back to life as a child growing up sipping sweet tea on the front porch swing and eating homemade peach pies on Sundays at the church picnics. So refreshing to finally watch a show that I am comfortable letting my kids watch too. We all can hardly wait to sit down on the couch and escape to a small town south of the Mason Dixon Line in the midst of our big city lives. Thank you CW for this really heartwarming show!!!!",2012
9,"Beautiful setting , funny dialog , just pure comedic relief ! It's one of those shows that is intense but at the same time very warm and fuzzy. You get a great comfortable family feel from watching it! =) I love this show ! The Hart of Dixie however focuses on a topic that is common among all - we have all been left lost , trying to figure out who we are and we've all been through the feeling of alienation , the sense of a loss of identity once our familial sense of belonging has been dissolved .. It's a show that speaks to us all with problems that aren't too far fetched! (I love the pretty little liars but cmon.. their problems are hardly common place!) Truly an incredibly delight <3",2012
9,"Brenda Blethyn is the best. Only in England would they make a terrific mystery series about a frumpy middle aged woman who leads a homicide squad. No romance, no sex, just plain good mystery and terrific acting. I have just finished all 8 episodes and cannot wait for the next season. If you enjoy brainy mysteries and fabulous cinematography then this series is for you. DCI Vera Stanhope is sometimes temperamental, often blunt, rude and then kind and compassionate. She seems so alone and damaged but her work is her therapy and Her relationship with her Sargent (David Leon) is a thing of beauty. It is mother-son, sometimes best friends, and occasionally adversarial though it is obvious they are devoted to one another. These are murder mysteries that are complex, character rich and rooted in the personal histories of those involved. These stories are not dependent on gore and shock value but are smart, intelligent thrilling puzzles that draw you in for the ride. Watch one and I guarantee you will become a fan!",2014
7,"""Vera"" is a British crime series in the vein of ""Blue Murder"", except that the female chief inspector here is single and has just about no personal life; her partner is a much younger man, married with three kids, so their relationship is strictly on a business / mentor-student level. The series is very well-made: photography, music, camera-work are all exemplary. The mysteries are hard to guess. The acting is excellent by the regulars as well as the guest stars. Brenda Blethyn creates a very real character as the grumpy but compassionate Vera, and David Leon is solid as her low-key partner who is eager to learn from Vera, but eager to help her be more open to people as well. Paul Ritter plays (very well) a forensic pathologist with a macabre sense of humor. The series is very sad, dark and depressing: it dwells on the feelings of loss of those close to the murder victim(s) in each case, and usually there is not much catharsis at the end; the resolution of the cases often leaves most people involved in an even worse spot than they were at the start, before their secrets and sins were exposed. It's definitely not a program to watch when you need something to lift your spirits. I'd also recommend letting some time pass between watching the episodes instead of watching them one after the other like I did, because otherwise they may start to feel a little formulaic in the second season.",2013
10,"Love this series...only downside is they make me feel cold! :-) The weather where it's filmed is terrible! So different from Southern California where I live. It's really great to see a smart mature woman as the lead. At least she's not a 20 year old blonde bimbo! Too many series in the US are full of the tall skinny blondes...boring! This is true of many of the British series that make it over to the United States. They are full of characters who look like REAL people and not Hollywood starlets or runway models. You see the same in ""Scott and Bailey"", another British TV series I really love. I wish we'd see more of British dramas and comedies. I'm sure I'm not alone in wanting the quality of programs the Brits put on. Keep up the great work.",2014
7,"Inspector Morse's departure from our screens and lives left a gap that was not easy to fill, but Vera seems to have stepped right into his shoes. Brenda Blethyn is a talented actress who brings life to the well-written plots of this new TV crime drama. The setting, in and around Newcastle, is charming too, very different from gritty inner city dramas as well as from picture perfect villages that are typically the sites of crime shows. The relationship between Vera and her sergeant mirrors that of Morse and Lewis (the single work obsessed detective and his long-suffering family oriented colleague). While Morse as a fifty-something bachelor was presented as an oddly desirable, enigmatic, man with his occasional liaisons, Vera as a fifty-something single woman is depicted as lonely and frumpy. Morse's love of booze was endearing; Vera's is merely pathetic. This is, sadly, a realistic comment on the different ways in which single men and women are perceived the world over. Unlike Morse, which was pretty much a two-character series, this one involves the larger detection team as well. The resolution is not the result of inspired, instant, intuition, but careful detection. I watched the series in reverse order, and preferred series 2 to series 1; the second episode of the second series is superb.",2012
9,"""Vera"" is a sort of cross between ""Columbo"" (with its slightly disheveled, idiosyncratic protagonist wearing a raincoat and driving a beat-up auto), ""Kojak"" (with the protagonist often ill-tempered and lacking patience with her subordinates and others) and ""Wallander"" (with desolate landscapes and grisly murder a-plenty). Brenda Blethyn is a superb actor and someone with a strong allure as the sharpest cop on the block by far. The plots are very intricate but the characters seem less wholesome than, say, in ""Foyle's War"" or other cop dramas, which is good because the overall theme is murder in contemporary England, which lacks the historic charm of period pieces. The Brits do this sort of thing very well, and one can only imagine that the reason these shows don't make prime time network TV in the US is because too many Americans would have trouble understanding the accents. It is also slow moving, which adds to the mood very nicely, and one can imagine Americans losing patience because there isn't enough poppy theme music a-la Jerry Bruckheimer. (I am an American, by the way, before you think I'm dissing the US.) Each episode is 90 minutes without commercials, so they are all like movies in themselves, just as with ""Wallander,"" ""DCI Banks,"" and others in the genre. Highly recommended.",2014
9,"Vera has developed into the must watch Crime drama series on our screens, I've read all the reviews on here with great interest, Inspector Morse left a massive void, Vera has definitely grown into a show worthy of filling the void.",2016
10,"The plot lines always seem to grab our attention. My husband and I actually enjoy Vera's character. To me she seems like a female version of Colombo, but she is not quite as corny--instead she is more human...just as clever and determined...never giving up until she finds the killer. I think one needs to develop a taste for British detective stories (they are not nearly as ""glamorous"" as American whodunits) in order to enjoy watching them. We also notice the same actors appearing and reappearing in different series, inevitably playing a variety of different character types. We find British shows well-written and often more original than their American counterparts. In fact, when we started watching British shows we could barely understand the actors and now we are quite comfortable listening to British English. So many excellent shows would never be available in the US if we didn't have public broadcasting. Thank you public television for hours and hours of commercial-free entertainment and a variety of intelligent, stimulating dramas from which to choose.",2014
10,"I have to totally disagree with the previous reviewer who said Vera's character isn't believable. Certainly Vera is moody and temperamental (aren't we all flawed in some ways?),but she gets the job done and gets her team to produce results. While she has her own demons, she's tenderhearted when she needs to be and ultimately kind to her staff if they do their jobs and deserve her kindness. The way she gets people to tell her things is calculated, but the method works on the show and in real life. I find the acting in ""Vera"" to always be superb, and the plots are clever, fresh and full of surprises. Also, David Leon (Joe) is gorgeous--and this from a 75-year-old woman. I'll miss him in upcoming episodes, but I'm sure the shows will still be top quality. Vera is one of the reasons this U.S. Midwesterner has become a fan of British TV. Aside from public television, sports and a couple of series, I hardly watch any U.S. TV anymore.",2015
10,"A perfect blending of superb acting, brilliant dialogue, exceptional photography, somber, moody landscapes and an understated and totally appropriate musical score all result in just about the best detective mystery program I've seen on TV. Totally believable and never overdone. A must see program.",2017

9,"I'll make this review short, English not being my native language.",2015
8,"Just think of all the extremely well written, well made crime series from the UK and add this one to the list! Brenda Blethyln brings to life the whip smart, eccentric, disheveled inspector Vera. A bit like a female Columbo. Filmed in the desolate, spooky, dreary NE part of England that itself makes for the perfect backdrop for murder mysteries. A well rounded team of supporting actors bring it home. I only wish I'd found it earlier, but stumbling upon it in its sixth season makes for some wonderful evenings of binge watching! Not too many strong female DI leads are out there. Brenda Blethyln carries her part seemingly effortlessly. She's absolutely in the same class as Joan Hickson. One series not to be missed.",2016
8,"What a relief to have a good detective series back on the tele that doesn't rely on bad language, bad acting, shock topics and model style looks of the main character. Blenda Blethyn, with her ""pet""s and ""luv""s is just delightful as the down to earth, emotionally damaged but very clever detective Vera. She allows herself to be stripped back to basics, dressed in frumpy clothes, often shot at unflattering angles, and by doing so ""becomes"" Vera. As for Vera herself, what a woman to work with! I don't think I'd last long if I were poor old Kenny but the fact that everyone does stick around and work well together getting good results shows that Vera, although in all appearances is so ordinary, she really is extraordinary.",2015
10,"The mysteries are fun, but the main draw here is the incomparable Brenda Blethyn. She is always excellent but Vera is a character she was born to play. She hits every note perfectly. She is fascinating to watch. I would love to one day fall down in front of her and have her call me ""love.""",2017
8,"and since the announced appointment of Cressida Dick as the country's most senior police officer,old - time detectives like her will be looking over their shoulders at the new breed of ambitious female cops,university - educated(Oxford and Cambridge - way to go Cressie),media - savvy,well - groomed and impeccably PC,everything Vera isn't nor would she want to be. But what she can do - which they will never be able to - is look someone in the eye and know if they are lying.That's not on any college curriculum I'm afraid. In last night's episode,as subtle as an enraged bull,Vera crashed her way through an elaborately organised revenge plot and slapped the cuffs on the suspect whilst her hands were still greasy from her fish and chips. No hand - reared calf's liver and drizzled jus for her. It's a one - woman show of course,with the magnificent Miss B.Blethin a Pierre Cardin - free zone with a rainhat permanently on her head and apparently wearing her jammies under her coat,a defiant gesture to the 21st century and it's ""progress"". If you remember when detectives had major Brylcreem,broken noses and dandruff mixing with the fag -ash(and that was only the women)you'll treasure Vera for her compassion,insight into the human condition and her reliance on the old time values. If you want your coppers peering out from behind a computer screen and frightened to say boo to a goose then watch something else.",2017
10,"DCI Vera Stanhope and her various supporting characters reach out and grab you. There's no way to express the raw emotions that we feel when we watch each and every episode. From Season 1 through Season 5 we've held on waiting for the next season to show up, watching the episodes from first to last over and over again. There is always something new to notice, another detail to pick up. The brooding landscape feeds the story and the story feeds the landscape in a cycle that somehow makes the moors and the chill countryside part and parcel of each other. Led by the incomparable Brenda Blethyn the cast is superb and the characters are impeccably played. ",2016

It follows in the great footsteps of Miss Marple, Midsomer Murders, etc. Very tastefully done. It has great believable characters, story lines, and provides wonderful entertainment. It is like sitting down with a good mystery novel and looking forward to each new chapter. We need more shows like this. Where else can you see an average middle aged woman head up a detective squad with all her vulnerabilities yet very dominating personality. You just can't help liking her. She draws you in and keeps you wondering what's next. She could use stronger detective (office) cast support.",2016
10,"Vera is brilliant ! Very interesting storylines, great cast of characters, a lot of humanity. However, what used to be even more brilliant (compared to most English detective series where you can bet that while the rich may be portrayed as selfish and with a lot of secrets the murderer will almost always be someone poor )in Vera the criminal could be rich or poor, of high or low social standing..and that was a great antidote. I have watched the first two in this series , and it seems to be reverting to the typical class bias of most english detective series.",2018
4,Blethyn is a joy and her young sidekick a pleasure to watch but good as they are they can do nothing for the thinly spread barely believable plots and the clod-hopping scripts. The rest of the cast are hardly memorable and some of the minor characters are played by actors who are barely adequate. And who decided that all the characters should speak with the same accent? Someone obviously thinks that all Geordies talk in this cute folksy way no matter what their position in society. Newcastle is a vibrant city and Northumberland breathtakingly beautiful but you wouldn't think so if all you had to go on was this dreary presentation. This series is very disappointing for anyone who has read Anne Cleeves original novels.,2013
4,Not particularly believable lead detective suffers from eating the scenery and over emoting. Blethyn's character detracts from the stories which range in quality from just believable to unwatchable.,2013
1,The character is totally unbelievable. We have this supposed detective dressed like some bag lady (apologies to real bag ladies) roaming around crime scenes trashing forensic evidence giving spontaneous opinions that lead to the detection of the culprit.Serving and retired police officers must be either laughing or crying at the misrepresentation of the police service. She appears to have only one change of clothes and can someone please burn that hat she insists on wearing. Please can someone pension Vera off asap as Brenda Bleythn deserves better roles than this.This is a travesty and an appalling totally unbelievable series. Lets campaign for better TV.,2016
5,"A one-woman show featuring a sixty-something lead, forty pounds overweight with an apparent cardiac condition. This may be the first series in which the title character drops dead from natural causes in the middle of the episode. No one's done that since Moliere!",2012
3,"Gloomy, shiveringly depressing, ""Vera"" is beautifully filmed with impressive production values, in low monotones to set a consistent mood. The plots are weirdly desperate, the music lugubrious, and the resolutions formulaic.",2015
5,"Let's start out with the bad first and end with the good. As they say, the last thing said is the first thing remembered. That grating voice and pushy attitude is way over-the-top. I almost get nosebleeds listening to that nag whine. I truly prefer shows from the UK. They are normally so much better than that puerile ginned-up Hollyweirdo tripe forced down the US populace. What our elites over here lack in originality we make up in stupid scripts and moronic political pandering - something I can do without. This show has superb writing- the plots are in depth yet easy to follow. The scenery...ah the scenery...without CGI...OMG...drop dead gorgeous. Nice, Vera nice. I really think the directors do the absolute best with the cards they are dealt. My only problem is with the main character. Hand me a chalkboard and a thousand fingernails running across the surface...it would be an improvement. Watch this show for content alone...and you have a winner...otherwise...take an aspirin first.",2016
5,"I had been looking forward to Captain America for about a year, and I decided to make it the first premiere I'd go to all summer.

2,"Gee, what a waste of money. I was unfortunate enough to catch a viewing of this, uh, film on its opening night. And I honestly had high expectations. But, not unlike Thor, it fell very VERY short. ",2011
8,"With the imminent ""Avengers"" movie coming next year, only one hero's origin story remains untolduntil now. Falling in line with ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Captain America"" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of ""Wolfenstein"" style occult mystique and a slight ""Indiana Jones"" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it's all good fun.",2011
9,"As there's something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, ""The Rocketeer"", ""Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"" (1999) and, of course, ""Captain America"".",2011
8,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.",2011
10,"I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.",2012
1,"I didn't get what the fuss is all about until i saw the movie and realised it's a feel good movie for Americans then why bother releasing it in other countries . If ever there was a comic book movie not supposed to release outside u.s. it's this movie , a man covered in stripes branded with stars looking like an American clown fighting with dozens of Nazis,oh sorry hydra-what?,exactly . Overall this movie had no good action sequences to speak of , an almost forgettable climax , all our hero does is throw an olympic discus provided by howard stark and almost always looks like an average superhero with nothing special,either in charisma(contrary to batman) or powers(contrary to almost every other superhero). I left the movie halfway through , intolerable to say the least .",2011
9,"I really liked this movie. Saw it last night and I really enjoyed the way they portrayed a superhero that doesn't have any powers. Captain America is not really a superhero, just a super soldier, he doesn't get tired and he heals extremely quick. The acting was very good, what with all the big names in there, and there is always the humor that is enjoyed throughout these Marvel films. Some stuff was unnecessary, like the way they have Captain America just go and be an idol and people not think he can do anything. But I really liked it, and I would recommend it to everybody who likes any of the Marvel films. Anybody who can't stand these films like Spider-man or Iron Man, really shouldn't expect anything more than another superhero movie.",2011
10,"""Rocketeer"" director Joe Johnston's ""Captain America"" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern,"" ""Captain America"" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two ""Fantastic Four"" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, ""Captain America"" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of ""Captain America,"" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.",2011
9,Captain America has Star Spangled Action,2011
8,"I was truly lucky to catch a preview screening of Captain America and i am ever so grateful because Cap is without a doubt one of the best Marvel-hero films of all time. Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America, having his extremely heroic tendencies and his weaknesses (you see them progress from the beginning of the movie). He has no terrible lines and, coming from a comic-book fan, knows how to fill the shoes of a superhero without any real powers, during WWII. Joe Johnston was a fantastic choice as the director, with a pretty good 'track record' behind him (Hidalgo, Jurassic Park III, Jumanji, October Sky). Joe truly knows how to show us a sci-fi story during a historic time period without having any hiccups or mistakes that could bring the movie down greatly.",2011
8,"2011 is certainly the year for Marvel Studio, seeing that Thor came out earlier in the year to good reviews and a healthy box-office considering he is a lesser known hero and Captain America has done even better with critics and a stronger opening. Added to that Fox's reboot of X-Men was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.",2011
8,"Despite going in with incredibly low expectations, I was horrendously disappointed by Thor. It was everything I hoped it would not be, and made me worry about Captain America: The First Avenger. Even with my excitement over that film, Thor's romp through the desert made me incredibly apprehensive to think Cap's adventure would be worthwhile.",2011
1,At first I really liked this show! I don't really care for Whitney Cummings brand of comedy-I had to watch it without my kids around-but I found it quite funny! Now I find it hard to watch and have made the decision to finish out the season and then I'm done (I think only one more episode! ) Every single line is forced & every single line is an analogy/comparison! The characters are flat as well as the comedy! A comment was made about the actors look like they are reading from cue cards and I 100% agree! The lines usually have nothing to do with nothing! The story line has hit a dead end! It feels like it just has no where left to go! I gave it a whole hearted try but this show has run it's comedy course with me!,2015
1,Life is too short to waste it watching crap like this.,2012
1,"One of the worst ""sitcoms"" I've ever seen in my life. I've never been compelled to write a review on a television show but with something this awful, I had to. The writers must have thought to themselves ""hey, let's create as many annoying characters as we can and cram them all into one show.""",2015
2,"After I first saw the ads for this show, I thought it would be funny. After I saw the first few episodes, I thought it would get better. After I watched the first season, I thought Season 2 would be an improvement. Zero stars for me. This show actually has gotten worse. The acting is so bad it is often excruciating. It seems that the 2 broke girls are just reading punch lines from a cue card. And apparently the writers believe that the more off-color the joke, the funnier. And would somebody please tell the actors that talking really loud does not make this miserably written show any funnier either. I guess the network agrees with me since the shows has been downgraded to the 8:30 time slot. Next stop...Saturday night.",2013
1,"I gave 2 Broke Girls two tries, and I didn't laugh once.",2011
1,"When I first learned of the show, I was excited to see it. I watched one episode and thought... this will be canceled mid season. I can't believe it's still running to tell you the truth. The acting is so bad, it's painful to watch. Each 'punchline' is set up so poorly, you are already cringing before it's said. Even the exits and entrances onto or off the set are forced. It's like watching an audition at an amateur acting studio. ",2014
1,"I admit, I watched the first season of this pretty regularly and it wasn't so bad at first. Yes, the constant punchlines did annoy me even then but at least there was enough real story to let that go. I think I maybe caught of few episodes of the second season because there was something better on in that time slot on another channel. I went to watch it this season and had to change the channel because my eleven year old daughter was in the room. I think I watched about 15 minutes of it and noticed that the script had become nothing but never ending punchlines with extremely dirty and degrading jokes. There was none of the heart that the first season had, which kept me watching it then. I feel bad for the actresses because they seem to be uncomfortable delivering the non-stop joke-book jokes. It seems to me that this is the writers' first attempt at a sitcom. Sitcom stands for ""situation"" comedy. That means that the comedy is supposed to be derived from situations. LOL. You can't just cram a bunch of one-liners in a show and call it a sitcom. The sad thing is, some of the jokes might be funny if they stretched them out and added some real dialogue in between. The raunchiness has gotten completely out of control as well and I am seriously sick of the poor people stereotypes. The character of Max is always like ""I'm poor so I'm a goo guzzling back alley whore"". All her jokes seem to point to that. It's quite degrading to women and it's a very bad stereotype that they seemed to pull out of nowhere. I will never watch this show again. I'd rather stare at a blank wall for 30 minutes.",2014
1,"I honestly have only seen a handful of episodes so if this is a show that is mainly plot driven, I may have missed it (i sincerely doubt it). Here are a few observations about what the writers/producers of the show think: raunchy = automatically funny, saying raunchy jokes louder make them automatically funny, delivering cue-card punchlines in an 80's fashion is still funny. I hear the ""punchlines"" and the laugh track and constantly find myself saying ""was that supposed to be the punchline?"". I like every brand of humor and am extremely easy to please in the humor department, and this show is completely unfunny. I really like Kat Dennings too and was hopeful for this show, but there are only 4 reasons this show is somehow still around: each girl has two of them. If you see any 9 or 10 star ratings anywhere, completely ignore them... they were written by marketers.",2014
1,"Watching 2 Broke Girls or having your brain eaten by zombies... as I sit here forced to watch it, I am wondering which would be worse. There is no dialog as such, just a series of lame punchlines that come every 5 to 10 seconds. All that's missing is a cheesy drumroll, but that would tirn the entire program into a drum solo. The delivery and acting is so bad that your average elementary school nativity play has more talent on offer. The canned laughter punctuates the mindless rhythm of the inane witterings as it drones on and on and on and on and on... It's simply the worst thing I have ever witnessed ever at any time in any country in my life. That anyone could like this in any way is mind boggling.",2015
1,"Well since its first season it has survived on taking pop shots at hipsters when its main audience is hipsters. It uses old and worn out stereotypes about people of different races and nationalities. Poor accents (Nashit indeed) but Sophie and Oleg and Han. All get the stereotype accents. A laugh track that would make The Big Bang Theory editors feel tame in comparison. In the 70's it would have been a great show. Racist and ignorant stuff were acceptable but this is 2015. In a world where we can watch Community and Archer. 2 Broke Girls look outdated. I looked out dated in the pilot. How many times can they make jokes about Han an Asian being short? It wasn't funny the first time. Its not funny now. They patronize Earl. He gets a pedestal because they can't mock African Americans. That's racist but not mocking him the are counter racist. Implying African Americans need protecting because they are different. They revel in mocking Asians, Polish, Irish and the rest of the world. Sometimes racism can be funny if its used as a tool to show how silly racism is but 2 Broke Girls makes cheap shots because its easy. Don't waste your time watching it. Watch Rick and Morty on adultswim.",2015
1,"I was visiting friends in the third world today, and while they were browsing their version of basic cable I saw this show airing on channel one billion or whatever. At first I was amazed that banal basic ""jokes"" followed by laugh tracks still existed in the 21st century, thought it was an old show or something.",2016
3,"I've watched a few episodes and keep thinking it might get better because some people rate it highly and it's touted as good on some media. I just can't like it. I thought it was horribly unfunny at first and wanted to give it a chance before reviewing. Kat Denning(Max) has an irritating voice that could be put to good use if she could act. She has a few funny one-liners, but she sounds like she is reading her lines. Jennifer Coolidge(Sophie) has been a very funny character in movies, but I can't put my finger on why she is so bad in this TV show. The men-(Earl, Oleg and Ha Lee) are not likable. The only redeeming character may be Beth Behrs(Caroline). She can actually act. There are some humorous moments and that is why I rated it a 3. I wish I could give it more because of the few times when it has some comedy that is appealing. Great premise but missing the mark. I wish they would get off the TV to make room for something better.",2014

1,"I would give it zero stars if I could. I was shocked when I was flipping through the channels and saw this show; I honestly don't understand why it's still on the air. I watched it to see if anything had changed since the first season. Nope! The acting, if you can call it that, by the two main actresses is horrendous. Speaking very loudly and looking like you're trying really hard not to look at the camera (or worse, looking like you're reading off of cue cards off-set) is not acting. The jokes are not funny and you can see them coming a mile away. Put this thing masquerading as a situation comedy out of its misery!",2016
9,"I've seen all of the episodes that are out to date, and from the first episode I knew this was a show for me! I mean, the plot is not supposed to be plausible, it's supposed to be comedy, and a feel good show, and that's exactly what it is, with a little cynical twist added from Kat Dennings. Kat Dennings run the show, and she is the main reason I follow this series. For people who like Kat Dennings kind of humor, this is a show for you, where she gets to play a little more freely with her puns than she has been able to do previously in movies and other shows. I love it!It might not be a very popular show, like Glee or all these other vampire shows that people are into now, but that's why I like it, it's plain and simple, back to old school stories of the rich and the poor, but I'm not gonna be surprised if this is one of those shows that aren't gonna be around for long since it's not main stream popular. It's a shame if it wont last.",2011

It doesn't feel relatable or realistic at all. Nobody talks like how these people do in the show. It seems like the writers just try to write up as many sexual jokes as they possibly can and try to throw them in one after another. Its just horrible. The acting is also pretty terrible. At least if they had some hot girls, it would have redeemed the show a little bit. However, Kat Dennings is uglyyy. All she has is some massive tits. The other girl is not attractive either and unfortunately doesn't even have a rack to compensate. She also has a super annoying whiney voice. Honestly, I'm surprised this show has even survived as long as it has. This show really needs to be axed.",2014

The only attraction this show has to offer is Kat Dennings. Nothing says ratings like a low cut waitress uniform and cleavage; it's what sells this show.. without her it'd be more of a huge flop. It's like Unhappily Ever After; that awkward TV show spin-off of Married with Children. No humor, weak plot and poor acting but factor in the mouth watering Nikki Cox and you've got yourself at least a few seasons worth of tight pants and low cut whatevers'. I hate TV shows that sells cleavage or any other female body part just to get ratings; I mean come on is that what producers need to do in order to gain an audience? And who writes these story lines?

My review sounds something like this: Most forced, weakest acting since I was in high school drama club for starters, by every actor, the seasoned ones to the idiots all around. To follow up, the premise is so pathetic that I cannot fathom someone sold it to any network. Perhaps sexual favors were exchanged. I suppose I could go on about the horrible construction of the sets but I will end with one positive note. The waitress outfits are outstanding....for a teenage boy. Nice and short skirts with all the right parts showing. Any man that watches this is staring directly at Kat's upper body, ignoring the absolutely hideous voice of hers and imagining....well you know where this is going. End this program now please!",2014
8,"The idea of a ""classic"" director like Kenneth Branagh making a superhero film might initially sound strange, but in the case of Thor that ended up being very appropriate, because the comic always used Shakespearean drama and archaic language to tell the story of the God of Thunder, the political/family conflicts in the Asgard kingdom and its interaction with the universe of Marvel Comics. And Branagh's competent direction, the excellent performances and the solid screenplay make Thor to be a very entertaining movie.",2011
8,"In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.",2011
3,"Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character.",2011

9,"Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!",2011

1,"This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.",2011
1,"Hmmm, Thor where do I begin? I have long since given up the erroneous notion that superhero movies should be true to its comic book counterparts. I also have lived long enough to see superhero titles rebooted so often that they bear no r...resemblance to their origins as told in my youth (Jane Foster is an astrophysicist stormchaser?) So, I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing, too, because if I had any, they wouldn't have been met. First, I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.",2011
1,"First of all, after seeing both, I'd recommend you watch this movie in 2D. It is one of the worst comic book adaptations I've ever seen. All the fight scenes happened to fast and you could barely see it if you watch it in 3D, all the female characters are portrayed as useless idiots and if you haven't read the comic book this movie will not make any sense. Just don't waste your money. It has ruined my childhood. The plot was strung together very loosely as well. Don't get me wrong, some of the acting was very good. For example, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddlestone really brought this screen to life when they were given time behind Chris Hemsworth and his horribly cheesy acting.

1,"Why aren't there any fans working for this movie?! I saw this movie with my brother. We are two fans of comic-book heroes. I admit I went to the movie thinking ""Why did they not cast that viking from 13th Warrior?"", ""Why are they going for the cute guy instead of making Thor really scary and north like?!"". The reason: Hollywood is getting stupider with every film. No more suspense, no more nothing. Money, money, money.... See this movie once and then never again. The acting is awful, Natalie Portman is done making good movies and I feel so bad that Anthony Hopkins really involved his name in this movie. P.S.: Thor's hammer looks like it's made of plastic, same as Green Goblins plastic outfit from Spider Man 1.",2011

Regardless of how bad the story is. At what point do people STOP spending their money on silliness and demand an intelligent story. Fortunately for me, I saw this movie for free. Thank God! As quoted by Thor in this abominable movie: ""For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do"". As bad as this movie is, I can understand why. At this point, I have been told that I do not have the 10 lines required to comment about this movie. So let me repeat once again, this movie is bad, bad, bad! And not in a good way.",2011

Don't worry readers I am not about to give away one single spoiler, however after some time and anticipation, Thor is a winner. Australian Chris Hemsworth graced the red carpet in all his native glory, talking up the film and his future entity in The Avengers. He was joined by Shakespeare aficionado Director Kenneth Brangh and co stars Jamie Alexander & Tom Hiddleston who plays crowd favourite Loki. Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks. Costumes rock, not to mention the obligatory Marvel characters making significant cameos, not just the extra scene after the credits, but within the film itself. I was a little over superhero movies recently but this is not to be missed.",2011

2,"This series started with an already old but always appealing story: a family moves in a haunted house. The first episodes were promising but it all went downhill. This is one of those series where the writers lose their imagination all of a sudden. There are ghosts who behave like humans and, after the body being killed and buried still appear and have human behaviour (having sex with humans, going to a bar and having a drink with humans, etc...). There are tons of characters (ghosts) that bring nothing new to the series. -The series gets boring really quick since 90% of the action is inside the same house (and these are 40-50 minute long episodes).",2012

For the main characters, history is what the first episode is all about: the husband's history of infidelity, the wife's history of having a bloody stillbirth, the daughter's history of cutting herself -- for each a long history of pain and resentment and longing for change, though it quickly becomes apparent the only change coming will leave them hysterically screaming to the sudden, violent, gory end. The one sure thing this show promises is that people will die horribly, and we will all be terrified by it.",2011

Thankfully the people who made this know what they are doing. If you are a horror buff you will understand what I am talking about after a couple of viewings. It could have been so easy to make a high school shock fest all wrapped up for a safe and appropriate viewing experience. This show is weird, deranged, creepy, and best off all well acted and well written. Great character development that is based on things people would actually do if they faced that situation. This show really does have a bright future if they keep rolling at this pace. I must say, I am very impressed. Almost Walking Dead impressed. This show though is way more deranged then Walking Dead though. Keep it up F.X. . You have a potential winner on your hands. This show of course is not for everybody. The people who don't like it would be better served by watching something a little more tame and mediocre like Tera Nova.",2011

I wonder at what were the authors of this show, whether they are drugged or mad because such a large amount satanic perversion, brutality, slaughtering, and the total absurdity of exercising their own demented fantasy is difficult to invent by normal person. Above all, the show has no longer the charm and originality as a second season, and this is just the accumulation of shallow, cheap grotesque scenes that shocking viewers. And merge them with quite stupid dialogues. All in all, a great disappointment and hope that something like this will never make again! Pity.",2014

1,"I have decided to watch this series, on account of the generally favourable reviews and furthermore, because I found the idea of filming a second season for a horror TV series a recommendation in itself. After the tedious labor of watching every second of the pilot, I found all the rants and raves for this show completely unjustified. As a matter of fact, everything about it is unjustified except for the title, of course. American Horror Story is the perfect choice, since the series embodies all the cliché themes of the horror movies that keep sprouting out of Hollywood every fall. A family haunted by the ghosts of the past, an even more haunted house, tales of murder and madness, the shadows of whom still lurk between the walls. Indeed, an overdone cocktail of clichés such as this couldn't have possibly failed as miserably as its predecessors on the big screen. The first two episodes where more than sufficient to convince me of the lack of quality of the show. The choice of actors is a particularly applaudable example of severe miscast. The Dylan McDermott we all know and love for his ability to perform without credibility and traces of mimic, an underacting and boring Connie Britton, the teen actress Taissa Farminga, who fails to develop her character into a believable teenager, Evan Peters, who actually manages to turn the psychopath he is supposed to portray into a laughable goth poser (without the outfit, naturally) and Jessica Lange, who seems to have put just enough effort into her character as to alternate from scene to scene between the former roles of Blanche DuBois and Martha Baring. The fact that the story is concoction of horror movie clichés cannot be stressed enough, yet I must make a short comment on the dialogue: each scene gave me the impression that the script was nothing more than a collage of dialogues from the other Hollywood failures of the horror genre, some gore and some scary face popping on the screen (to the horror movie fan's dismay, not quite difficult to predict). That's the way a multitude of clichés tend to affect the viewer. The utter lack of suspense and the ridiculous soundtrack (out of context for almost every scene), added to the above mentioned (mis)cast and the plot rightfully accompany my decision to not take this series seriously and to not recommend it.",2012

1,"Everyone around me is seeing something in this show that I can't. I'll admit that the first and second episode of the first season were passable after the first viewing, but it all went downhill from there. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk simply cannot write. I try to overlook all of the stupid, subtly over the top lines but it's impossible. There are just too many ha ha. Even if I could, they break one of the most important rules in writing television and movie: show, don't tell. Within the first few minutes of the season three premiere, Taissa Farmiga's character, Zoe, says ""So, apparently I'm a . Aside from that, the acting is sometimes melodramatic and terrible, yet the actors are ones that I normally enjoy: at least to some of them. The storyline like the show in general is disorganized. Pointless, unnecessary things tended to be piled on and on until I just stopped caring. Sorry to be so harsh. No judgment, watch away ;] I just don't understand.",2014

I expect in the next ones to meet werewolves, the Loch Ness monster, voo-doo, giant insects, jason, freddie krueger, cenobites, organs market, the blair witch project, a virus, the sacrifice of a kid, Satan gangs, an atomic bomb hidden under the holy virgin and maybe the resurrection of Hitler. The script is SO WEAK that I'd rather watch a Z- movie instead. Watch ""666 Park Avenue"" and see how a clean script with a nice studied idea can make you enjoy a TV horror series.

2,"I watch a fair amount of TV and think that I have fairly selective tastes in shows, but Suits was one of my favorite recently produced shows. The first season was bold, smart, and very polished. This is one show that definitely deserves HD. Harvey Specter was by far one of the best fictional lawyers out there. One of the best parts of the show was the focus on the ""case of the week"" idea, and all the clever dialog and intricate legal drama that came with it. The third episode with the boardroom battle over control of the car company was a kind of 'everyday-epic.' Another highlight was the inclusion of three very smart female characters: Donna, Rachel, and Jessica. Most notably, the primary characters had a powerful and flawless way about them that justified their ""it's not about caring its about winning"" attitude.",2013

Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications.

I am a person who loves legal dramas, anything with convincing courtroom scenes. The initial premise of an unqualified lawyer with a photographic memory was interesting but this plot was quickly relegated to the back burner. Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all. He was fighting everyone and for what reason ?",2013

The characters are unsympathetic and the plot is all-too mainstream. Frankly, it has been done before (like in the late 90s).",2013

Stay away, and you will not cry for the lost time. Life is too short to waste it in something like Suits.",2014

So far so good. Then came this final series. What a joke! Do the producers actually think that this is entertaining us? The whole premise is about showing facial expressions along with slow hush hush speech. It's shocking. This final episode of Mike going to jail is more like a Laurel and Hardy offering. Add to this the dress sense of the boss of this huge law firm and I can't help howling with laughter. Forget our marriage, forget what the gangsters will do to me in prison, I have to go to jail in order to be true to Harvey said Mike to his Bride to be or not to be.

Yet she's still allowed to be in charge & hold her rank in the CIA while crying at every drop of a hat? Puleeeese! And the Brody character is not only titled an American hero, but he's a Congressman scouted to be the Vice President's running mate. That in itself would be a lot on his plate, but where does he find time to plot terrorist activities, stay abreast of military & presidential affairs, while hiding from press who usually dog any political appointee, and sneak off from his wife & kids while running off to meet Carrie for weekends in little cabins in the woods? Puleeeese! Mandy Pantikin co-stars as Saul,whose been with the CIA 35 years. He trained Carrie & placed her in the field, and though not her boss anymore, he's still protective of her & she looks to him as a mentor. However, she rarely takes his advice these days & constantly runs off on tangents which, in real life, would either get her killed or most likely stripped of rank & fired. I really like Pantikin but sad to see him take on a role of such a complacent character. Give him some spit & fire! Puleeeeese!! I'm bored with it now & probably will drop it altogether.

Not to mention shows like The Shield, 24, etc. Although this time I found myself siding with the villain. Clare Danes makes for a very annoying and unlikeable Jack Bauer clone who over acts every scene with the same three facial expressions.",2012

I didn't have high expectations of it but i had hoped it would at least be moderately entertaining. The show is entirely made up of unlikeable characters. Literally all the main characters are annoying. The CIA agent is a completely unbelievable character that makes it virtually impossible to suspend your disbelief and get into the (weak) story. Her part is poorly acted and scripted and is probably the biggest turn-off of the series for me. Sergeant Brody is so dull, boring and often (again) unlikeable i am left not caring if he's turned or not, which seems to be the supposed mystery of the whole thing. There's very little story so far. It seems like every now and again, one of the main characters will start speaking Arabic (as if that in itself implicates them as a possible terrorist) which seems to be trying to serve as a ""twist"" to draw the series out. What seems to have been forgotten is you can't ""twist"" a story that isn't there yet! That said, anyone who thought Lost was good will probably think this is too, being seemingly of the same formula. I notice others compare Homeland unfavourably to 24. Personally, i'm not a fan of 24. but i can see why fans of that wouldn't like this. There's zero action in Homeland. I can only imagine the most paranoid and xenophobic of viewers really getting into this (which is probably why it won awards). I only gave this 3 rather than zero because i haven't seen it all. As my flatmates are watching it, i'll prob sit in and catch some more and update this review if need be.",2012

In this season the writing has become so frustratingly predictable I am finding myself anticipating things before they happen. They've started an episode and several scenes with lame plot turning monologues that seem super lazy to me. In previous seasons, particularly 1-3, writers wove its story through each episode in a very intriguing way. Now I feel I am being spoon fed plot turns like I've never seen the show, simply put the intelligence of this show has gone way down. Also, this season took some real liberal stabs at predicting the political scene that you can see had to be altered as it went on, not a great way to write in my opinion. Sadly, I won't be watching this show any longer. ",2017

What is the P.O.V.? I know others love this show so it may be just a case of my disliking where others are at psychologically at this dangerous time in history. I don't like a single one of the characters on this show! Also, less than 3 million people watch this show? (That's 3 million more than should, LOL!). O.K., only 1 star for this piece of junk!",2012
4,"Since this season has turned politically correct in Season 6 it is a choir to watch... just finished ep.5 and I will not waste anymore time on this season, will skip the rest and hope the shows writers get their heads out of their asses and start writing better shows. Keep their political correctness out of the show and just get back to writing kickass seasons like the first 4 were.... aaahhhhh!!!",2017
2,"Unfortunately the writers for the season 4 took viewers and fans of the series for morons. The entire chain of events in Islamabad is idiotic and highly unrealistic. If US Embassies operated in such a loose and unprofessional manner, half of them all over the world would have been attacked or infiltrated. In a place like Pakistan the US Embassy is like a fortress and movements of all the personnel are monitored and so are the entrances to the flats of key embassy employees. Spoilers: Ambassador's husband(!?) sneaks into Carrie's flat and switches her pills!? And it works? And he knows the plans of the embassy building secret tunnel?? What?? And one of top Pakistani intelligence people cooperates with CIA Carrie against the wishes of his boss, because... he likes her and it's the right thing to do. What?? Bazukas smash the vehicles with Carrie and Saul to pieces, but surely they come out of it only with minor bruises. Hollywood stuff. The US Embassy's CIA operative goes AWOL and conducts an operation to kill a Pakistani terrorist on his own, against the orders from Carrie. And did I mention he shoots a US guard in the leg when they try to apprehend him. What?? What an unrealistic fairy tale.",2014
1,"The first season left me looking forward to the second. By the end of the second, the plot has become so preposterous and so idiotic, I'm sorry I wasted my time watching any of it. The plot meanders here and there, people get killed, accidents happen, here and there, and to what end? The answer is to keep the show going mindlessly for another season or two. I'm finished. Every American character is a government employee, except for wives and children. Every Muslim is a terrorist. The worst part of the series is the fact that whoever wrote the script obviously had no idea where he was going to go at the start. This has to be (I hope) the nadir of Claire Danes' acting career where she repeats the same horrible affectations-mouth quivering between grimace and grin, and an idiotic wide-eyed look where her corneas become dots in the middle of the whites of her eyes. I'll chalk that up to incompetent directing. The main characters- Carrie and Brody- are deeply despicable, amoral characters who have the same predictable conversations feeding each others' delusions over and over again. The worst part of it is that the producers of this pretentious garbage seem to expect that the viewers have forgotten all about their deeds and have somehow transformed them into sympathetic characters. There isn't a moment of irony, or self-reflection in the entire series. I do think I see a look in Mandy Patinkin's face where he's thinking ""This turkey's even worse than Criminal Minds."" Go and watch The Assets and see how it's done when it's done really well.",2014
5,Well i have started watching this series hoping it would be a thrilling story and after watching 1st season i am quite satisfied with the story line of the series but the main propaganda in this series is to degrade Islam and all Muslim countries...,2013
1,"It's bad enough that, in HOMELAND's fantasy world, the newly elected US president is a Hillary clone, and her adviser is an Obama clone, both of whom think that Iran is a peace-loving nation and that the threat of an Islamic nuclear holocaust is a concoction by the usual suspects, those devious Israelis.",2017
10,"This is a masterpiece of TV thriller/action/drama . Sharp, sophisticated, clear and crisp. Excellent performance of the entire cast.It's realistic tense, action packed 12 hours of just well made TV.!The storyline is crafted in such a brilliant way that from the first episode ,one can not wait to see how the drama concludes. I said realistic , as the cast so brilliantly fit in to their characters. Mandy Patinkin's performance is outstanding as the voice of sanity throughout the events.Claire Danes is having a double role as the CIA agent and as being Bipolar . Finally Damian Lewis:The creators could not have found anyone better to play Nicholas Brody.",2012
10,I have never watched the British version of this show so I cannot comment on the original. I was under the impression it was a new Showtime story. ,2011
10,"I've grown up with the original Shameless. It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.",2011
10,"I was halfway through the American series before I even KNEW there was a British series. I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. ""I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!""",2011
8,Note: I have not seen the UK version.,2011
9,"I don't leave reviews very often but I had to for this show. I have not seen the UK version and don't really care to because this show is just top notch. I had never heard of this show since I work overseas but ended up catching the 5th episode and absolutely loved it. I told all of the guys in the fire station about it and ever since we have had to catch up on all of the previous episodes. Everyone in the department loves this show and that is a hard thing to do. All of the characters are just great and have so many flaws. William H. Macy does an awesome job as the dysfunctional father. I gave it the highest review I think a show can receive because I don't think there is a perfect show, but this comes darn close. I definitely recommend this show.",2011
10,"Many of the reviews on here are complaining about how much the U.S. version copies the original. I've not seen a single episode of the original and, to me, the U.S. version is well acted, entertaining and perhaps one of my new favorites. I could care less that it's word for word from the original because this is all new to me. The actors portray the characters amazingly and I feel the storyline represents struggling families realistically. Each character will remind you of someone you know or have known. So for those who are like me and you've never seen the original, I absolutely suggest checking out Shameless, the U.S. remake. I look forward to seeing the rest of the season and maybe one day I'll even check out the original.",2011
8,I'll start by saying that if you have watched the UK version of this (Which by the way was made by Channel 4 and Company Pictures and NOT the BBC as these other reviews suggest) You probably won't enjoy this first episode. Its a straight transition of the script with some adjustments.,2011
8,"the original British version is one of my favourite shows on TV and when i first heard that they were remaking it in the states, i like many others had serious doubts of it translating well, especially if you think of how glamorous American TV is and how unglamourous a show like shameless is. However i can safely say that John Wells and Showtime really have nailed it in adapting the show for the US audience. this can be said with how successful the show has been in America, which is great because it sort of mimics the same success the UK version had when it debuted in 2004. Despite there being some flaws, Showtime have overall done a terrific job in adapting shameless. ",2012
10,"I cant seem to understand the hate for the American version, i am a huge fan of the Original series, actually the preview for this got me into the original series! after watching the pilot of this, i can say its gonna be good, and its something America needs, besides another ""reality series"" whether you're watching the original or American remake its still a good show. however there are a few things changed in the American remake and they are very subtle changes, like Ian being interested in the military and Liam being black, those are the only huge changes. there were allot of drastic changes made to the original series which made it much better, such as getting rid of some characters and adding a bunch of new ones. lets just hope this remakes gets to live 7 seasons.",2011
4,/* Update Season 4 - warning spoilers*/,2012
9,"I've followed the original version in the UK since it started and it's still going strong (to correct an earlier reviewer it wasn't aired on the BBC, it's a Channel Four series). I therefore approached this with apprehension. To take a loved UK program and set it in the US has a history of failures but I liked the look of the trailer and gave it a go. I have to admit that throughout the first episode I was constantly thinking 'oh she's not as good as so and so' or 'I much prefer David to William'. However there was a lot packed into that episode and the script was pretty good. Come episode two I was hooked and to honest much prefer this version.",2011
8,"I don't know if you can call 2011 the year the BBC invaded American television, but it comes darn close. The first of the shows to premiere in the new year will be Showtime's version of the British award winning Shameless. Shameless follow Frank Gallagher, played by William H. Macy, and his not quite normal family. For instance the youngest of the Gallagher clan is quite obviously not Frank's yet that isn't even the family's biggest concern. Nor would it be the fact that in order to make ends meet and keep the electricity from being turned off all the kids chip in including the youngest daughter who takes up a collection that is supposed to be turned into Unicef. Yeah those are problems alright, but like I said they aren't the Gallagher's biggest problem. Their biggest problem would be Frank and his inability to stay sober long enough to pay more than his bar tab at the neighborhood pub.",2011
9,"I watched a lot of television, and this is the best show on TV!",2012
8,"Outstanding cast, writing and direction. Too bad that it's audience is limited to cable. But certainly only suitable for adult viewers.",2012
10,"It is an absolutely awesome show, a lot of American remakes of British TV shows suck, i.e Skins, but than you get the good ones like Being Human and this. This show pick a bunch of actors who are well suited to their rolls, including Joan cusack, who hasn't seen much lately, but she found her way as a crazy Agoraphobic. The show is entertaining, also includes a great comedic side, but holds it's family drama genre in place, it's interesting to see the outcome of each episode. ",2011
10,I am a big fan of the UK series and expected the US remake to be a diluted and sanitised version of the original.,2011
10,I saw Emmy Rossum's interview with Chelsea Handler & decided to give it a watch. My hopes weren't that high because the USA hasn't done too good a job of bring UK shows over and keeping everything that made them great in the UK. This show demolishes that stereotype. The characters of Veronica and Kevin are definitely the funniest characters on the show. Frank's character makes you hate him to the core but not enough to destroy the show. Fiona is the one you all love and hate you love her for everything she does but sometimes hate her for some of her decisions she makes them for the good of the family not necessarily for the good of herself which isn't what we've come to expect from TV. This show is just amazing & is killing me for making me have to wait until 2012 for season 2.,2011
10,"I feel like Shameless is super underrated! It's a show where drama and comedy make a very good mixture. They strengthen the veracity of the events from the show, because this kind of things represent the cruel and bitter reality we live. It's an amazing show that'll hit you right in the feels. It's one of the most realistic show I've watched. It's an one of a kind show. Oh and... that love/hate relationships with many characters (beacuse you'll have them) will make you love this show even more.",2017
9,"I really enjoyed watching ""shameless"" because the of the great play of actors, and also because of the interesting story. The series feel so alive and real, with all these problems always coming up with the Gallaghers. This family is so messed up and fun to watch, that I can't have enough of one episode at a time, I need like two at once to get satisfied. This poor family, always stealing, cheating and lying to survive, doing drugs and so on, one can never get bored with their chaos and dysfunction. I am planning to watch the original version so that I can compare the both, it's really interesting to see all the characters in another way. A great thanks to the guys that shoot this series. I have not yet watched the original version of ""shameless"", but I am sure that if I do watch the British version, I will still love the both of them the same.",2016
9,"This show put me off at first, but I got hooked because the characters are so likable that I watched Dragonball Evolution. I never had any desire to see that movie before. I've never heard the theme song ""The Luck you Got"" before this show but I really do dig it though. I think this show is very well cast and I can never tell what is going to happen next. It's a very effective break from real life. I suppose the main reason that I like it so much though is because I identify with one of the characters and it reminds me of my crazy ass family. Anyways I'm just trying to raise the rating of Shameless because I want to see more episodes. So watch the show.",2011
10,"This show makes you feel the hard stuff they are feeling right down to even crying or feeling guilty for anything wrong you might have done. It is a show that makes you think about life and helps you make choices. It's like the characters are doing the wrong ones so you don't have to. So sit tight, for you may feel guilty for being in prison from your own couch and then cry at the sight of freedom! The casting director is a genius man! Sheila, Lip and Fiona are a fresh breeze of new acting, while all the rest are simply delightful! All the actors in this series are excellent. Some may say that the script is exaggerated, but once you've seen 3 episodes you will soon realize it's really not! Discover for yourself why!",2014
10,"This is one of my all time favorite shows, I have watched the UK version and the US version and both have their own taste.People who complain about how the story is exactly the same as the UK version is half correct. The American version has characters each person can relate to rich or poor but the premise and reason for connecting with this show stems from the UK story plot. Much like the US version of the show skins (A terrible remake of the amazing British original) (Not supporting it, simply awful) it makes you feel like you could be in it/live like them. If you are reading reviews to tell you if you should watch it....don't, explore for yourself. I love to agree with people and show my opinion that I hope it is picked up for a third season with the same cast. Acting and scene cuts are fluid, and it is simply easy to watch by far nothing new or groundbreaking, just a great time. Other shows I really enjoy are. (no specific order)",2012
9,"I really enjoyed the US version of Shameless Season 1, good humor, interesting characters, I watched all episodes in one day, really breathtaking and enjoyable experience, it became one of my favorite series to date. I have never been a great fan of William H. Macy's roles but I feel he has born to be Frank Gallagher in Shameless. So I recommend season 1 for anyone who want to spend some good time. Season 2 is really uninteresting, as if I am watching a completely different show with different plot and characters. I was really eager to find out what happens with the Gallaghers next, but not anymore. The jokes are not funny, the drama is boring and cliché",2012
9,"Confession first - I usually like British TV shows, but have always found US adaptations lacking. For Instance, I really like the UK version of Being Human, and cannot make myself watch a complete episode of the US version; I would perhaps feel differently if I hadn't seen entire UK version before watching the US version.",2012
