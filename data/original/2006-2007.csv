5,"The first three seasons of this show are the worth to watch. In fact, this show ratings and success is based upon these three seasons. These seasons are mainly about comedy with little to none emotions. But as the show progresses and Leonard, Sheldon and Howard finds their life partners, whole tune of this show changes. You'll find romance, love and emotions with some dose of comedy after that. I think at this point, this show loses its main theme. I am rating it 5 only because of the first three seasons. The quality of show will start to decline gradually after season 3. But i think it shows good depiction of scientists. I also have some scientist friends who have many similarities with the characters of this show.",2016
6,"I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 to 5 with some of the most intellectually-stimulating and subtle humour since Seinfeld. Like physicist Sheldon ""embracing the chaos"" or using classical conditioning techniques on his roommate's girlfriend. But you did need a modicum of (popular) science knowledge to get the jokes, so apparently by season 6 they rolled out the usual array of mindless comedy writers to turn it into a yawn-worthy series of relationship clich√©s and rake in more viewers. When binge-watching it, you also notice disturbing patterns like the demeaning portrayals of both the men and women scientists, for different reasons. Grew up around researchers and no, they were not men-children who spent their time at the comic book store. Actually at my Dad's university they were pretty much all stable family types with successful careers, and there were a few loners, too. Like pretty much any group of humans. Lest people think this review is unfair, I have seen all seasons, hoping for a return to the cleverness of seasons 1-5 but alas it shall not be. This is one series that unfortunately will not go out with a Big Bang, but with a fizzle.",2016
1,"I tried to like ""The Big Bang Theory"". I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.",2012
1,"I used to be a huge Big Bang Theory fan for the first three seasons,but after the 4th season I just think the whole series has become a repetition of the same nerd jokes and false stereotypes.The addition of Amy and Sarah has made it even worse;Howard is no longer a funny d- bag(which I loved him for);Sheldon treats Amy like a computer program and Leonard gets Penny,and now they BOTH suck.",2013
10,"When my boyfriend tuned into the premiere I thought the show was going to be stupid. I was so surprised. This is the first TV show to really showcase nerds with pretty much dead on accuracy. This has a sparkling cast (Jim Parsons is the new and improved David Hyde Pierce) and fantastic humor that ranges from light slapstick to seriously quick wit. This show is a great love letter to nerds, and as such any nerd should give this a try. With a bunch of new (and very lame) shows debuting, it's good to see something worth watching! This premise isn't exactly new but the execution is nothing short of brilliant. Give it a shot!!",2007
5,"Wow.. from my absolute favorite, this show has slowly turned into a sad, sad sight.. I get it: you can write only so many nerd jokes, and you can keep the show funny only for so long, but will you guys please put the BBT out of its misery already?",2016
6,What this review might have sounded like had I written it 7 years ago. ,2017
5,"From about season 1-3 of this show, I genuinely loved it! I got a lot of good laughs, and it is definitely pleasing for the geeks and nerds out there of all kinds! And then the show did something it really shouldn't... add more relationships, and focus on them.",2016
5,"This started as a brilliant show about five single young adults: four nerdy male scientists and a slutty, uneducated waitress. This worked really well. However, the makers decided to ruin this unique and very entertaining formula and put all its main characters - apart from Raj - in long-term relationships. By doing that, they've turned a great new show into yet another mediocre, couples and families sitcom.",2017
4,"This show was pure gold at first when it was just penny and the boys: when Sheldon was never open to the possibility of a relationship because of his social awkwardness and inability to understand people, when Raj couldn't speak with a girl around, and a hot girl moves in. It was genius and hilarious. The introduction of Bernadette and Amy ruined this show. Their characters are awful and intensely annoying and unfunny. Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.",2016
1,"I'm probably in the minority when I say this show is boring. After watching a few episodes of this show, I can attest that it is one of the most terrible sitcoms I have ever seen. It is basically forced comedy with unremarkable jokes, boring stories, and goofy characters.",2013
1,"It's The Simpsons Syndrome all over again: a show that was great in the earlier seasons (in this case, primarily Season 1-3, which I rate as among the greatest put to television), entered a steady decline, and then jumped the shark. It's no great mystery; money has once again corrupted something good.",2016
5,"TBBT used to be one of my favorite shows on TV in the last few years, the show's first 5 seasons were really funny, somehow since season 6 the show started to get worse each episode, the characters were losing what made them once great, the writing wasn't as sharp as it used to be, the show changed from a really funny and smart comedy to a boring dramedy, and the show kept getting even worse, seasons 7 and 8 were even worse than 6, the characters lose all of their funny traits. Even the girls are becoming more annoying, Amy is not funny as she used to be in seasons 4 and 5, she just complains all the time now, Bernadette became unbearable. That's enough for me, I gave up this show, I don't think writers can recover what made the show once great. I give the overall rating a 5, these five points are because of funny first five seasons, new seasons would probably get a 0 from me.",2015
8,"I found the show to be very funny. The laugh track needs to go though. I was afraid that the girl would be portrayed as a really stereotypical dumb blonde. I was glad to see that she is not. Granted she isn't a nerd genius like the rest of the characters, but she is just your average person. There is a lot of subtle humor mixed in with the obvious jokes. Good show and I hope it lasts as there are very few comedies on Television now that can actually make me laugh.",2007
1,"Is this what comedy for smart people is supposed to be? I found nothing in anything they say that is even even slightly funny. I am a geeky physics student myself, yet, I have nothing in common with any of the characters or the things they say. Many of the jokes, and I use the term 'joke' loosely, may be smart but completely lacking in humour.",2010
6,"At one point, the Big Bang Theory was one of my favourite sitcoms of the past 10 years. The first season I thought was great, with jokes enjoyable without understanding the subject matter, but even better if you did. Though the very caricature like characters (mainly Sheldon) did take a way from the realism, it didn't detract from the show as all I still found enjoyable. The only real problem I had was with Penny. Penny is a character that had little to no personality beyond being the ""hot chick"" and was either obnoxious or boring. She was used mainly to explain things to the audience, which it being a wide appeal sitcom is excusable.",2014
1,What can be said about a supposed comedy where one of the lead characters has to be explained as having a form of autism to explain why he's so offensively annoying? ,2011
4,"""The Big Bang Theory"" started off as a fresh, intelligent and genuinely funny t.v. series that hit its peak during season 3. Every episode had a clear plot that involved one or more of the five central characters that had relevant jokes throughout; as well as many irrelevant to the plot but relevant to the overall theme. ",2014
1,The big bang theory is as much a comedy as Schindler's List.,2013
1,"I am a Yuge fan of this show but there's a distance of heaven & hell between Season 1 & Season 10 of TBBT. This show is currently running through its worst phase. The quality of the show has hit rock bottom. Kaley looks much older than her actual age. Johnny has become fat with soft belly. Jim looks old & his acting became stale. Simon has become less funny. Worst of all is Kunal Nayyar. Man he stinks! His acting stinks. His character was good in 1-5 seasons.And it started deteriorating since then. If anyone were to be fired on the show that would be Kunal. Girl friends/Wives are not funny anymore. This show should have been ended after Season 9. It would have went down in the history as one of the best TV Shows. This show has become as awful as Friends when the show was in its 10th season.Hope Chuck Lorre doesn't kill this show by dragging too long like he did with Two and a Half Men. Jokes don't work.Actors look Old & fat. It is said that this is the last season. Hope he ends well.If not,CBS might even cancel this show. Please don't drag it & end this show after this season. Win-Win for all!",2016
1,"After hearing all my (former) friends rant and rave about this ""smart, edgy, hilarious comedy"" that I just NEEDED to check out, I decided to give this show a try. Note that this is shortly after marathon-ing through some great TV shows like Breaking Bad which is actually a smart show. Anyway, 10 minutes into the first episode I was bored out of my skull with the already repetitive and awkward humour. But, I knew that 10 minutes of one episode was not enough to judge a show by. So I watched the 1st season and a half and I can say not once through those 25 episodes did I even come close to cracking anything that even slightly resembled half a smile. It is the same sitcom show we've seen for the past 40 years disguised as a quirky show filled with intelligent characters. I've read a lot of the other reviews on here and a lot of them agree with the statement that this is not a quirky or even slightly smart show. The demographic it appeals to are brain-dead teenagers who think that when the extremely unfunny Jim Parsons says a few big words, it is the most hilarious thing there has ever been. Strip away the incredibly simple Star Wars references and the mumbled soliloquies of Parsons and what's revealed is a below average sitcom decades behind its time filled with unlikable characters. It baffles me how people can enjoy a single episode of this nonsense, never mind call it a ""masterpiece"". Use the term ""comedy"" very loosely when describing this trash.",2013
1,"I need 10 lines of text so I'll fill it in as if it was from The Big Bang Theory: **laugh** I couldn't get through the first few minute **laugh** without getting ill as the excessively annoying **laugh** laugh track (with the same laugh for the entire show. I know because the moron I lived with played it so loud I could hear it through 2 doors.) **laugh** came on with each and every phrase of each sentence of **laugh** each and every annoying character **laugh** regardless of how ""funny"" it was - **laugh** which of course it wasn't except for the annoying main character **laugh** who had that annoying feminine sarcasm in each and every glib phrase he spewed to try and make it funny - which it wasn't because it was merely annoying. **laugh** 'nuff said.",2015
1,"Last year my friend just couldn't stop talking about how hilarious and funny this was. Even some of my teachers had said good things about it. My friend showed me two episodes on his laptop and said, "" If you don't think this is funny, I don't know what it"". Through the entire hour I laughed as many times as you've spoken while reading this review,zero. It still amazes me that hilarious shows such as Arrested Development get cancelled and this stays on air. For those who say this is "" Smart Comedy"" how is this funny when every funny thing in this show is easy for even the most idiotic people to understand. Than in Arrested Development you can watch episodes over and over again and still find new bits of comedy that you hadn't seen before. Than back to this show where people claim the funniest thing is Sheldon dressed like a zebra making weird noises. What's so smart about that?",2012
10,"I think it has just the right amount of tech humor to stay true to its name, but anybody who's ever worked in an office of any kind should appreciate this show hugely. Big laughs for me every single episode... and I don't ususally laugh outloud. ""Others"" in the house made the comment of me really enjoying myself watching these crazy episodes. I've loved every episode through 5, though to be perfectly honest here and there I found myself wishing for more techie jokes, but i guess they can't chase away the non-techies just yet.",2006
10,"Considering the brain dead material on TV these days, including all the ""reality TV"" garbage, The IT Crowd is probably the best show to come along in a very long time. The characters are well developed, the humour is dry and witty and the cast is amazing. There are so many nuances that you have to pay special attention or you'll miss them, which is difficult to do when you are busting your gut laughing with tears pouring down your face. You have to watch the episodes several times to get it all and each time you howl with anticipation of what you know is coming up next. Favourite parts have to be the tarty red shouza (shoes) and when Roy has to explain to Moss about ""High Tide"" - First scene of Carrie Moss. Richmond is OTT. Brilliant. Can't wait to see series 2.",2007
9,"This time, he's dealing with technology. The IT Crowd, with it's old-skool computer game style opening credits, immediately catches the attention.",2006
9,"The IT Crowd is an absurdist satire of office dramas, featuring those most indispensable of nerds, tech support geeks.",2006
10,"My new all time favorite show. Expertly performed and brilliantly written this is the funniest show I have seen for as long as I can remember. The cast is so perfect, from the nutty Denholm (the boss man) to the eclectic pair of nerds that was the IT department. I am so lucky to have seen an episode on the net, because I would have never seen this on the BBC as I live in the US. You do not have to be a computer nerd to laugh until your sides hurt. However, having any exposure to life inside a company of any modest size will certainly make you appreciate what goes on at this company. Even the elevator, or ""lift"" as the Brits call it is a source of much laughter, as are the bathrooms and many other props. But the real genius of such great writing and comedic delivery on the part of the cast is magnificent. Please continue to make more, and pretty please produce a DVD that I can buy on Amazon.",2007
10,"I never meant to watch The IT Crowd, I stumbled upon it by accident when I was at a friends house and I decided to watch it as there was nothing else on and boy was I glad to have watched it! It was so funny, you must admire the emergency services scene! it was a total shame to have only 6 episodes in the 1 series! I hope series 2 comes out soon because this is by far the best series i have ever watched and will be my all-time favourite TV show ever! Moss is a great character and definitely suits the program well as his witty funny lines fits everywhere they are mentioned! ""If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them."" Class ;) The IT Crowd is A perfect 10/10 a must see.",2006
10,"This series is so good. The cast is wonderful and it made me laugh and cackle in a way that I haven't too often. Really good stuff. I love the reality of all of the wires and all of the keyboards around... etc. The mess of the place/office is heartwarming - and the randomness of the ""relationship manager"" is really funny. The show has a 70's look to it - It kind of looks like my old shows growing up, like the Jeffersons - so it has this feel to it like there is some kind of art going on.",2007
10,"This is truly a comedy of pure genius. All the elements involved are spot on, and combine to make a show of pure brilliance. Brilliant scripts, wonderfully acted, the mix of Chris O'Dowd, Richard Ayoade and Katherine Parkinson combine outrageously well. Huge credit to Graham Linehan too, previously successful with Father Ted and Black Books his pedigree is there for all to see. ",2015
10,"this show is like the British version of seinfeld for the it lovers, extremely intelligent, well written and most importantly well acted. The actor who stands out is def Richard Ayoade, explosive performance. Although 10 stars, i think people ages 17-40 might like the show better, than older or younger crowds, because of the intelligence of comedic tones, and also the it parts. The first episode, might be hard to understand for Americans, because of the British English vs American English, but by video two, it takes you to it's world. Work place, co- workers. overall, this show hits between left and right in comedy, between two intelligent guys, and a co-worker, with barely any It knowledge who's an idiot at IT but brilliant at people, and IT guys, that are brilliant at IT but idiots with people. I love the automated phone message, to shut off and restart the computer, is a classic. Hilarious.",2015
9,"If you wanna laugh out loud, watch The IT Crowd. It's one of my favorite TV Shows that I've enjoyed most watching. It's about two nerd that work as IT in a large corporation. They're surrounded with dumb people, and that's what makes it funny. A new department chief comes. A girl that has no idea with computers.",2015
9,"For those who complain that ""The Big Bang Theory"" is too artificial and panders to mainstream audiences, there's a fantastic option for getting your geek/comedy fix in the U.K.'s ""The IT Crowd"". The sitcom, from writer/director Graham Linehan, is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. In my opinion, sitcoms have always been a cheap form of laughs that cater to the lowest common denominator with themes reused over and over again for the same gags. But this one felt genuine and original with a fun twist on common life foibles as seen through the eyes of two antisocial computer techs toiling away in the basement of a major corporation. We introduced to their world in the beginning with the arrival of Jen Barber (Katherine Parkinson) when she's hired as the manager of Reynholm Industries' IT department. A computer- illiterate woman intent on faking her way to success, she meets Roy Trenneman (Chris O'Dowd) and Maurice Moss (Richard Ayoade): the company's crack IT team. Over the course of four series (and a total of 25 episodes), the three of them will endure everything from cannibalism to viral menstruation as they attempt to break out of their sheltered world and, you know, do things grown adults are supposed to do. The show has a fun balance of humor that will appeal to the more geek-centric viewers while keeping most of it broad enough that anyone can find something hilarious. This show is everything I'm pretty sure ""The Big Bang Theory"" wanted to be.",2014
10,"I first saw The IT Crowd after a friend recommended the show to me, and I'm glad I watched it. I was hooked onto the show right after the first episode, and each episode kept getting funnier. The IT Crowd is definitely one of the funniest comedies I have seen in a long time. I have even recommended it to friends and family and they have found themselves hooked.",2015
10,"The IT Crowd is brilliant thanks to not only Graham Linehan's clever writing, (he also wrote the Irish classic Father Ted), but also because the actors have such a great chemistry. Absurd scenarios and quirky, over the top characters are the signatures of this show. Chris O'Dowd has become a Hollywood star, but Richard Ayoade, Katherine Parkinson and Matt Berry are equally talented. Having them all together in one show is really a treat. I'm so glad they came back for a final episode to give the series closure. If you are fond of British humor, or you work in IT support, you should definitely give this show a try. In my opinion, it is in the top ten, (or even the top five), shows of all time.",2014
10,"Each episode well written, performances by Katharine Parkinson (Jen), Chris O'Dowd (Roy), and Richard Ayoade (Moss) are all extremely well executed; makes one want to find more of what they all have to offer. It is unfortunate that British comedies only have 6 episodes per series, I suppose it's quality over quantity. If you are hesitant on watching this show please don't be and please do so now. I am really not much of a TV critique (this being my first review) but this is one show I find to be extremely well thought out and deserving of the credit it needs. f you like comedy and have not seen this, the you are really missing something great.",2014
9,"The show's got a few episodes that bring side plots together for a 'grande finale'-esque bit, which is a very difficult style to pull off, especially for 22 minute episodes. The majority of the show is that awkward humor we geeks know and love so much. This show reminds me an awful lot of the cartoon series ""Clerks"" but with a more grown up feel. There are, as with any series, a few episodes that go so far over the top you groan from pain, but the chances of a deliciously laid out bit is well worth the endurance. ",2015
8,"This is more then nerdy, it is great and nerdy, funny and strange, weird and wonderful. It has very nerdy characters their in each their own personal way is strange and wonderful at the same time.",2015
9,"I'm writing this, assuming that people already know about the 1st series.",2008
10,This show is brilliant!! As they would say in the UK. The cast is a quirky ensemble whose chemistry never stops igniting. If you want to check out complete and utter comedy watch the episode where Jen goes to the theater with a man who she thinks is gay. The schematics that Roy and Moss get into will make to you laugh until your stomach hurts. I have heard that they are making an American version of this show...and I've seen the cast right here on IMDb and it pains me to say it. The American cast appear to be a clich√© and too cute to work in IT. That is one of the things I love about the show is Jen's natural beauty. Her individuality is what makes that character special. When you throw a 100 pound blonde hair blue eyed actress in my screen and start calling her Jen it just doesn't work.,2009
10,"After stumbling onto this show, on the More4 channel in Ireland, I was instantly hooked! Very clever tongue-in-cheek humor, along with all-out wit and banter--it is a must-see. Moss, Jen, Roy (and later Richmond) are a great ensemble, each lending their own unique humor to each scene and easily playing off each other. Life in 'middle earth'(as the IT department is referred to in one episode)is a great concept,the clich√©d idea of 'computer geeks' taken to a new level. With Jen leading the department, and knowing nothing about computers, it is up to Moss and Roy to answer the very few phone calls from the corporates upstairs(to which the immediate response is: ""did you try turning it on?"") then fix the usually minor computer problems. Later discovery of the once junior CEO-turned-goth hiding behind the red door(Richmond), adds an extra element of fun and a clever twist of someone being a nerd and a goth at the same time. I hope this is on for many more seasons...it's a fantastic show!!!",2008
10,"Let me start out by saying I wasn't sure about this show after watching the first episode. As the show progressed it became my favorite show very quickly. In fact after the second season I planned a trip to London just to watch the filming of the show but we didn't get tickets. I'm an American from Chicago and cannot pick another comedy that makes me feel better than the IT Crowd. Simply amazing is all I can say. This is the type of show you can watch a hundred times because it is easy to like, and lets you forget about the stresses of everyday life when you watch it. Each line from Roy or Moss is an instant classic. If you claim you don't like this show then you don't understand this type of comedy. I simply cannot say enough about how funny Roy and Moss are. If you have worked anywhere around the IT field you can truly enjoy the humor these two bring to the screen. It's hard to describe the feeling you get when watching this sitcom. It really does take you to another place where you can just sit back and laugh the night away - all stresses in life are gone. Douglas is over the top but a true gem on the screen. I could go on and on but do yourself a huge favor and embrace this show. Make sure you keep up the pressure for a 5th and 6th season because the story has not been fully told yet.",2011

10,I had my doubts. I knew that Pixar would fail this time around. No way were they going to pull this off for a seventh time.,2006

A Truly Moving Picture ""¬Öexplores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.",2006
9,"I thought the story looked very lame from previews, and the concept didn't appeal to me. But when I saw an early screening I was surprised, it was well written and well executed. They didn't overload the movie with automotive jokes, which I think would have hurt the story and character development. Owen Wilson's voice is great for his role. Overall, it's on par with other Pixar films, even if it may not be their best so far. The animation is superb, definitely the best they've done. Giving something like cars distinct personality and characterization seems like it would be pretty tough, and they do a great job with it. See this movie the day it opens.",2006

9,"I went to the premier of ""Cars"" last night at the Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concorde and was delighted to find that the hours of traffic were worth it. ",2006
8,"Without giving away any of the story, here's my take. I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the ""original"", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the ""Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies"" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.",2006
5,"As Pixar, Blue Sky and DreamWorks continue to tick off the list of cute cuddly animals to make films about, director John Lasseter and Joe Ranft (the latter sadly and ironically died in a car crash last year) brings us a story about cars in incongruous human setting. Nine years of hard work in combining Lasseter's two great interests, cars and animation, finally gives us a satisfying end product but regrettably 'Cars' is just that. Satisfactory and utterly charmless.",2006
6,"when Pixar announced their idea for ""Cars"" (a world exactly like our own but inhabited by living cars instead of humans), I thought that the film was going to be an instant failure. Then, as the images of the new graphics and the plot outlines started to came out I was still unimpressed by them, seeing at how unoriginal the plot was and how everything seemed to be aiming for showing off their technical progress, my hopes for ""Cars"" were really low. I guess that's why I ended up liking it so much.",2006
9,"I was able to attend a premiere showing of this movie in North Carolina and was amazed again at how much more a movie can be than just ""animation."" This film focuses on a changed reality, a world where cars are the only life form and so we must suspend our own reality to enjoy this film. In the same flavor as the first Pixar films, we quickly accept a world where everything is a motorized vehicle that lives and acts like we do in our own world. The cars have experiences in life, desires that drive (sorry for that) them, and misunderstandings that are taken advantage of.",2006
9,"Caught the world premiere at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte-- we're not race fans ourselves by any means, but you really don't have to be to get on the road with this one. We were privvy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backroad to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun. Not only on the fact that he's a tow truck, but also his ""they call me tater salad"" bit-- Overall, highly entertaining, just try not to speed too much on the way home....",2006
9,"People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. ",2013
8,"Pixar just keeps hitting them out of the park. Larry the cable guy was a great cast as Mater. Owen Wilson as Lightining was another great decision for the makers of Cars. There is never a dull moment while watching this film. I guess that is obvious by the overwhelming success at the box office. Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids.

8,"Animated films are not my favorite genre and I am not a Nascar fan. I anticipated that I would reflect on the 2 hours in a movie theater as quality family time rather than quality entertainment but this movie had me hooked from the beginning. My kids did not have my background to understand Route 66 history but they didn't need it. The loved the film for other reasons. I lived in small towns where a day is fueled with hope of what might come over the horizon. I have actually been cow tipping and laughed at the tractor scenes. I really appreciate the part of the theme of a successful member of a younger generation listening to and profiting by the wisdom of someone older. Far too many children's shows revolve around a plot with stupid adults and the youth needing to save the world. This film perhaps restored, for me, a little faith in our entertainment industry. This is one movie the whole family really can enjoy. See this movie if for no other reason than to support the production of this type of message.",2006

10,"I just got home from an early screening of Cars. I got to see it in a digital cinema, and it really brought out the beauty of this Pixar gem. It seems that with every Pixar movie they aim to tackle a new piece of animation. With Nemo it was water, Monsters Inc. was fur. Cars has some amazing effects as far as the lighting and reflections. The cars in the movie feel very real, because of the fantastic lighting work. Also, it seems there are a lot more landscape scenes which are done very, very nicely.",2006

6,"I honestly don't get, why there are so many positive comments on this movie. As you can expect from a ""pixar"" movie, the animation quality is really awesome. But in my opinion, that's about it. The story is really boring and the comical scenes are just mediocre as well. Has anyone noticed that, besides the fact that the story doesn't surprise the viewer even once, it's pretty much the same as in ""surf's up""? A young talented guy enters a challenge, meets his old hero (who has stopped doing what he was once the best at, for a tragic reason), doesn't recognize him at first, then gets him to give some advice, and finally is the winner of the hearts, although not actually winning the challenge. And while doing all that, he wins a girl over, that didn't like him before, and gets his hero to appear before the public again.",2009
4,"Yeah the graphics are great, but that is all because of the computer animation techniques today (consider how much money they keep putting into these CG's). The story line is old style and dragging, one can easily predict what will happen. I think this movie is overrated, maybe because of all the car-lovers in the U.S. The plot is just OK, the effort to portrait characters (both the main and supporting ones) is weak. Anyway, worth to go with kids to see all the colors and spend some family time. But if you are looking for something exciting, youmight be disappointed.",2007
9,"The plot of this movie is a lot like Doc Hollywood starring Michael J. Fox. A ""Big City"" hotshot on his way to LA finds himself stuck in a small hick town and endures a miserable week of volunteer work all the while falling in love with the town's comfortable feeling and quirky but genuine inhabitants. How can anyone not love this film? From the hilarious and laid back Owen Wilson to the gritty and serious Paul Newman, this film is full of strong characters including the smaller roles (Michael Keaton!). It's funny, charming and heartfelt and full of great tunes as well. Just the opening sequence alone will have you tapping your feet to Sheryl Crow and the end may bring tears when you hear Brad Paisley. My husband and i are in our 30s and we adore this film.

Claire cuts herself with a knife. Claire jumps off a building. Claire's dad appears to be good. Claire's dad appears to be bad. Hiro jumps in the air with his hands up and yells ""We did it!"", Peter's hair is in his eyes, Nikki is wimpy, Nikki is kicking butt, A character has a new power, Adam is doing something jerky, etc. Now put the poker chips in a bag, shake them, and lay 10 of them out on the table.

7,"Heroes is one of the most controversial shows of the decade, but not for the reasons you may think. When Heroes premiered, it was one of the most popular shows on television. Fanboys were created around the world, but disaster struck: Heroes, for reasons unknown, started to suck after a wonderful first volume. Fanboys were in denial everywhere: Was their precious Heroes really going down the drain, or was it just a hiccup? People expected old Heroes to come back when volume three came to us, and.... Heroes was awful. People stopped watching, but as they stopped, the old Heroes we loved slowly came back in volume four. Now the show is in volume five, and did the show returned to form? Read on...",2009
1,"It's impossible for me to find a rating that reflects the overall quality of the show. It started out strong; the first season was far from perfect, but it had an energy and a message that simply felt good. There were incredibly fulfilling episodes, such as Homecoming, Company Man, Five Years Gone, and heart-warming character moments not just for a few, but for most characters. I felt safe with this show. Anyway, one of the show's biggest problems became obvious in th finale, when all the character came together for a mostly underwhelming showdown. Somehow, Heroes was best when it did not follow closely to a plan, but allowed its characters some room to develop naturally. The best moments and characters of Season 1 are thanks to the writers having enough sense to use the opportunities that opened up. When Noah Bennet proved a more interesting character than previously hoped for, his role became bigger. The same for Sylar. The enmity between Mohinder and Sylar. Molly. It all grew naturally, and lost its momentum only when everything was yanked back into the intended showdown.",2009

9,I first saw the teaser commercial for Heroes at the end of Medium's last season and started salivating. And now that I've tuned in I'm hooked. The premise of super-humans has been done before and most recently in Mutant X. And I've been around to check these shows out. The misfit one with Courtney Cox was an old favorite. But none of these shows garnished the pure mystery that Heroes had going for it all the way to the end of the pilot. Plus a killer cast should make it a surefire hit.,2006

9,"I just watched this today (recorded it from last night) and quite honestly, I'm pleasantly surprised. I was convinced the hype machine would kill this show, building up expectations so high they could never be met, but Heroes has measured up nicely, hitting on all marks in my book. I'm as a huge a 24 and House fan as is out there, but Heroes may have just taken TV's top billing in one night.",2006
3,"When I first heard about heroes I liked the idea very much.

9,"Heroes, in this writers opinion, is probably the most compelling pilot I've seen this year. Yeah there's ""traveler"" ""Jericho"" ""Kidnapped""... they were good, but nothing that wasn't predictable. I must give credit to ""Tim Kring"" the creator of this series much credit for not treating the viewers like idiots. Superhero TV shows always have tendency to be wannabee big-budget Jr. movies. ""Heroes"" will have none of that! From reading the outline one would an expect ""X-men"" rip-off. Such is not the case for ""Heroes."" It is completely original in it's presentation. It would be a crime for me to give away plot details. I just hope the rest of the series continues to be this smart.By the way, it's nice to see ""Ali Larter"" given a provocative role like the the one she plays in this series, that's demonstrates her range as an actress. Kudos to all involved! Now only if NBC gives this darn show a friggin' chance!",2006
3,"not much of a spoiler in this post. i wouldn't worry about it, but it's there for safety's sake. i guess the disappointing thing about heroes is that, judging from the pilot alone, the writers at the helm don't seem to have the finesse to fulfill the premise's potential. it's a difficult thing to balance - an interwoven group of characters who all develop superpowers - a fact made evident by the pilot. the ""catch"" for each of the characters is okay, but is substantially weakened by the writer's desire to shove them into new york by the end of the episode. there's really not much of a cohesive concept, and so much of the dialogue is self-important and blatantly expository, it's more of a distraction than an addition. this film could potentially benefit from a better group of writers. and, quite frankly, while i appreciate the attempt to set up the lives and moods of the characters, poorly executed homogeneous direction, coupled with the pitfalls of the initial premise provide the viewer with little more than a forced and crypto-pedantic show. this is thus far a squandered opportunity. we look forward to bigger and better things on the horizon, for other shows, as well as this show.",2006

There are so many other fails, but I do not want to waste space (especially about controls the time/space continuum)...",2010
9,"Although the show's concept is sort of a ripoff of the X-Men concept of people evolving to have super powers, I have to admit it was enjoyable. The acting was all very well done as were the slices of life that introduced you to each character. The effects are kept very low-key making it more believable than the typical super hero show. There is a great underlying darkness that permeates as well, giving one the feeling that some very bad things are about to happen. My mom even liked it, and she usually just sticks to shows about cops and politics (like West Wing, Law & Order, and CSI). If you haven't seen it give it a try. It's a very good show so far and only promises to get better.",2006
5,Many Spoilers be aware,2007
1,"This must by far be the worst butchering of a TV series ever. It is almost impressive how they totally trash a tremendous show along the way until only a burning wreck remains. The writers responsible should quit their jobs and live in shame for the rest of their lives. This is a painful display of inconsistency and incompetent writing. I was actually excited when I heard about ""heroes reborn"" but now that I have just finished s4 I am not so sure anymore. Maybe I will watch it out of pure curiosity and I am telling myself that it can not get any worse. This show desperately needs Hiro to go back to the start of s2 and bitchslap everyone around the writingtable.",2015
3,"I was unimpressed with the first few episodes of this program; the characters were a clich√©d cross section of society, and the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer narration detracted from any mystery the show would otherwise have created. However, as the series goes on, the story becomes complex and intricate enough that it draws you in. The problem is that for a show like this to be really great, it has to let you suspend your disbelief. This one insists on making that impossible. The writers are perpetually trying to provide ""scientific"" explanations for what's happening; these really aren't necessary to the plot, and they are based on such fundamentally flawed understandings of evolution and human physiology that they make me want to throw my shoe at the TV and curse our educational system. The writers also can't seem to decide if they want to deify evolution or bring God into the picture, and the corny narration tries and fails to make the whole thing seem more profound. Add to all this the way the characters constantly swing back and forth between protagonist and antagonist without ever really developing, and the show takes on kind of a Jackson Pollock feel--a jumbled mess of story lines that is kind of fun to unravel, but in the end, doesn't mean much. Also, call me overcritical, but I really can't get over details like the fact that Claire, the cheerleader with rapid regeneration, has pierced ears. Come on. I grit my teeth and roll my eyes at this show, but it's hard to stop watching because you want to know how it ends.",2009

2,"Seriously, I don't know who wrote the screenplay. The show started without relevant expository, and the worst of all was the Japanese guy. He was introduced in the first scene as a normal geek and BAM, he controls the time/space continuum(repeated 1,039 times). I mean, if that is not convenient scripting, I don't know what is. The characters are all unbelievable. Is like they live their lives as normal people and BAM, hey you know what, I think I can fly/bend time/read your mind/paint the future/blah blah. After all the hype, I don't know what people sees in the show. The editing sucks, the dialogue corny, the direction confusing and worst of all, it pretty much like a stylized but dumb-down version of X-men! I'm no fan of series, and if this is what they have to offer, I will keep my staple of Simpsons and Seinfeld reruns.",2006
10,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",2006
1,"what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull",2007
5,"Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.",2006

It was total copy cat of the Infernal Affairs. When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, ""Sorry, I'm a police officer."" Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it's a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn't know how to act. They should of had Brad Pitt instead. The performance would be more outstanding. They got lots of cheap actors for The Departed. For the Infernal Affairs, they got a lot of expensive actors.

1,"The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.",2007

I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).",2006

When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.",2006

I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in.

The entire script was centered around who could use the F word the most in one sentence. I believe that the writer must believe that in order to be a ""real"" man that you have to curse. The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a ""real"" man. Don't try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do. I am a police officer and have been for over 35 years and have never heard anyone use the f word like it was used in this movie.

Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that.

Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. ",2006

Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see.

With her, we travel beyond outward appearances, through a labyrinth of fears and uncertainties, from which Spain will not escape for several decades.",2006
10,"I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi L√≥pez, Maribel Verd√∫ and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro.",2006
9,I saw this at this years FrightFest Film Festival in London and absolutely loved it.,2006
10,"It is Guillermo del Toro's best film ( 22 minutes ovation at Cannes). Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from all involved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist army captain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) as the Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find is Ivana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives one of the best performances from a child actor we have seen since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Come to it unprepared and with your mind wide open and you will be rewarded with one of the best films of the year.""",2006
9,"I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.",2006
7,First lets start with the 20 minute standing ovation this film supposedly got at Cannes. After watching the film I don't believe it. Someone must have exaggerated the length of time by at least 18 minutes. That or those apparently ecstatic people were drunk. Don't get me wrong this is a good film. But the praise this is getting from critics and people writing here is way over the top. I was fully expecting a work of real vision and/or originality but what I experienced was a film that borrows from other films and admittedly gels everything together into a cohesive and impressive whole. A lot of great films do the same but 'Pans Labrynth' has other faults that prevent it from being put in the same category as the truly great films. ,2007
6,"When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.",2007
5,"This fairy tale with parallels to ""Alice in Wonderland"" has a little girl encountering bizarre characters in an alternate universe. The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However, the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are one-dimensional. The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents, but the two threads don't complement each other. It's like watching two movies. del Toro's obsession with stomach-churning violence doesn't help matters.",2010
6,"After reading all the positive reviews and being a great fan of Maribel Verdu (since her role in ""Amantes""), I had great expectations before seeing this movie. Quite honestly, I was disappointed. The characters lack depth. All falangistas are incredibly bad and sadistic, and all nationalists republicans are good in this movie. Stereotypic. If Del Toro wanted to make Capitan Vidal really terrifying, he would have made a little bit more sympathetic at times, like ""Landa"" in Inglourious Basterds - probably the most terrifying nazi ever on the silver screen. Vidal could at least have been a little bit concerned for his wife when she was bearing his unborn son. But now, he is a facha macho, so he can not show emotions at any time. Even the symbolism of the labyrinth is too easy : especially the end, where the self sacrifice of Ofelia is a clear sign of a Messias, including the invitation to sit at the right hand of her father in a sort of a pagan Trinity (with her mother). The cinematography however is wonderful and the actor perform well, but the scenario is just too shallow for my taste.",2010
4,"A fairy flies around the face of an enthralled, fairy-loving girl for the first time, and she just looks straight ahead, smiling vaguely. Giant black bugs crawl up her arms and she ignores them. A terrible monster sits quietly at a food-laden dining table but ehhhh she's hungry so no need to even keep an eye on it. BUT OH when a thing hits a guy hard in the face yes of course the face breaks and blood squishes through the ruptures and his dad cries out in anguish and tries to reach for him and then the guy gets a bullet and more blood squirts out and then the dad gets shot too and more blood squirts out. Etc. etc. for two hours. The message: Fantasy is irrelevant; guns are reality.",2010
7,"I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too.",2007
6,"I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.",2007
5,"I can't add anymore really, than some of the more realistic non-rose colored glasses-wearing voters/reviewers that I have read so far, have stated about this over-hyped, coffeehouse-artsy, brain drain of a movie.",2009

2,"I seem to be among the only people who consider this movie to be a terrible mis-fire, on a par with Shyamalan's *Lady in the Water* and Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"".",2007
3,"It is really interesting that a movie so enjoyed by some viewers can be so annoying for others. This is my general impression when I read reviews on IMDb. Pan's Labyrinth (PL) is the most typical example when it's completely incomprehensible for me how a movie can be so highly rated. The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK, for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of story-telling technique, but the story is so unpleasant, one-dimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema (which almost never happens).",2007

8,"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. ",2006
10,"The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.",2009
8,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.",2006
10,"I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. ",2006
10,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?",2006
9,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.",2006
9,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.",2006
10,"I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen this year, i was not expecting it to be that good. There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.",2006
10,"The Prestige. I am impressed. I am a HUGE fan of Hugh Jackman and bought the book as soon as I heard he would be in this movie. I read it and enjoyed it, but wasn't especially fond of it. But I still had been really looking forward to this movie.",2006
10,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.

10,This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.,2006
4,"I'd been excited about seeing THE PRESTIGE, especially as it re-teamed two of my favourite film people from BATMAN BEGINS: the usually excellent Christopher Nolan, who delivered the excellent INSOMNIA and MEMENTO, and Christian Bale, an actor who can do no wrong in my eyes. Then what a shame it is that THE PRESTIGE turns out to be nothing more than a silly, muddled science fiction film masquerading as a serious and engaging drama.",2016
4,"I don't know how any movie buff would not see the twists coming from a mile away. One can see when a twist is done in a tasteful and careful manner, and when the film makers are desperately trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Credit must be given to Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and David Bowie for their superb acting. However Christian Bale(who I normally like) and Scarlett Johansson were terrible. A few of my specific gripes: 1. The ending is given away in the first minute. Christian Bale is accused of killing Hugh Jackman. EVERY MOVIE that starts with this presentation ends up with the supposedly accused being innocent.",2013
3,"Reading these drooling reviews, I have to wonder what has gone wrong with the movie-viewing community of late.",2006
5,Sometimes I think movies are losing their magic. Over the years I have learned so much about the movie making process -- about how stunts and special effects are done -- that movies just don't amaze me quite as much any more. It takes a movie made with remarkable skill to make me forget the process that goes on behind the scenes to make the movie magic believable.,2006
5,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",2009

2,"This film really annoyed the hell out of me. It is definitely an entry into the oeuvre of movies that are so obsessed by how clever its twists are that it forgets to worry about things such as sympathetic characterisation, naturalistic expositional dialogue, and, most crucially, the effective execution of said oh-so-clever twists.",2006
2,"A true mystery cannot include supernatural action or agents unknown to science, nor any physical impossibilities (or even improbabilities).",2007
4,"...but it fell like a card-house. I really like the thought of the ""its all about the sacrifices you make"" plot but it just doesn't last. Up until Nikola Tesla did his cloning/teleport thingey I still had some hopes for the movie and I sat hoping that Tesla had faked the cloning just to get some more money when i saw the hats and cats on the ground. I genuinely hoped the filmmakers illustrated Tesla as a hoax, it sure seemed better than the movie getting all Star Trek! Unfortenately the writers didn't pick up that extra ace from their sleeves and the movie literally flat-lined and just died. ",2007
4,"Sorry, but I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a ""how to write a short story"" article. The thrust of the piece was -- if you get bored or can't figure out an ending, have your character get hit by a bus. This movie seems to take that approach.",2007
5,"This movie had the potential to be excellent. Great setting, great acting, great potential for a twist. However, though this might have been easier to hide in the book, the ""twist"" was too easily foreseen. The first glance at Fallon, and I said ""hey that looks like Christian Bale,"" but wrote it off as coincidence. However the second time we caught a glimpse of this mysterious character, I figured out the ""mystery"". An undeveloped character with a beard, lowered hat, and obviously disguised? Hmm. I could tell his eyes were Christian Bale's from the start. And as the movie dragged on, with this character speaking no lines, it only proved the obvious. Fallon is Borden's ""double"" (twin) with makeup and fake facial hair. He is too underdeveloped, mysterious, and quiet to be anything else. And he just plain looks like Christian Bale! (minus the fatter cheeks from the prosthetic.) The clues stacked up too high throughout. How certain lines to Fallon were worded. His role in the family. The altering personalities of Borden. There was no surprise when Fallon took of the mask and shot his rival. So much for the crazy twist.",2016

The writing is quick, intelligent and witty plus the acting is fast-paced and done in an almost believable way even though the premise would be considered far-fetched by some. The storyline does cause the watcher to look at the clues that are given and try to figure out who did what and to whom. James Roday is perfect for the part that he plays, bringing to the part some of the comic timing and zaniness that he showed in 'Repli-Kate', one of his earlier movies. This series shows that he has refined his craft since then. I hope that this series is given the respect and audience that it deserves",2006

The supporting cast at the police station was adequate with the chief really shining compared to the two detectives having an affair.",2006
10,"Psych truly is a show for everyone. It's use of sarcasm and witty repartee is hilarious which obviously shows that USA Network knows how to define characters. I love the fact that they rely more on character performance rather than the solving of the crime, because it allows you to know the character and relate to him or her. Knowing a character really gets you involved in their life, whether it be your best friend, or someone on television Friday nights. If you want to fall out of your seat laughing, this show is definitely for you. Next weeks episode ""Spellingg Bee"" looks more promising than the premiere, if that's even a possibility. All else we can really do is welcome Psych, because it's obviously here to stay!",2006

James Roday and Dule Hill are well-cast as best friends and hesitant investigation partners, and it is fun to see Corbin Bernsen in the role of gruff and demanding father - in stark contrast to his early ""pretty-boy"" work on L.A. Law. Very well written, with a fast-pace through the story and humor throughout, it is smart enough to keep you thinking and accessible (and appropriate) enough for younger family members. PSYCH has become our new ""must-TiVo"" show because it draws the entire family - middle school, high school, and parents - to the TV.",2006

A lot are saying that its like Monk, but I honestly don't see any real similarities, the story lines are completely different, and Psych adds a new kind of humor which I found hilarious. The only real likeness is that they are both detective shows. The main characters work very well together, and there was enough going on to make me want to keep watching, without being overwhelmed. The man playing Shawn Spencer (whose name I forgot) I thought was great and adorable, and I'm looking forward to watching him every week. I think it is a perfect companion show for Monk, a show I admire also. I gave it a 9 out of 10.",2006
7,"Psych is one of the most interesting and comedic series to come out this year. After watching the pilot episodes with one of my friends we were both hooked. James Roday brings his character, Shawn Spencer, a laid back cynical sleuth to life. The witty dialogue is enough to keep anyone entertained for the duration of every episode so far. The character of Gus played by Dule Hill is a brilliant contrast to Raday's character, creating excellent chemistry showcasing how opposites make great television. Over all Psych is a clever, interesting, and hilarious show. Although its not completely original and some concepts are a little far fetched, I think it will entertain anyone who takes the time to tune in Friday evenings.",2006
10,"This is such terrific show. I had DVRd it and was waiting for a chance to watch the last 2 episodes with my husband. Well, I got sick of waiting and I am so happy that I have these episodes to watch. It is smart, funny and interesting to watch. I love Dule Hill anyway--he is the main reason I gave this show a chance--and he plays his character very well. The supporting cast is very good. I liked Timothy Omundson on ""Judging Amy"" and it is disconcerting to see him as a not-so-nice guy, but his character has a few redeeming qualities. Corbin Bernson is difficult to watch because his character seems so mean, but he puts just the right touch on his character to keep him from being too hateful.",2006

""Gus"" doesn't always agree with ""Shawn"" which always leads to ""Shawn"" motivating him into helping him! Corbin Bensen also is terrific as the father who is strict but actually is very proud of his son! The way Shawn and Gus solve these cases is a must see! Shawn is an intelligent and very observant man and Gus also intelligent has a large knowledge about medicine who is a great help to Shawn in many ways! It is also very funny to see how Shawn always manages to convince people he is a psychic! But we and his father know he isn't,but he is clearly very observant and very good in deducting like Sherlock Holmes! The show is fast paced and exciting! Great show!",2007

There are tons of guest stars that you might see that you recognize from other places and the supporting cast are also terrific . The flashbacks that take place at the beginning of the show allows us to see how a young Shawn because who is is now. There is really no reason he is not a cop and choose to lie about being a physic. He just likes taking the easy way out and always quit his previous jobs. Check the show out! Hopefully, you'll enjoy it as I do.",2007
10,I loved this show so much u am practically begging them to create at lest one more episode this was literally the best show ever created I have watched the season over and over again I would give it 1000000000 out of 10. So I really think the should create at least one more episode it was the best show in the world next to Doctor who. I normal don't like a show this much but come one it was the best show every created the creator was one of the best show producers ever to be alive and who else agrees that they should create another episode or even season of psych I do. I like that at the end they got married and the man stole the ring that cracked me up and it never gets old none of the episodes get old I think I am speaking for everyone when I say create another season or at least episode.,2016
9,"This series is not only one of the most entertaining, but also one of the most interesting series I've been watching.",2014
10,"After missing most of the first season and catching up on re-runs throughout the summer and watching the second season religiously. This show is witty, with the lead character Shawn providing the comical and enjoyable bantering with his partner, co-lead Gus. The show provides a new life into the all to common police shows that litter television. His keen ""psychic"" abilities help allow the audience to try and figure out what is going on moments before he reveals the answers.",2008
9,"So far, the only disappointment I've felt towards this show is that it isn't recognized for its almost constant, sometimes totally random, comedy. James Roday (Shawn Spencer) and Dule Hill (Gus) have so much chemistry that their comedy comes out almost flawlessly, creating an incredible combination of hilarious scenes, crimes that are new and never boring, and ""secondary"" characters that only add to the hilarity. You would think that with all of the secondary characters (Carlton Lassiter, Henry Spencer, Juliet, etc.) that some of them would at times seem out of place, but except for the occasional instances of random Corbin Bernsen sightings (Henry Spencer), there aren't many forced character instances. Even the police chief has her place and in this second season, her scenes have started getting funnier. Also in this new season, we see Gus starting to play along with Shawn's insane psychic ramblings. Such a great show. I just hope that more people recognize it even though it's not on a major network.",2007
9,"This show is amazing. It's funny, it's well acted, it's well written... it's just brilliant! I stumbled on this show by chance... I was buying the season 5 box-set of Monk (another brilliant show) and for a few dollars extra I got season one of Psych included. I wasn't sure what to expect, to be honest I had never even heard of the show before then, but I did like the premise right off the bat. I'm so sick and tired of wasted time slots taken up by shows like Medium and Ghost Whisperer so when I realized that this show was an off the wall take of those shows I fell in love immediately.",2007
4,"I really wanted to like this show. I really did. But it just wasn't that great for me. I loved the idea. It was like a mix of Dexter (Where the super-cop dad taught the kid everything), Lie To Me (He notices the littlest things and can put a puzzle together quickly) and Suits (where he has a very photographic memory). I love all those shows. But this just didn't keep my interest.",2014
10,"Very funny. I was getting tired of the family and hospital sitcoms, Psych is so different and so mad. Both the guys are adorable. I love the character of Henry (Shawn'a dad), his dry humour is a perfect contrast to Shawn's over the top craziness and Gus's disapproving,confused act. Yes Lassy gets a little tiring after a few episodes, initially his stand was funny, he could get a little more vicious. Juliet is a darling but is getting dull. And how long is the Chief going to be pregnant. Though none of this matters as Shawn and Gus are what I am hooked to. James Roday is awesome, I maybe mistaken but he looks very familiar, though i cannot recall which show I saw him on or maybe he is just so good that he looks like he has been around for a while. The only sad thing is we, in India, get to watch it a season late. Really hope it stays on air, unlike 'Wonderfalls', another show that was quirky and crazy but went off production.",2007
10,This has become my favorite show on TV. Roday and Hill are excellent together. My favorite episodes so far are the BEE epi and the Little boy Cat epi. The show is well written and extremely well acted. Rarely can I watch an episode more than once and still enjoy it. I have watched every episode more than three times and still laugh every time. I think this show should last a very long time. I would love to see Shawn and Monk in an episode together. Could you imagine the chaos? I certainly can imagine the laughter that would ensue. I would love to see Shawn and Gus go to San Francisco and tangle with Monk. I would to see more of Corbin and where are Gus' parents. I would like to see more of a back story on him as well. Please USA keep the episodes and seasons coming. I can't get enough!!!!!!!!!,2007
10,Psych is currently the best show on television. It deserves to win an Emmy award for Best Comedy. Two and a Half Men is the number one comedy in the US but this was NOT its best year. This year Psych was funnier.,2007

10,"Dexter will never disappoint. Each and every episode is a work of art, and it never gets boring or old. To start, we have excellent deliveries from Michael C. Hall as the serial killer (yet a like-able one) known as Dexter Morgan. Add ""The Excorcism Of Emily Rose"" star Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Dexter's sometimes moody sister, Deb.",2006
10,"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!",2006
10,"I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.",2006
10,"Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books.",2006
10,"Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clich√©s.",2006
7,"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.",2006
10,"HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale + Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up.",2006
10,"Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt.",2006
10,"Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.",2006
9,"After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z.

His does it so well, it completely let you forget that he played the role of David in Six Feet Under (my favorite of all time-series!). And all the characters in the five seasons are really wonderful, but I especially liked Julia Stiles. She's playing her part very nice!! Lithgow in season 4 does his part only as he can do and it works fine for me! Can't wait 'till he returns! (he must return!!) Here in Holland ""Dexter"" airs on a non-commercial canal en mostly about 23.00 h. at night. Nobody in Holland heard of this series, unless they watch in online or on DVD. And that's a pity...

5,"Having watched Dexter right to the bitter end I have to say I won't miss it at all. What was a better than average series, stylishly directed with a great cast was forgiven for being a bit repetitive. It should have ended 3 seasons ago, this last season was pathetic, it was as though the writers had been sacked, some new ones brought in and told to keep it ""ticking over"" and told to end it all in the last 2 episodes. for a show built on secrets very few were revealed, this went out with a pathetic whimper. The penultimate series built to a real dramatic high that promised so much for the final series, instead of keeping this up and pushing the characters to new extremes it was as if they were all too tired to be bothered, every character acted as if they were ready for a retirement home.",2013

It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.",2006
8,"It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence ¬ñ probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale ¬ñ another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development ¬ñ these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.",2006

No HUGE stars (though Kinnear and Arkin are famous and perfectly cast) This film has just great characters, unusual but perfectly understandable circumstances,fantastic dialog, wonderful actors,stunning cinematography, effortless direction and seamless editing.This film was very well received by the audience I sat with. I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried. I heard that this film only cost three million dollars to make...it just goes to show that tens of millions need not be spent to get a treasure. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained. This is one good old-fashioned movie for everyone over 13 (if you preempt the grandfather's language, which is really part of his character). Hope it gets some nominations!!!",2006
9,"We were happy to have had the chance to see this at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. I loved the cast: Greg Kinear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Paul Dano and Steve Carrell were ALL marvelous as the dysfunctional family. Little Miss Sunshine refers to a pageant to be held in California (the movie never states where the family lives, but most of the road scenes were definitely in the Phoenix, Arizona area. (added 8/2/06: I know now that the movie is set in New Mexico, for those of you who are interested in that sort of thing!)",2006
8,"Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy (""Cheaper by the Dozen"") or dark and abstruse (""The Royal Tenenbaums""). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is ""Little Miss Sunshine"", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.",2006
9,"Keeping up with the recent buzz-worthy films coming out of Sundance the past couple years, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem of a movie. After loving crowd favorites Primer (2004) and Hustle and Flow (2005), I wasn't quite sure if the hat trick would be made. Sunshine seemed to have the cast, and direction (the debut of husband/wife team Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, who have helmed some of my favorite music videos including the Smashing Pumpkins' Tonight, Tonight and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Otherside), but the big question would be if it had the laughs to sustain the quirky indie comedy from not being overwrought and boring. While the film definitely has a couple moments where I was about to be lost, everything ends up happening for a reason; emotions are on a roller coaster ride and the lows always come out with meaning and momentum for the highs. Do yourself a favor and see this sweet, subtle at times and gut-bustingly hilarious at others, perfectly pitched ensemble piece.",2006
1,"I have to admit, I was drawn to this movie because of the great cast and a lot of positive word of mouth. I watched the movie in a very good mood and when it was over, I said, what is the big deal? I did not laugh, I did not cry, I did not feel anything, except that I had seen this movie a dozen or more times already. It really was nothing special. Arkin's comedic performance was a rehashed role that I have seen others play. I remember a film called ""Flirting With Disaster"" which was kind of a road movie as well, it was better than this. ""Raising Arizona"" was much funnier than this. The so-called side-splitting ending with the dance to Super Freak was so tipped in commercials that you knew what was coming. Moreover, the dance just keeps going and going, it got so tedious and unfunny. I'm sorry, I don't want to be a cynic, but this film is just being played up way too much and I cannot believe that it was nominated for Best Picture, it was a weak year, but not that weak.",2007
1,"Everyone I know and trust loved this movie and told me they howled with laughter. I simply do NOT get it. If you loved Borat and Napoleon Dynamite, you'll also love Little Miss Sunshine -- I suppose because they are both misanthropic comedies about stupid people.

Me, I really don't get the raves at all considering I think this is one of the 50 worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.",2007
1,"This is a distasteful overly hyped movie. The fact that it is Oscar nominated for best picture gives validation to my disrespect for the Oscars. To think that it is funny for a grandfather to spend hours and hours behind close doors teaching his 7 year old granddaughter an inappropriate dance is a mystery. Further, to nominate the little girl in the movie for an Oscar is a puzzle as well. Nothing that she did in the movie is award worthy, there are any number of children actors that act better and have done a better job in roles than she did, Will Smith's son in Pursuit of happiness for example. And where are the child protection laws when it comes to Hollywood. I question a mother who would allow her daughter to play this role.

For that and many other reasons, it's always good to see a good independent films receiving the praise and recognition they deserve, proving that the support of a big studio is not necessary to make a product of high quality. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" certainly has been luckier than most Indies in terms of budget and cast, but it still is a modest black comedy that takes advantage of its own limitations and relaying only in great acting and a lot of heart, makes more than the hundreds of comedies the big studios make in a year.",2006

The film is quite simply brilliant!! Anyone who truly loves a very real and powerful story about families that will make you laugh as much as it will make you cry must see this film. What makes the film even more impressive is the outstanding ensemble cast that captures every moment of comedy in such a twisted manner that you almost feel guilt for finding the absolute hilarity in their mixed up and disturbed road trip. On top of that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are long time partners who have pioneered direction in music videos and documentaries but never truly a feature film and yet they smash one out of the park with this incredible story.",2006
7,"Little Miss Sunshine was trying to be something it wasn't. It tried to be the amazing feel good dark comedy of the summer, however it just came off average. The problem isn't anyone thing, it just seems to have holes. There are truly beautiful moments, followed by really awkward moments. The acting is wonderful, but there doesn't seem to be an arc for any character; no one seems to progress at all. Steve Correll's(sorry for misspellings) character didn't slowly become less suicidal over the course of the plot, and Greg Kinnear's character seemed to become even more idiotic as time went on. The death of the grandfather and the bringing him along was taken straight from National Lampoon's Vacation, however, it was handled much differently, more serious. The only real character progression was in the character of Dwayne. His story was by far the most well put together. Yet, the setup in the beginning left you ready for a great ride. And, the acting was superb. There isn't any reason not to see this movie. Just don't get your hopes up. Come in with low expectations and you may be surprised.",2006

I generally like Tom Hanks in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  Robert Langdon should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to Hanks occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.  The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - Paul  Bettany is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  Silas to utter perfection. Sir Ian McKellan too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  Audrey Tautou is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played Bezu Fache - Jean Reno was made for the role.  As you'd expect from a Ron Howard Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. Langdon's ""Godspeed"" caused me to  awake in the night sweating!

Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....",2006

I should also note that my extremely religious Christian friends don't find this movie at all ""disturbing"" or ""wrong"". The fact is that if you believe in something, nothing -- including a movie, or story -- should be able to deter you from that belief.

8,"This movie is becoming as controversial as the book. Since the day it was announced that it's gonna be made, there were protests against it being done, and it has escalated to calls for boycotting, or banning the movie altogether. I'll not waste time and go into its controversies, nor discuss what's real and what's not. Neither will I explain in detail the plot, as I believe most of you readers would already have some vague idea of what it's about, or have read the book, since it's on the bestsellers list for months.",2006
10,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the book - it had me hooked more than Harry Potter - and that's saying something (and no I'm not a 10 year old child)! After hearing about the critics' mainly negative views of the film, I approached it without high expectations, and for that, I was rewarded. What I got was an action-packed film that didn't let up until the dying minutes. This film is incredibly faithful to the book (I'm looking at you, Girl With a Pearl Earring!!) to the point where hardly anything is left out, and only minor things have been changed. The visuals are stunning, the acting of Hanks and Tautou is great - and contrary to certain critics opinions - I felt the emotional connection between them. As always, McKlellan is fun to watch, effortlessly bringing Teabing to life, and Reno suffices as Fache. Bettany is fantastic as Silas. The musical score was as good as the visual look of the film - it paired perfectly with the storytelling. Overall, I left the cinema feeling satisfied, because a great book had been turned into a really good film. Approach this film with little expectation, and you will enjoy the ride. Bravo Ron Howard, for doing such a good job.",2006
8,"I've read the book, and the movie's not so bad. Obviously there are many things I'd do different, but in the end it's 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn't that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn't passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That's why it's not a 9 for me.",2006
7,"So I suggest not writing this off as a Hollywood hack film, simply because it's the bandwagon thing to do. Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.",2006
6,"If you take the most popular book in recent years, you should have the most popular movie since The Lord of the Rings, right? Wrong. Though the film was hotly debated, its cinematic quality and popularity aren't nearly as high as one would expect.

8,"I just watched the film, and even though I liked it, I must confess, I too expected more. I can't precisely point out what was missing and what I was expecting, but some it has some details that weren't there, some small imprecisions, some little things could have been better.",2006

1,"What the heck had Ron Howard been drinking when he was directing this? The book may go down in history as the best selling novel of all time but the film may earn the title 'worst movie' of all time. I cannot recall a bigger waste of money and talent. Hanks should be ashamed of himself for agreeing to do this movie.Fair enough he was paid a fortune for his time but to be associated with it is so damaging to a fine actor of his calibre. I won't attempt to write about the plot, or rather the lack of a cohesive narrative, it shoots off at different tangents with too many unexplained threads and is so incredibly poorly done that it felt like a couple of dozen part-time second unit directors had been given a free-hand and allowed to go bananas with the script and plot. I have to admit that I have been a fan of Ron Howard and he has made some pretty good stuff but this... What a complete load of tripe!",2006
1,"By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.

Tom Hanks, Professor of Silly Nonsense at Harry Potter university doesn't make a move on Audrey Tatou. Some stuff happens and they're in a van. Ian McKellen can afford a villa in Portugal by hamming it up egregiously.",2006
9,When I heard that they were bringing out a movie of the best selling book I decided I would see the movie first as I always enjoy books more and didn't want to be disappointed.

It's quite a long movie and every time I thought it was going to end something else happened.,2006

8,"This is a review from a person that has NOT read the book. The critics were never more polarized: some said it was the best film ever and some said it was a horrible film. The most disturbing part was that most of these critics uttered these claims without ever having seen the film. Even the ""journalists"" who saw the first show in Cannes were negative in a way that was almost unheard of. In fact, I have read so many negative reviews (too long, too narrative, boring, predictable, laughable, Tom Hanks ashamed, Ron Howard ashamed, public not amused. etc.) that I was almost tempted not to collect my 2 premiere tickets to the nearby cinema, saving me 20 euro's in the process. My companion (who did read the book, by the way) however insisted and we went. Good, so now I can write about it first hand. Yes, it's a long time to sit with your face directed upwards to the big screen (two and a half hours, plus 15 minutes commercials). Granted, and it contains lots of talking and here and there, some plot movements were indeed incredible and it was quite predictable in certain parts (remember, I did NOT read the book nor did I know the plot), but in whole, it was a fascinating film indeed. Of course, it was a fascinating novel to begin with and personally I found the direction of the film, as well as the parts of most notably Tatou, McKellen and Reno, excellent. I am well aware that, although some points are right on, a considerable part of the story is fiction and some of the facts in the film are dead wrong (unambiguously and easily ascertainable), but most stories, if not all, are. Nothing special about that. Why do many people find exactly this story bad? Simply because of the fact that it is believed to undermine these same people's religious beliefs. But religion itself is based on beliefs, and never the whole truth. This lies within the fundamental definition of what we call religion. Myths are not seldom more true. But that is all irrelevant. Religion itself brings that people will always bend the truth or intermix truth with facts, even facts which are out of place, out of time, or both. Nothing new or spectacular about that. What is spectacular, that this is possibly the most interesting time in recent history in a way that many people start to rethink the whole Christian beliefs. And the fact that the Judas gospel was published also this year, helped tremendously in the process. That process of rethinking belief, that alone is valuable. Many critics wrote from this belief: if you are a fundamentalist Christian, you will most likely hate Brown's book, the film and its message. And if you hate the church, chances are that you love it (I can't think of another reason why over half (616) of the 1176 voters to this instant I write this review, valued this film with a 10 out of 10 (no film in history is worth this)). But both opinions don't count for much, if you ask me, because they are prejudiced ans biased and nothing good ever came from those sentiments. And I can really do without critics who claim you go to hell if you go out and see the film. Hey buddy, I know about hell, I live in The Netherlands... -spoilers after this- Was the a historic person called Jesus the Christ? Probably, but not certainly. Was Jesus the Christ married with Maria Magdalena? Possibly. If yes, did they have children? Possibly. And is Maria Magdalena buried under the Louvre? Unlikely. And is Tatou a direct descendant of Maria Magdalena and Jesus? Very unlikely. Did the Catholic church try to hide Christ's bloodline? I don't think so. Does the church know much more than they say? Certainly. Did the church commit genocide over and over for unholy reasons? Absolutely. Is the new testament complete? Most certainly not - even the translations contain dreadful mistakes. Were there indeed more than 100 gospels instead of 4? Very likely. Is half of Dan Brown's book fantasy? Most likely, yes, but also half is most likely true. but that is again not the issue here. The issue is that if you do have a sufficiently long attention span, if you do have an open mind and if you do have more than half a brain, you may very well enjoy this film. And never stop thinking, no matter who informs you: The Priest, The Politician, The Legislator, The Judge, The Scientist, The Teacher, The Novelist, Mr Gates or the critic. Just never stop thinking...",2006
4,"OK, I read the book like everyone else and loved it! I had the pleasure (or so I thought) of going to see a staff screening of the film with my friend this morning and I had to say I was very very very disappointed! I know films are never as good as the books they are based on but this just wound me up the wrong way completely. I never felt like there was much ""code breaking"" or deep thought involved by any of the characters and It annoyed me the way that things were illuminated as Tom hanks concentrated on them. It felt like it was for idiots to identify where he came up with his conclusions. The acting was very good in regards to all characters but I did feel that Jean Reno was underused and Paul Bettany as Silas wasn't as great as the media have lead us to believe. Sure the monk was misguided but it didn't feel like he really cared that much about finding the keystone/grail...whatever. I felt that everything in the movie was a bit rushed, and the differences in the story from that of the book, just didn't feel right. It kinda went off on a tangent at the end and I felt like a lot of questions went unanswered. The grail guardians also didn't look like they'd stand up to much with the majority of them a few years short of zimmer frames. Overall I'd give this movie 4 out of 10 and it annoys me greatly that It's going to make millions riding on the popularity of the book. If this was an unknown film with another name It would be quickly forgotten.",2006

9,"people keep talking about how awful ""step up"" was, or how it was such a waste of money. but now here are my two cents. it was, in fact, a good movie. the dancing was FABULOUS, and even though the acting could have improved, this movie was nothing short of amazing. the music was catchy and hot, and there was just enough romance in it to make it cute but not gross or sleazy. it had literally EVERYTHING you could ask for in a movie: romance, drama, comedy, and it was even slightly scary at some parts, too. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did a great job. their dancing, along with everyone else's, was phenomenal. when i left the movie, i was actually inspired to be a dancer (even though i never will be.) the main reason people are turning down this movie is because of the acting. sure, the acting could have been better, but this movie was focusing on the DANCING. obviously you have to be a good actor to be in a movie, but the dancing was the main focus of this film. and i personally think the dancing was great. i couldn't ask for it to be better. this movie is definitely worth seeing, whether you're into hip-hop or not.",2006
8,"In Baltimore, the troublemaker and street dancer Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in an Afro-American lower class neighborhood. His best friends are Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington) and they use to hang around together, going to parties and stealing cars. After being expelled of a party, the trio breaks in the Maryland School of Arts and commits vandalism, destroying the stage. Tyler is arrested and sentenced to 200 hours of community service in the school and Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) assigns him to help the janitor cleaning the place. One afternoon, the ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) sees Tyler dancing in the parking area and when her partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain and Tyler offers to help her in the choreography, she accepts the offer; they rehearsal and become close to each other while Tyler becomes friend of the students Miles Darby (Mario) and Lucy Avila (Drew Sidora). When Andrew returns, Tyler that is known for quitting everything he starts gives up dancing and leaves Nora alone. After an incident, Tyler has to decide to follow his dream or return to his life of rebel loser. ",2007
8,"I thought this movie was really good. I'll admit the acting may not have been to it's full potential.. but I still thought it was pretty good. The movie is based on dancing and overall I thought the technique was very good. The talent displayed in this movie is extraordinary. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie. The music in this movie is also really good. I would say this movie is well worth the money I spent. Step Up is inspirational and was everything I was expecting it to be. I'd highly recommend seeing it. If you enjoyed the movie Save The Last Dance this is probably a good movie for you. I found this movie to be very uplifting.",2006
6,"While several portions of this movie were textbook clich√©, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Usually I don't bother with mainstream, commercial movies that are so obviously and unabashedly manufactured to sell to a teenage audience, but I had seen Channing Tatum in She's the Man (another movie that I was hesitant to see, but didn't regret it afterward), and thought he was absolutely gorgeous! Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don't go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",2006
9,"What a wonderful surprise to find such a terrific film of dance and music in STEP UP and the actors/dancers were out of this world. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are magic on the screen and the music is sensational. My friend, Alia, from UCLA, had raved about this film and wanted me to see it, and I am so glad that I did. I found not only the music and dancing, but the story set in the jungle of a big city of young black men and a young white man struggling to survive and come up with fulfilling lives, to be a journey that is true to the lives of so many young men and women today in metropolitan cities in the USA.",2006
4,"Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clich√©d, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.",2007
4,"Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.",2007

It must've been really fun to make this and then watch your progress at the end. I've never taken dance or anything, but watching this movie inspired me. I'd love to take that kind of dance. It's modern ballet right? Well anyways, if you haven't seen this yet, you should. It'll bring you alive. I was just talking about seeing it before but now.. I wanna try it. It seems like you can make anything happen with a friend by your side and somebody to guide you through. Oh and by the way, I give props to the actors. They were greatt.",2006

And there are so many great dancers out there,cause that's what we do when we're young,we dance for fun.

1,"If you are looking for another ""Save the Last Dance"" type of movie, save your money. I'm a professional dancer of 20 years who can never pass up a dance movie, however this one didn't deliver the goods. I was disappointed in the lack of a story that held no depth you can chew on. The story follows a similar theme: Boy is a great b boy dancer who happens to be poor. Girl goes to prestigious art school and is a ballerina. Their worlds clash. They dance together. The end. The story line is very base and boring. The art school director's character is beyond unbelievable. I think her entire character consisted of frowning at b boy dancer as a punctuation to each scene that included him, up until the end. The two leads hardly look young enough to be in high school. Jenna Dewan looks like a 25 year old chain smoker, rather than a fit and healthy dancer. She tried her best to whine and produce teenage angst toward her mother, who was just as boring to watch as she was. Jenna's friend in the movie gets cheated on by her boyfriend, an aspiring singer. Predictable. The music was dull and uninspiring. Personally I couldn't wait to leave. I wanted to walk out on the film, yet at the same time wanted to give it a chance. If you truly want to see this film, wait until the last 15 minutes of it, walk in and sit down to see the ""senior recital"", where girl and b boy boyfriend get on the stage and do a decent production number, but then it's over. This was about the only interesting part of the entire 98 minutes.",2006
9,"""step up"" has become one of my favorite movies...the actors are great but the dance scenes really take my breath away and i love the music... it must have required a lot of practice but then again, Jenna danced with P.Diddy and Janet Jackson so it wasn't so hard for her... i wish i could dance like her. i actually took dancing lessons when i was little but it was nothing compared to this... i would love to take up dancing again.it's the best way to forget about problems. every time i watch this movie it gives me a new lease of life and makes me tell myself ""hey! i should do that!"" but it's just a dream... i'm out of practice... :P",2006
3,"hello folks. i saw this movie. yeah, i can't believe it either. i REALLY didn't want to see it but i had to fulfill a promise (i said i'd go with my friend, who had a part as an extra in it), so there I was at the theater on a Friday morning, waiting for ""Step Up"" to begin. i gotta say i should have bought eight tickets, and reserved all seats in a 360 degree radius of myself, that way no one would have been affected by the splash damage of my vomit. this movie was audacious. granted, my opinion of the movie was low from the start, but i can assure you if you DID NOT like what you saw in the advertisements, you need to ESPECIALLY stay far away. the story is bad enough (this has all been done before, especially in ""save the last dance""), and it's made even worse by the terrible actors. What's with all the hype for Channing Tatum? He wasn't very good in ""coach carter"", and he's downright terrible in this (i'm looking for a deleted scene where he cuts his arm and you can see his robotic circuitry underneath). Jenna Dewam is not a good leading lady, she makes no strides to prove she has any acting chops at all. I've seen scarface do better lines than her. A large portion of my problems rest with the cast, they must've picked these guys up from the trash bin outside the set of Dawson's Creek or something, because everything they say oozes of coy, bipolar emotive, over-the-top yet completely nonsensical dialogue. seriously this movie is like a soundboard, where random phrases are strewn together to make a somewhat coherent, but awkward dialogue. the actors don't deliver but a lot of the blame also goes to the writers, who wrote this crap? if someone tells me ""you don't know what you're getting yourself into..."" i think of more serious things associated with that phrase, like joining the yakuza or Scientology, but not a warning to the tribulations of learning how to friggin' dance! and speaking of dancing, for those people who are solely seeing this movie for that very aspect, you can find more exciting stuff elsewhere. the footwork is very mundane, and not as thrilling as the ads play it out to be. i'd stick with MTV. All in all, this movie was just plain bad. Not ""uwe boll so bad it's good"" kinda bad, but ""tricking the teens/pre-teens/dates into paying for a big steaming turd"" bad. I don't know if Hollywood is doing some kind of science experiment to see if they can get people to see their terrible movies by baiting it with popular music, cool slang, and ""fresh young talent"", but I implore you guys to not see this waste of celluloid. Things like this and John Tucker Must Die aren't even of the same pedigree of the ""stupid but semi-fun"" teen movies that were trouncing around 5 or 6 years ago... this movie needs to STEP DOWN.",2006

I would say 70% of the people watching this movie with me walked out. I recommend bringing a pillow and a blanket to the movie in case you fall asleep like the majority of the people did. It did so bad in fact that the movie theaters as already stop playing it in under a week. I wouldn't want to see anyone else waist their money on this movie. This movie is nothing but for low self esteem teenagers and for geeks. No wonder none of the critics liked it. Be smart save your money.",2006
8,"I enjoyed watching this movie with my four teens. I showed how teens can turn their life around no matter what type of situation that they are in. It also showed how different classes in society can come together and help one another. The inner city kids tend to get a bad wrap a lot of the time, and it was good to see some of them come out on top. It was also AWESOME to see how the music and art program in the middle of a busy town can help redirect a youth's focus. We need more schools of the arts in our cities. I wish that congress would grab a hold of this concept and stop cutting our education budget for our children. Because the children of our generation and the ones to come are the future, and by the looks of it we are going to be in trouble.",2006

I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. The music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well. And what's with the Channing Tatum ""hotness"" that all the girls talk about? Whatever. The movie was pathetic. Don't waste your time - or your money.

Those people who rate it too low aren't just being fair enough, I'm pretty sure they have seen many dance movies, but if Step Up was their first dance movie they watched, then i'm pretty sure that they would give it a much higher rating than what it is getting now.",2006

This one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal. With this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but upon going into the theater I was thinking another drug/beer/frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in (aka an ""American Pie"" flick) but I was surprised. To sum it up, I enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies, look for show times to ""Accepted"". If you want to laugh out loud, that is.",2006
8,"This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message. (But you don't need to buy the message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is, as usual, hilarious, and Blake Lively is a fresh faced beauty. ",2006
9,"From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' The humour was varied which I loved. All the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!",2007
8,I for one was very anxious to watch this movie.,2006
7,A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.,2006
7,"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.",2006
7,"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.",2006
10,"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision. The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. I give it two thumbs way up!",2006
10,"I went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. Telling from my first sentence I don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but I loved it. Justin Long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and I loved it. Lewis Black....enough said. The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it? Yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, To go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didn't think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to. The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. They played in to the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald(Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy)and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as B's Friends. I recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line!~!",2006
10,"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..",2006
9,"Look, the plot is preposterous and unrealistic but the film is so much fun it's charms won me over. Long is a likable lead, but honestly he's too cool to be portrayed as such a disregarded kid. I would watch him and how the film wants to create this downgraded high school kid who couldn't get into a decent college and is portrayed as such a loser...but he's got all these charismatic qualities that sort of challenge that perception of school invisibility where his character appears uncool and abandoned by the cliques that determine worth as a recognized figure amongst his peers. When Blake Lively takes to Long, it isn't the same as Montgomery going gaga for Carradine in Revenge of the Nerds. He seems like just the kind of guy who could appeal to her. Jonah Hill, still pre-stardom and on the heavier side at this point in his career, is the buddy of Long who is attending an ivy league school treating him like a fool. Lively is dating frat prick Travis Van Winkle who mistreats Hill, while Long, Columbus Short, Maria Thayer, and Adam Herschman join forces to start a fake college accepting all the kids not good enough for all the other schools. S.H.I.T (South Harmon School of Technology) becomes party central and all the college undesirables are happy go lucky, free to be themselves and get involved in building this college into something more than a place to crash on the parents' dime. Culinary, art, meditation, and this wall chalkboard that allows the students to comment on what they want from the collegiate experience become a starting place for the school to thrive. Stripper hotties wanting more, with one of them put in charge of school outfits, a vert ramp in the yard for skateboarding, a pool for the kids to swim, rock music, and this active and wild contingency of youth coming together as Long determines to corral them into achieving their own dreams outside of the traditional college curriculum. PG-13 rating pushed to the brink just by a game Lewis Black as this anti-establishment former teacher who speaks his mind, bluntly and profanely, lending a hand to Long and his crack team of friends out of their depth at the beginning. Van Winkle's pop (Anthony Heald) wants the land Long's school occupies (a leased dump: former mental hospital!) so he starts trouble. Eventually Long will have to deal with a board of accreditation in the hopes of legitimizing the school. Clearly this cast of talented performers shot from the hip a great deal and while the film is mostly commenting somewhat on academic inequality and voicing for a different kind of collegiate attitude for those students not recognized as worthy of schools limiting who deserves to be accepted, more often than not, there's some laughs to be had here. Could wind up being a college comedy cult classic. Mark Derwin, as the uptight and disappointed dad, and Ann Cusack, as the sorrowed mother, rebounding from their pain of their son's lack of success in getting in a college when the fake school tricks them into believing he was on his way becomes quite amusing as the ruse is more and more difficult to maintain. The students becoming enthralled with Black's ramblings, even giving him a standing ovation, tells what kind of comedy this is. This was a nice surprise.",2016
5,"For all the obvious merit that this movie does not have, I liked it. I just couldn't help myself. The story is pretty stupid and unbelievable, the characters aren't really characters at all (just stereotypes), and there is nothing real in this movie at all. None of the relationships are convincing, and the ending is far too contrived.",2006
8,"This movie deserved a better class of reviews and definitely a higher rating than it actually has. In my opinion, Accepted is based on one of the most relevant topic of our generation wherein the agony and feelings of all those students who due to one reason or another are unable to get accepted to a good enough college after completion of their high school. The central character played by Justin long who when unable to get accepted to any College starts an Unaccredited college along with a few of his friends so as to fulfill the expectations and dreams of his family. ",2011
5,"That's a very good idea. It is a fact that today's learning institutes aren't encouraging the creativity of the children...they encourage the fierce competition...between them...period. The movie is a teen movie, far better and way more entertaining and educative than any American pie or other junk... It's obvious that the movie isn't perfect...but what movie is? I gave it a 10 (ten with congratulations) for the brilliant idea -->> to give a chance to all...not only the rich and/or smart children of the rich and/or smart people... The final note of this movie is very positive, and I liked this a lot... because not the fat rich kids are becoming our favorite models in life... the poor kids that are struggling for something... and that idea impressed me.",2007
6,"Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) has not had any luck getting into a single college, so in order to get his parents off his back, he creates the South Harmon Institute of Technology but before he and his friends can enjoy slacking off there, hundreds of applicants show up to be admitted to the one college that won't turn them down.",2007
6,"""Accepted"" has more than its fair share of comic moments and characters. That's the fortunate thing about making a movie about goofy people. Unfortunately, it takes its self too seriously and continuously hits us over the head with the ""Losers are OK too"" message.",2006
2,"this movie was downright awful. most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow, but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some ""inspirational"" speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.",2006
2,"Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. He either has the best agent in Hollywood, or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. The only film that he has attempted to anchor that I've remotely enjoyed was Waiting... and that is almost solely because I've worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow. The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). His one liners were funny on occasion, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this, but I can't recommend it at all.",2007
6,"Tell the truth I enjoy every single teen movie, and I have seen a whole lot of it, A Whole Lot. I categorize them and this one got to be the light weight teen comedy.

6,"As far as summer movies go, this one sets no new standard of excellence. It has the common formula, lots of cheap gags, a romance sub-plot, and an inspirational message at the end. The same formula that has been plugged into summer comedy for about 7 years. (Rat Race, for instance). This one also has trouble deciding between an inspirational piece, or an all out party movie (i.e. Animal House). The blending between both aspects of the story is done well, and some of the characters in the movie are just plain funny in their antics. This isn't one that your breath will be taken away by, but it is definitely funny, and, it at least attempts to give the audience a lesson in finding their purpose after high school.",2006
1,"Seriously,i decided to watch a movie to get some laughs and chill and i bumped into this.After reading some reviews i decided to give it a go with the expectation this movie to be at least as half as good the reviews demonstrated.However to my bad luck i realised i just wasted 93 minutes of my life that i,unfortunately,cannot take back ever again.",2014
1,"I see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted to any college. Even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down. The actors portrayed characters straight out of Characterville. We have seen their lot many a time over in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on late night TV, and since there was really nothing else on, I watched the whole boring, stupid film. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you may find it amusing. Films are made for an immature mind, so teens, go for it. The rest, no way.",2007
10,"I think the problem with most people is that they take things seriously that weren't supposed to be taken seriously. If you go into Accepted expecting Oscar gold, you are going to be disappointed, but if you go into the movie expecting nothing, except maybe a few laughs, then you will leave happy! I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I loved all the one liners, and the sarcasm. Plus, the names of some of the classes are GREAT! The story line is pretty basic, the tragic hero, something good happens, someone bad tries to wreck it, there's a girl, hazing, a courtroom, and then... battle royale! There are a few slow points in the film, and Bartleby's parents and sister are a little underdeveloped as characters, at least the sister has a little something going for her. For the most part, this was one of the better movies to hit mainstream theaters this summer. Go see it, have a laugh.",2006
8,"On the face of it, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some starlet's boobs or be a vehicle for some never-was like Tom Green.",2006
8,"Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).",2006
8,"This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. ",2006
8,"Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.",2006
10,"As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist.

Everything that is brought into the movie as being there for our hero's to overcome, is still there when the credits roll those ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES finally end. Two and a half hours, just to set up a third movie? I'm sorry, but that has to be the biggest rip off since Manhatten and those beads and trinkets used to buy it.",2006

Johnny Depp was brilliant, the story was fun, it was immensely entertaining, even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does. But this thing?

9,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here).

It was one hundred percent better than the first one, actually. It was still action packed, funny, and it features people you would not expect, I was even dropping my jaw the whole time! If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, you're going to have to love this one too. Of course, Johnny Depp's acting is still wonderful as the last one, as well as Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's. The effects are absolutely stunning and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do suggest though, if you have not seen the first one, you need to see that before going to see this one..otherwise, you're going to be a ""tad"" clueless on some parts. The movie does total justice and I would see it again and again!",2006

This movie has some of the best visual effects I have ever seen with the exception of the 10th Kingdom. Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It was also very funny. Also I thought the man who played the evil guy who wanted Jack's compass was a very good actor but I didn't like his part.",2006
10,"I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did.

Davy Jones and the Island scenes seemed like two different movies. This movie didn't solve anything. Norrington was the only character that grew. Jack Sparrow's character was changed from a crooked good man to. . . I don't even know. His character was extremely shallow and humorless. It felt as though a two year old designed his character. The characters that we knew and loved became warped in this movie. Will just sulked his way through the movie, and I don't even know what was up with Elizabeth. And what was with that horrible ending? Asking if they wanted to go on a new adventure was lame, a letdown, and a horrible way to finish off the movie.The only good thing I can see about this movie is that there is no way the third one can be any worse.

The voodoo lady was hard to understand. I caught every other words she said. I'm sure I'll get all of the humor when I buys this DVD and play her section with the CC on! I didn't quite understand the reason behind the part of the movie with the tribal people other than it gave the movie more action scenes.

When approached by Davy Jones, you can truly believe that Depp is at his wits end with desperation. When Depp faces the Kracken, you can see that he has reached a point where he cannot take it anymore and perhaps truly wishes for his ultimate demise.",2006

8,"I haven't seen the original, but I now want to because this movie rocked. The movie starts as a slow-boil suspense/horror movie, provides some decent jump-scares (at least in the theater) and spends some time building up character. The movie then switches gears and turns into a gritty, brutal horror movie more the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and further switches to gears to a action/revenge movie, but still with horror elements. It's scary, sick, nearly uncompromising (the unrated cut will undoubtedly be so) and disturbing, but also adrenaline-filled and riveting. Certainly NOT for the weak-stomached person. People were leaving the theater, and the IMDb boards are rife with people damning the movie for it's 'lack of moral substance' and 'taste'. This movie isn't for the average movie-goer. It's for the horror buffs. Alexendre Aja should be proud, and is 2-for-2 in my book having done this and High Tension.",2006
7,Shocking. Disturbing. At times hard to watch. All words to describe the horror of being forced to watch Michael Moore take his shirt off. But these terms also accurately describe this brutally vicious upgrade on Wes Craven's 1977 low-budget horror classic.,2006
9,"We've seen dozens of remakes in the past several years: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ring, Dawn of the Dead, The Fog. None could hold a candle next to the original films.",2006
1,The Hills Have Eyes is yet another unnecessary horror remake that relies on shock and gore instead of true horror that comes from playing upon our fears.,2006
9,"I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"", to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project ""Haute Tension"" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies...",2006
1,"I'm not sure why anyone would watch this - to watch graphic violence, to be grossed out by the moronic mutants, or laugh as the armed male protagonists turn tail and run when presented with a clear opportunity for a killing blow on those that have terrorised them? One minute, the boy is running away from an unarmed mutant, shooting blindly behind him, the next he has the awareness to set a booby-trap for the same mutant - and when it blows, he laughs, having witnessed his mother's heart being eaten moments before? There's no dark humour, and it's difficult to care for most of the protagonists, apart from the young mother, who gets killed anyway. Awful.",2006
8,"My husband did not make it past the first hour of this movie. I had to watch the rest alone. It is psychologically terrifying...one of those movies that takes hold of you, makes you scream at the screen, and leaves you with a disturbed feeling for hours after the final credits roll. There was nothing profound about the premise, and nothing Oscar-worthy about the acting, but it was an all-around great horror film. The special effects were good...lots of gore and violence. It's suspenseful, dark, and is guaranteed to leave you with a creepy feeling that won't let you go to sleep right after watching it. I watched three hours of SEINFELD reruns, and had nightmares anyway. That's the way it should be! ;)",2006
8,"(Synopsis) The movie begins with the showing of original footage from some of the 311 nuclear tests that were carried out by the U.S. government in the desert of New Mexico during the years 1945-1992. The government had ordered the local residents to move so they wouldn't get hurt by the atomic tests. But some of the residents (miners) refused to leave their homes, and were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. The miners went to the mines and survived, but their newborn children were genetically altered. The children are now adults, and to survive in the desert, they murder and rob tourists going through the desert. They are not only insane murderers, but they have become blood-thirsty cannibals. The Carter family has an accident in the desert, and they are about to become the next victims. However, Big Bob Carter, (Ted Levine), a retired police detective, isn't going to let that happen.",2006
1,Congratulations!,2007
1,"now I've seen the original and I've seen the remake, and i gotta tell ya it's becoming a trend to make horrible remakes of original movies. Let's use Dawn of the Dead for example, the original was great because it focused on surviving from a horde of undead flesh eating monsters. But what kills it in the new one is the fact that the zombies....run. Zombies do 2 things, shuffle and eat. That's what made them scary, you could run away from a bunch of them, point and laugh, then look behind you and there'd be 100 more, making them run ruins it. But back to this pile of garbage called a remake of a classic. It's really almost the same movie only they tried to add a back story and just put in items that are in the same time period. Hey genius', what made the old ones great is that they were simple, family lost in desert attacked by weirdos. But this one ""ooh they didn't wanna leave this nuclear test site and now we're freaks, whaaa"" Oh, and also to reiterate just how horrible this movie was, I asked a bunch of people why they wanted to see it and you know what the told me? ""Oh I wanna see it because it has a rape scene in it"". Is that what this world has come to? Is that how low we've evolved to as human beings? That some retards actually WANT to see a woman carnally assaulted? I pray for you people, that in some small hope that you go beyond that mind set. -2 stars.",2007
10,"A remake it was... yes a remake, and of a classic horror movie too that  was good enough as it was, however... in a world of terrible remakes  and sequels, this was something that was far from terrible.  I would like to say first and foremost, that I was pleased with Aja's  first film ""High Tension"", the man has talent, and he put it to good  use here: A gory, insane, slasher type horror thriller that was the  opposite of cheesy. It really was creepy, and that is extremely hard to  do these days. It had great character structure, you can identify with  and care for the people who are going through this hell. Not many  horror movies do that, it's not even their job, however, it worked for  this film.   now that we know the character structure was believable, The story, oh  yes, the story itself, which we already seen in the original, was a bit  far fetched... but it was interesting and thrilling. In a way,  believable, because there wasn't much of anything in the movie  happening that one would refer to as bull****  like what tends to  happen in most of the rather bad films they make nowadays.   Great fight scenes, well choreographed, great realistic, really  disturbingly graphic looking gore FX, the acting for both the victims  and the killers all done well by these mostly relatively newer, lesser  known actors, who all did great jobs at portraying.   All that I can say about this film, in my humble opinion is: one of the  thrilling, more fun horror films that has came out in the past few  years. Right on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this beats the hell  out of crap like the Ring, The Grudge, Boogeyman, The Fog and other  watered down, pussified horror remakes. If you want scary, than see  this film. But I must warn thee: It is definitely not for the faint of  heart, so leave the littl eones at home.",2006
8,"The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is ""why remake a classic?"", but the question I ask of this one is ""why call it The Hills Have Eyes?"" Many films have been made before and after Wes Craven's original shocker with similar ideas, so why not take the basic plot idea and give it a new title; thus making it a new film. Judged on its own merits, Alexandre Aja's exploitation horror flick is actually a good film, but it loses credibility unnecessarily just because it's a part of the remake crowd. After an explosive beginning which gives you an idea of what Aja intends to do with the remake; the pace relaxes a little as we get to know the doomed family at the centre of the piece. While this may not be very exciting, it pays dividends towards the end when the mutant cannibals start to get their own way. We follow a family who decide to take a holiday that involves driving through the desert. After fuelling their car, the helpful petrol station attendant tells them of a shortcut in the desert; but after they have a crash, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't the only ones amidst the nuclear hills.",2006
1,"Another remake, another waste of everyone's time. Hollywood has become a thrift store for tired plots. Take this garbage movie for example: A family takes a road trip. Guess what happens next? The car breaks down! Guess what happens next? Psycho mutants pick off family members one by one. Guess what happens next? A main character emerges from among the survivors and proceeds to decimate the mutants in ludicrous fashion. It's like The Evil Dead meets an even crappier version of The Evil Dead with mutants modeled after that ugly fellow from The Goonies.",2006
6,"This film is genuinely creepy and effective.Mostly due to its atmosphere.The cinematography serves as an effective technique to scare people.Here is one film that is disturbing and fun at the same time. The story is quite interesting and thankfully not ruined by its execution.It doesn't play like the usual horror slasher ,where a madman starts slashing teens throughout the film with endless amount of gore.This movie is more of a psychological horror thriller.",2006
1,"**SPOILERS** Utterly idiotic, sadistic garbage. If watching underage girls get raped by deformed freaks and then turning into superheroes and defeating the freaks' evil plot is your thing, you might like this 'film'. Totally unrealistic, the bad guys' motivations are never really explained- we know they were deformed from 'nuclear fallout', but we're never told why the freaks turn to cannibalism. The film moves along from one 'jump out and yell boo' scare to the next, stopping occasionally to rub the viewer's face in some sort of gross-out scene, and then it's back to the predictable cardboard cutout scares. ",2006
1,"I am a big fan of horror movies and have am fairly good at watching gore. I went into this movie expected a bloody, slightly frivolous, but fun, movie. I left about an hour into it crying hysterically and about to vomit. Bloody deaths are one thing, but watching a father being burned alive at the stake while his teenage daughter is being raped by mutants and his other daughter is having her breast milk sucked out of her by another mutant who is holding her BABY AT GUNPOINT is another. I was getting my coat when the girls' mother comes into the trailer to defend her daughters and gets shot in the chest by the mutant with her (now crisp) husband's gun. I was too distraught to ask for my money back but I wish I had. The ""blood bath"" in this film was not-only excessive, but offensive. If this movie had an underlying message behind the deaths, I may have been able to objectively quantify the film, but gruesomeness for the sake of shock value alone is not worth $9.50 and my Friday night.",2006
1,I knew the movie was going to be horrible when the plot is based on the fact that there was nuclear testing.,2006
5,"This remake of the Wes Craven classic is nowhere near as good. Certainly it has some great moments and visual images and the idea of a ""modern"" family having to fight off a family of savages is a frightening one, but some where along the way it lost its teeth. Certainly the fact that the studio asked that some of the more subversive touches of the original (baby for dinner anyone?) be trimmed doesn't help. It also doesn't help that this film has inspired countless remakes an homages over the last 30 years. Worse, I don't know how many retreads I saw in the last year. Why remake a film if you're going to de-claw it and then take the same path as every other film maker. Its pointless. Worse its about 20 minutes longer than the original film and as a result this film tends to stagger about for a good while before it seems to get its focus. Its not bad, but the remake is better and more out there. Given the choice, see the original.",2006

Unbeknownst to the Carter's, another family lives in the high desert hills, a clan of irradiated mutant cannibals who set a clever trap for the Carter's. One minor car crash later, the Carter's are stranded in the middle of nowhere. Bob Sr. and Doug head off in opposite direction looking for help, leaving the women and children alone. When night falls, the cannibals descend upon the Carter's, raping, killing and stealing baby Catherine away.

9,Firstly I would like to agree with the first reviewer. If it is graphic violence and gore you want then this will be the equivalent to a Wet Dream for you. The make up artists should have had an Oscar nomination for the mutants. When Ruby takes the baby to protect her and the baby's father searches the house and the deformed kids ask him to play was one of the highlights for me.,2006
10,"There's one word to describe this horror masterpiece: riveting. I never gave Alexandra Aja the serious chance as a filmmaker to impress me. I viewed his previous film, ""High Tension"", and was entertained, yet not so much to the point where I was having a blast. Then ""The Hills Have Eyes"" trailers started to pop up and I checked out who was the director. I almost moaned when I saw Aja's name, but decided I'd give it a chance, seeing as I was already a fan of the original ""Hills"". I paid, I sat down in the theater, and...wow. I'll never doubt Alexandra Aja as a filmmaker again! This is truly a horror-drama, when carefully looked at from all the elements. You have the familiar story of the slightly dysfunctional family who become trapped in the least-liked place in the world. How do you scare us? Throw in mutant cannibals! Truly original and highly unexpected. The directing was phenomenal compared to the other crap we receive from horror films *cough**cough* ""Silent Hill"". The acting is truly believable. I was even stunned to find that veteran actors such as Ted Levine were totally committed to this project. Also, the make-up...friggin' creepy and it works! I completely forgot that they were actors and really believed they were these mutated freaks! I mean, I was chanting throughout the film, ""Please kill that guy"", ""Please kill that big woman"". The suspense is well built and even made me jump, 'cause I'm one of those people whose hard to scare at horror films. Alexandra Aja has directed a beautiful, gory, suspenseful masterpiece and will surly go down in cinematic (and horror) history as, not only a great remake, but an excellent horror film as well.",2006
9,"This is a very entertaining show. The writing is good, the characters are both interesting and multi-dimensional. The lighting and set design are very appropriate for a mainstream network series. Excellent use of steady-cam and ""documentary style"" camera work.",2006
8,I might not be the expert on Special Forces but I do have some military experience. The show is a situational show not a documentary so the authors tried and in my opinion succeeded in illuminating some sides of this mostly secretive part of the military. Some situational mistakes are laughable (black man in Belorussia would stand out as the palm tree in the Antarctica) and language accents are horrific at times but at the end the show is highly watchable and propagates the thought that in real situation members of the real Unit will be up to the task. I think the effort of the cast on portraying the military should be respected and military consultants on the show are respected and well know men. It was enormously satisfying to see the show of this caliber on regular TV. I am looking forward to the 3rd season,2007
8,"As of this writing, the best show on television that no one talks about. Is it easier to overlook military-themed shows, being as their viewership is made up of middle America? But The Unit is neither a gussied-up procedural (NCIS) nor a rousing commercial (Jag), and it betrays almost no political agenda. It keeps to these guys, their job, and their families, all facing challenges that are alternately far beyond and extremely similar to those of our own. Like most Mamet, it is characterized not so much by distinctive characters as it filled with plain ol' drama. The show is as clipped, professional, and dutiful as its characters¬ó¬†no 'special-episodes', no sweeps- month stunts.",2007
10,"I quite enjoyed the first episode in this new series. One of the things i liked was the fact that they show the families and the impact on them as well as the fun and games that the men have. I look forward to the future episodes where they develop the characters. While I was not surprised by the plot line, I thought that it was time that more information about the worlds special forces was released to the public in a format to entertain as well as educate. While the production have taken some liberties to keep us entertained and interested, its better to have it on the Television than yet another aspect of military life ignored as if it doesn't exist. While the people who are in the special forces will probably spot numerous flaws, we, the public do not have their in-depth knowledge. Some of the public will complain because its not fully of 24/7 action, looks at more than death and actually might make us think.",2006
9,"I'm a big fan of Dennis Haysbert so I bought the first season having never seen the show before. The first episode had a couple of scenes that almost killed all my enthusiasm for it, but I hung with it; got into the characters and enjoyed the whole season. It' takes some getting used to watching the episodes cut back and forth to the soldiers on their missions and their wives back home; that just isn't how ""war movies"" are done my sexist old brain says. But while the action scenes are really well done the ""home stories"" are surprisingly compelling too. As someone who grew up on 'Combat"", 'The Rat Patrol', 'Twelve O'Clock High' I am surprised I liked this new show as much as I did. Well worth purchasing the first season.",2006
9,"The Unit is a one of the kind show far as i know. It does not only look at the special forces operatives lives but what revolves around them.

I wish it hadn't been canceled because there was so much more that could have been done with this series... So many more stories to tell.

I got annoyed at a few of them but overall was pleased because almost every episode was entertaining, and, hey, that's the name of the game. I would have preferred they had stuck to the military action stories each week and skipped the soap operas, but I understand they want more than just a male audience.

2,"I liked very much this show, until they completely slandered my country of origin, Bulgaria. Just for the information of the readers: 1. Bulgaria is a NATO country since more than 3 years. 2. Bulgaria will be part of the European Community, starting January 2007 3. There is FBI office in Bulgaria. 4. There is US Military office in Bulgaria. 5. There are bi-lateral treaties for extradition between the USA and Bulgaria. 6. If a new method of tracking prisoners in Bulgaria is proposed, it should go through the Ministry of Justice (Justice Departmen). No warden in Bulgaria can take this decision, much less on the spot, no matter how corrupted he is (it's true, there are still corrupted people there), because he risks prison for doing that. 7.On the Bulgarian roads, the dividing line is white, not yellow, like in Santa Clarita in California, where the episode was shot. 8. All actors representing ""Bulgarians"" couldn't talk Bulgarian - they were Macedonians, Russians and Serbians. Hence the physical appearance - horrible. 9. It's time somebody in Hollywood to buy a map and make some elemental research (CNN and US Embassy in Bulgaria would be enough) and stop to mis-represent small countries which are giving the life of their Soldiers in Afganistan and Iraq to help the Americans.",2006
1,"This show is terrible, full of clich√©s, paper thin characters, unrealistic action, you can almost hear the soldiers yelling ""yee hah"" when they jump into action. I would find it very hard for any real soldier to watch this without shaking their head and laughing. I can't believe Dennis Haysbert can say his lines with a straight face. I can't believe he didn't put on a bullet proof vest when he storms the plane in one of the episodes. The back story with the wives is terrible, Regina Taylor and Abby Brammell come across as a scary combination of Stepford wives and GI Jane. If you want to watch something realistic try ""Band of Brothers"". Watching this reminds me of ""Team America"" and we all know that was a satirical comedy with puppets! At least ""24"" knows it's a story. At least ""CSI"" has an element of truth. I think the producers are actually trying to pass this off as a serious show. It amazes me that David Mamet had a hand in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""Wag the dog"" and ""The Untouchables"" all very above average movies I enjoyed. I am amazed this show got to a second season.",2006

10,"The Irish, like the Danes, live in a small country which has produced its fair share of theatre, film, and TV drama. This excellent RTE police series is no 'Celtic Twilight' story, but is instead a disturbing exploration of the under-surface of modern Irish society as it extends even to such a remote place as County Galway, beside the Atlantic Ocean. The hero of the series, superbly and quietly played by Owen McDonnell (who was born in Galway and has its soil in his bones), is a young sergeant in the Irish police, who are known as 'the Garda' (a Gaelic name). This review is of the entire 12 episodes produced so far, comprising Seasons One and Two. It is not known if there will be any more, but I hope so. It is a very absorbing series which goes at a gentle pace, revealing intrigues and crimes slowly, rather than at the breathless pace of a Hollywood film which has to squeeze everything into 90 minutes. McDonnell's father had been a senior Garda figure, and in Season One, McDonnell comes face to face with the fact that he had been dishonest and criminal in his job, as most of his colleagues had also been. McDonnell is a thoroughly honourable man struggling to keep his honest nose above sea level in this wholly corrupt place. The series is shot entirely on location and the scenery is remarkable for its bleak beauty, a nearly treeless landscape running down to a shattered sea and endless shimmering water dusted by drifting clouds, with spectacular sunsets. The area is extremely isolated and under-populated. The locals are deeply inbred and introverted, clannish, secretive, suspicious, brutal, and, well, Irish, which means they can also be charming and amusing while they are scheming against you. The wickedest character in the series is a perfect serpent, retired Garda Inspector Dennis Costello, played with sinuous menace and cunning by Sean McGinley. He runs the local pub called Mallons, a den of iniquity, scheming, and plotting. Everyone in the area seems consumed by greed, lust, perversity, or unnatural passions of one kind or another, and none of them are honest apart from stalwart Owen McDonnell, whose character is called Jack Driscoll. If anyone ever wondered how so many murders could possibly be committed in the small town of Oxford in order to justify the INSPECTOR MORSE series, try County Galway for limitless decadence. How can such a desolate place be seething with such much corruption, brutality, and quiet crime? The series is clearly meant to be a reflection upon contemporary Ireland, a country where all the politicians are said to be corrupt, where all the businessmen are said to be corrupt (and I have met some of those!), and where incest, rape, murder, brutality of every kind imaginable, and of course the sexual perversities and crimes of the Catholic clergy, are rampant. It is also a country where greed ran amok and resulted in the economic collapse from which Ireland is still struggling, with doubtful success, to make some kind of recovery. There are some powerful performances by supporting players in this series, especially the sinister and knowing mother of McDonnell, played by Ruth McCabe, who conveys as much by her eyes as many actors do when they scream. She refuses to condemn the immorality of her late husband and thinks her son is a fool for being such a 'good guy', which certainly is a new angle on the cozy mum theme, for she will sit down and have a nice cup of tea while justifying dishonesty and immorality. McDonnell's bewilderment and exasperation at the hypocrisy and dishonesty he finds on all sides never breaks him, but he looks sadder and sadder, and says a great deal when he does not speak, rather like those silent Danes in THE KILLING Part One (see my review). If the Irish can produce a series like this, they have not lost their touch. Let's have more.",2012
10,This is a wonderful show with fantastic scenery. It reminds me of my trip to Ireland many years ago. The characters seem to be REAL PEOPLE and the scripting is really true to life. They are certainly not artificial as are the American actors that we have to put up with. The story lines are true to life. Even the bad characters are very well acted. I wish American TV would take a lesson from this program when they are making our shows. I believe that the Garda is depicted in a realistic fashion. Perhaps that is why I like it since my Grandfather was a Detective with the same kind of attributes I will watch it many times and I hope that you do also.,2013
6,"While the concept behind the series is an interesting one, the stories and writing is just not that good. The plots are hard to follow, and at times the story moves from A to C without ever going to B. This leaves the viewer confused. I think a better job could have been done with continuity and better editing. In some of the episodes, the scenes seem to be inserted in a random order as if no story-board was used to show plot development. The acting is all very good, and the scenery of the west coast of Ireland, stunning. It is a series set in contemporary Ireland, and so has all the integral pieces of modern culture e.g. drug use, deviant behavior, corruption. It does show that it's not all idyllic in this beautiful setting.",2016

We have so few good police based shows on British television, unlike America, and when we get a good one it disappears in a puff of smoke. 55 dgrees North was another basic policeman show.

That was 2 months back and I've just concluded a second viewing, including the final episode I'd not seen fully the first time round. I have to admit my primary motive was to revisit the landscape and do some place-spotting but the quality of the drama kept distracting me from my touristic infatuation with the Republic of Ireland generally and Connemara, specifically. At times villains of the stories can be a bit over the top, but for the most part I thoroughly enjoy the writing, the acting and of course, the setting.

9,"The legendary Broadway musical hit the screen, resurrecting the thrill of the original. That, in itself, is a miracle. I suspect that the miracle worker is Bill Condon. The story is told as if it revealed something we've never seen before and his winning innocence triumphs. The casting of Eddie Murphy was a stroke of genius. He unfolds a new inedited face and I predict a new career. The predictability of the tale becomes rewarding rather than annoying and I was surprised and moved all the way through. Jammie Foxx's unsympathetic turn manages to deliver a punch of humanity. Byonce Knowles, Danny Glover and the rest of the cast are a perfect foil for Jennifer Hudson's Cinderella Story. Bravo Mr Condon!",2007
9,"What a spectacular movie musical experience! This is one worth waiting in line, if not purchasing advance tickets for. Beautifully realized by writer-director Bill Condon, 'Dreamgirls' brings back thoughts of a few years ago when the movie musical version of 'Chicago' knocked our socks off, and (with the help of the gorgeous 'Moulin Rouge') helped to revive the modern movie musical. The sets, costumes, musical numbers all flow beautifully and make for an incredibly affecting motion picture.",2006
10,"Fantabulous. Stupendous. I can't even believe it. I've changed my pick for Best Picture this year so many times you'd think I have multiple personalities. But let me tell you it's just been a tremendous year for film. Kudos all around. I tell you none of the BP nominees last year, could compete this year. And I loved Brokeback Mountain and Munich.",2007
4,"Dreamgirls, despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway, has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?), but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has ""no father"" and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.",2007
4,"I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY underimpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair. Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!",2007
10,"I went to a trade screening of ""Dreamgirls"" a few days ago and from the first seconds of the film, you can tell that you're in for the time of your life. To put it shortly, Bill Condon (director-writer) delivers the goods with this film. It's most definitely the first of its kind. It moves at a rapturous pace that leaves you breathless and delivers performances that are both subtle and fittingly over the top.",2006
9,"I saw a preview screening of Dreamgirls on Nov. 15. and have to say I was pretty blown away by it. I can always tell when a movie really hits me because the thought immediately runs through my head, ""Wow, I can't wait to OWN this on DVD."" Needless to say, Dreamgirls is now at the top of my ""To Buy"" list.",2006
10,"The pumped up beats, the glamorous outfits, and that Motown sound - YEAH! Something which the film industry's been waiting for since Chicago won a Best Picture Nod at the Oscars in 2002.",2007
1,I'm an old guy who was around in the 50's and 60's when they were cranking out those stock rock 'n roll biz movies. I've seen this movie a dozen times before. Dreamgirls has the clich√©d characters and the predictable paper thin plot that were characteristic of the genre. Even in the context of that genre Dreamgirls doesn't make the grade because it has an instantly forgettable soundtrack.,2007
10,"The movie was excellent. I saw it last night and Jennifer Hudson got plenty of cheers and claps all through out the movie. The whole first half of the movie you forget that Beyonce is even in it. Don't get me wrong she does a great job too. Eddie Murphy was also very spectacular. It was good to see him in a film of this caliber again. There are great songs and the movie is aesthetically beautiful to the eyes. There are a number of great actors and actresses in the movie as well and I hope after their performance in Dreamgirls they get more work in the industry. Jennifer Hudson really shines in this movie, she definitely deserves to win any and all awards she is nominated for. PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",2006
1,Yeah. Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Supremes.,2007
1,"Yes there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film.",2007
1,"I grew up in this age, I loved the music, it was part of my life. This movie creates an ugly caricature of that time and sound. The music doesn't sound anything like the real music of that era: it sounds like a misguided and failed attempt to make the music of that era sound like the current sounds. The story lines and (especially) the characters spontaneously bursting out in song are pathetic and false. I find it utterly, utterly incomprehensible why bona fide stars like Jennifer Hudson, Eddy Murphy, and Jamie Foxx would want to have anything to do with this piece of junk, and completely stunning why this movie won any awards! The acting is bad, the singing is bad, the script was called in by a screenwriter with a hangover on his/her way to a custody settlement hearing. This movie was offensively awful. YECH!",2007
8,"It's a crowd-pleaser all right, and I usually object to those. But I have to say, this member of the crowd was rather pleased with the film. It's nothing deep, I'll say right off the bat. It's no cinematic masterpiece that will be a beacon for films to come. What it is, however, is an absolute ball. It's the only film I think I've ever seen that really captures the experience of seeing a great musical in the theater. It's fun, it's rousing, and it just made me feel good. The music is outstanding and surprisingly comes off as stuff that might really have been recorded during the eras depicted, with maybe just the right tinge of Broadway to them. The vocal performances are just outstanding. Of course by now everyone knows the standout is Jennifer Hudson, who will be unstoppable at the Oscars this year. Her acting is quite good, but she'll win it for the singing. I would also be perfectly happy to see Eddie Murphy take home a statuette. He's excellent in both comedic and dramatic moments. Much of the rest of the cast is good, too, including Beyonc√© Knowles and Anika Noni Rose. The story is of course based on that of the Supremes, and in that way, I felt a little Susan Alexander Kane / Marion Davies situation going on with Deena Jones / Diana Ross. While the Dreams are supposed to be only like the Supremes, the film kind of does imply that Ross was not an extremely talented singer, which is of course patently false. Anyway, small quibble. No, Dreamgirls is no masterpiece, but I like it about as much as I liked Chicago, probably a tad more, and I wouldn't be too ticked off if the Academy went with it for Best Picture. I do prefer it slightly to The Departed. I just don't think Scorsese's fourth best movie about organized crime should be crowned. Definitely recommended, as long as you know what you're getting into.",2007
1,"It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it's all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. I can't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. A bunch of songs does not a movie make.",2006
2,"This was longer than the Ten Commandments, All Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined. My oh My, what a nightmare. This is the single biggest over-hype of 2006. THere is not a moment that is not scripted and clich√©d. Movie Musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture, in the form of endless music montages, shoddy acting, and poor directing choices (Seriously, Mr. Condon, did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots? It's at #58! No wait, look its rising up the charts and here is the passing Billboard notice to show you again....and again....and again)",2006
3,"I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. The film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.",2007
10,"Saw the preview last night of Dreamgirls in Charlotte, NC. First off I have to say that it is a great interpretation of the stage play. I thought that the script had really fleshed out the show and brought to life ideas that were only briefly touched upon. All of the characters were much more believable on screen, and the added songs really fit in with the rest of the score. The greatest triumph of this movie has to be Jennifer Hudson as Effie. She is truly a star. After she sang, And Im Telling You, the whole audience burst into applause. It was truly magical. I turned to the friend who went with me and said...she definitely will be nominated if not win the Oscar!!!",2006
4,Dreamgirls is a perfect example of why I hate most musicals. Just when there is a poignant dramatic point in the movie...mofos burst into song. That is just not the way human beings behave. The gattdam singing ruins it for me every time. They needed to limit the songs to when the girls were actually performing on stage.,2007
2,"First of all, the ads are misleading. This is not a simple rags to riches story drama. This is a big, over the top musical. Lines are often sung instead of spoken, and compared to other musicals of our time, such as Phantom of the Opera, this one unfortunately feels and views as a play; flat and rather amateurish characters and directing made this rather reminiscent of a paltry made-for-TV biography of the Supremes. With a poor semblance of plot, cringe-worthy overacting by all leads at some point and a running time at least a half hour too long, this movie is by far one of the biggest movie disappointments in recent memory. What I will say in praise of this film is that while she's not exactly Oscar-worthy yet; Jennifer Hudson is most definitely one of the best singers that I can recall in recent memory and her performance was the strongest in the film.",2007
1,"It's hard to find enough bad things to say about this ""movie."" As everyone knows, there's only one reason to see it: American ""Idol's"" Jennifer Hudson. She is spectacular, though she sticks out like a sore butt. Like her talented and capable co-stars, especially Eddie Murphy, she is mired in a pretentious, overlong, shallow, predictable, inept, amateurish script and saddled with a director who might as well have submitted this as a 7th grade school project using the latest free editing software. The movie is lifted from the show; no attempts to make it cinematic were made other than to use old news footage and every editing and directing clich√© you can imagine. Songs are seen both as staged performances and as impromptu on-the spot dramatic statements within-the-film. The music, though although everyone must have known this, is unforgivably boring, repetitive, hokey, Broadway Deli Cheesecake, screamy garbage, and is an insult to everything that Motown, Diana Ross, the Supremes, Berry Gordy, James Brown and everyone else who lifted music out of the kitschy crap celebrated in this film (with one or two weak exceptions)tried to do. Bill Condon should be banned from Hollywood forever; the writers of Dreamgirls should be boiled in a vat of collard greens.The cinematography is non-existenct, as if the lens were filtered through the girls' outrageous, oily wigs.",2006

6,"You have to put this movie into perspective! I enjoyed it but it was not until later that I realized that it was not that good! It entertains and that is about it! Well some people may say what more do you expect! Well I suppose I wanted the film to be more than it really is. Then again I also wanted the score to be bigger and better than what it was! The story line is OK and does refer to the Supremes story as we all know... However, the music apart from the ""BIG"" number is boring. I bought the CD and played it twice and got bored! I immediately listen to Wicked and what a major difference! Now that is what you call a great score! The greatest thing about this movie is Jennifer Hudson! She is perfect for the part and she does a great job with her acting. Also she gives a great performance of a really great song. Everyone knows she was under pressure to reach the levels of Jennifer Holiday and I think she did a good job. However, its was her acting ability that pulled it off.",2007
8,"Life, unlike bad movies, is seldom obvious. In life, murderous dictators don't appear - especially at first - as mustache-twirling Snidley Whiplash figures, cackling madly (although Mussolini came close). The scary truth about monsters is that they are three-dimensional beings, not cardboard cutouts, who just kill a lot of people, but otherwise put their pants on one leg at a time, like you and I, and that makes them so much scarier than if they came from another planet.",2006
8,"Forest Whitaker's ferociously charismatic turn as Idi Amin so dominates this intense historical fiction that it is honestly difficult to pay attention to anything else in this 2006 political thriller. Even though he is definitively the emotional locus, he is intriguingly not the protagonist of the story. That role belongs to young James McAvoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, a precocious Scottish doctor who ventures to Uganda to satisfy his need for adventure after graduating medical school. By happenstance, Garrigan is called upon to help Amin with a minor sprain after his private car plows into a cow. Impressed by the young man's lack of hesitancy to take action, Amin appoints Garrigan to be his personal physician, a post that seduces the impressed doctor into the Ugandan dictator's political inner circle and extravagant lifestyle.",2007
9,"How can an actor terrify you without saying a word, without even hardly moving his face or body? I'm not sure how he does it, but Mr. Whitaker does it over and over again in this movie. And then he turns around the next minute and becomes giant hug-able teddy bear superhero. Forget all the others, this is the best horror film of the year. This movie, and his performance in particular, grab hold of you and never let go. Whitaker should win an Oscar for best actor, I've never seen a better performance in my life. Also notable is the Nicholas Garrigan character who is written and acted very skilfully to draw the (non-African) spectator into the world of Uganda and Amin. The way his character willingly ""falls into"" Amin's web of charisma somehow goes a long way toward mitigating the racist potential of a story about a very troubled (African black) man. The way the interplay of the two lead character's cultural backgrounds plays out on screen moves the story beyond just their personalities and into the realm of incisive socio-political analysis and critique. This movie is quite incredible, really.",2006
9,"There have been so few pictures this year that are standouts. This movie is one of them. Much of what you will see is true, and did occur in Uganda's history. Amin's doctor, played by James Macavoy, is the main fiction in the movie, but one would think they are watching a historical event. Macavoy's character is so real. The doctor grows from a free thinking, adventure loving, womanizer, to a scared, concerned, and enlightened person. The viewer watches through Macavoys eyes as he witnesses the horrors of Amin's (Forest Whitaker's) presidency and regime.",2006

Amin had served in the British army and developed an admiration for the Scots.

2,"Before I begin, I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including Whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination. It is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION, it is a very good movie. For that, I give it the two stars.",2007
4,"Forest Whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. ""Historical fiction"" does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.",2007

10,"2007 has already started off with a magnificent bang in my eyes. Last year, 2006, started with more the after shock of three decent fantasy epics, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and King Kong. 2006 actually didn't really begin with any redeeming movies at all to be honest, however 2007 has got off to a spectacular start. I've so far only seen three movies. Now out of the three The Last King of Scotland is easily the best, however by saying this I realise how much of an understatement this is for this movie. You see The Last King of Scotland is not only better than these other two movies combined, hell its not only better than most of my favourite movies of last year, this movie is easily one of the best movies in absolutely ages! In fact I can only put this on the same level as Pan's Labyrinth as this movie is absolutely spectacular! In fact there has never been an early front runner in my eyes for Film of the Year, however this movie looks very likely to prove everyone different! The Last King of Scotland is an interesting movie following the story of a young man called Nicholas as he is propelled into the bizarre world of Ugandan leader Idi Amin. The movie might not be entirely based on reality, there's some stuff that never occurred, however this movie does still manage to be an absolutely thrilling event and featuring one of the most powerful performances in ages. Forrest Whittaker is absolutely breathtaking as the Ugandan leader, Idi Amin. In fact if he does not win the Best Actor Oscar he will have been brutally robbed. The movies also works because it is a nice blend of thriller, comedy (on the rare occasion) and also complete and utter tragedy. Its a movie bound to please the critics and come Awards time will hopefully reap the benefits. A well crafted and a beautifully acted movie that I now absolutely adore.",2007

The Last King Of Scotland is suppose to be about Idi Amin, dictator of Uganda in to '70s, charismatic yet sick in the head.

In fact, all of the actor's performances were terrific. The shooting locations were beautiful. There was a lot of suspense in the film and at times I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene. I must admit the story was really good. There were absolutely wonderful camera shots and angles. THE BAD: Gratuitous sex and violence. Say what you will about Alfred Hitchcock being from another era in film making, but his ideas about implied violence and sex in most of his films were good ones. THE UGLY: I would have enjoyed the film a lot more if it had been told from the POV of Idi Amin, one of his wives or a Ugandan in his cabinet. CONCLUSION: Would I pay to see this film? Yes.

If you enjoyed the first film in the series, or (as one of the uninitiated) these tantalising glimpses of high-tech goth makes it appeal, then read on - for the more you know about the mythology first the better (since the film itself wastes little time explaining itself).",2006
8,"Selene (Kate Beckinsale) wishes to expose the truth about the death of Viktor to the first true vampire Marcus (Tony Curran) that is hibernating. However, Marcus has already awakened and wants to release his savage Lycan brother William (Brian Steele), who has been imprisoned for centuries. When Marcus tries to get the medal possessed by Lucian from the hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman), Selene decides to visit Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), the exiled official historian of the covens, to understand his interest. When Selene and Michael meet Tanis, they disclose the truth about their bloodlines, and later with the support of Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), Selene faces the powerful and evil Marcus as the last hope left for the mankind.",2006
8,"Let's face it. If you're going to see this movie, you probably enjoyed the original and are looking for more. You want high doses of fight scenes, vampire and lycan lore, blood, violence, and Kate Beckinsale wearing leather or less. In short, this movie delivers all of the above in great excess, so if you liked Underworld, you're going to like Underworld: Evolution as much or more.",2006

1,"The first film was like bread, y'know edible. This one's just plain crap and half of it makes no sense. Michael dies halfway through and, because he's a hybrid, resurrects himself. If they want to kill him off, just do it and be done. Also Marcus' death could have been much better instead of him just getting chopped up. The same applies to William. How can he die so easily. It's just plain stupid. Lucian was a much better villain, you actually felt for him. If there's going to bea sequel then the producers have got to stop relying on Kate Beckinsdale to sell the film and actually put some substance or at least some decently choreographed fight scenes in there.",2006

4,"Everything is made of fast action stuff that the story loses its strength and originality, and you find yourself in an action movie lacking the thrill that was one of the best points of Underworld 1. And the big disaster is the ending, with William out from his prison we expected the movie was warming up, but instead, a fast action scene where Micheal somehow after being dead gets back to life, and beheads William in a couple of minutes. same for the short fight between Selene and Marcus. At that point the movie was sooooo disappointing.",2006
1,"What could you expect from a movie, which starts with a quote from the horrible Matrix (R)Evolution(S), as the best character of Underworld 1 warns out ""It ends tonight""? All that was intriguing, genuine, attractive in the first movie has been thrown out in the garbage can. A movie is essentially a story. A good sequel is a movie where you tell different things in the same way, where moviegoers get the same feelings but in a different way. If you bump off in the first 20 min. all the characters who had survived form part one (Kraven, the blond vampire-woman and all the Covent) that's fair evidence that you think a plot is made by a collection of fight scenes, plus some cheesy nudity and new characters, their only purpose being to be slaughtered. Corvinus and Tanis could bring something interesting in the move, but they are vapid, shallow and lifeless even before they get killed. Actually Corvinus was really not needed, unless it would become a major figure of the movie, not a self-murdering 700 year old loser. A real waste. Not mentioning the flaws of continuity, logic, and lore tradition (this is about how vamp and werewolves can be killed). Common sense is also sorely lacking in the movie, especially when we have been told by many movies how helicopters crash... by the way¬Ö why Marcus ¬ñ after supposedly having been resurrected many times in the past centuries ¬ñ got just now the urge to free his brother? The film is an insult to fans of Underworld and a not recommendable one for those who are not in the genre.",2006

There are so many reasons that this movie sucked that I forget more than half of them.

They also did a great job in out-doing the killings from part1! I was so intrigued by this movie I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first twenty minutes :) . The director did a great job of bringing you into his ""underworld"". Every part of the story line was pleasantly unexpected. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part of this story anymore. It isn't mostly centered on love like the first one, however it is all there, from love, to the long history, to time jumping. ",2006
1,"As a fan of the first movie, this was a absolute and utter disappointment. I was skeptical when I first heard about a sequel, and now it seems that when Kevin Grevioux disappeared from the project without any form of explanation, so went all the chances it had of being good. I truly wanted to enjoy this movie, and envy those who can, but there were just too many faults here for me to look past. ",2006
9,"What can someone write about a movie that has been so well discussed already during the past weeks?! Everything has been said in reviews and fan forums about the plot with Romeo & Juliet resemblances framed by the secret war between vampires and werewolves, about the cast and characters, about the movie's style & atmosphere, action, make-up and CGI effects, camera shots, violence, love scenes & nudity. Underworld Evolution's predecessor was above all underestimated in terms of what potential it had to build up a solid fan base in a genre that throughout movie history like no other has not only drawn people into the theatres but also to conventions, fan clubs, signings and other events. If we go back in time movies which threw together famous film monsters like in ""House of Frankenstein"", ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man"", later in ""Frankenstein's Bloody Terror"" or in our days ""Freddie Vs. Jason"", ""Van Helsing"" and ""Aliens Vs Predator"" were most likely designed to squeeze the purse of the audience (which in most cases without no doubt they successfully did) but never have withstood the moviegoer's expectations for a long time. ""Underworld"" (2003) on the other hand, a sleeper during it's theatrical release as treated with neglect promotion wise in many countries has to be admitted that it rightfully gained it's respect through mouth-to-mouth propaganda resulting in DVD sales which soon exceeded the box-office results. The movie built up a very solid fan base, people that keep talking about it even after three years ¬ñ creating an under-world (sorry for the pun, I just could not resist) like Star Trek, Star Wars and some other Sci-Fi movies and shows have done before. So it is very possible that for the first time in the horror genre ""Underworld"" and ""Underworld Evolution"" really work as 'monster mash' movies.",2006

It's no doubt that Underworld would have a sequel, since it was obviously hinted at after the end credits of the original, though it would be three years before it materialized.",2006
6,"OK sequel to UNDERWORLD will appeal to its core audience and few others. Too many flashbacks to the first movie do little to explain what is going on in the sequel -- that is, to the uninitiated and people like myself who hasn't seen the original in awhile. The plot is thin, although the action is fast and furious as vampire/warrior Kate Beckinsale is again on the track of those who threaten to destroy the world. Good-looking nonactor Scott Speedman is back as her love interest, himself a combination of vampire and werewolf who is virtually indestructible. And knowing this takes away some of the fun toward the end when the big fight is on and the chips are really down. But enough said about that. Beckinsale looks great in skin-tight black leather, and has a quasi-nude love scene with Speedman. The gore quotient is fully realized, thankfully. The monsters are great-looking, and the atmospheric photography and sets are first rate. Nevertheless, recommended only for fans of the first.",2006

1,"Ah, another weekend, another mindless badly written action film crapfest. Granted, I saw the first movie, which I hated, so the odds of my liking the second film were about zero. But nothing could have prepared me for the abomination which I was forced to witness. I think the basic premise is kind of interesting.. vampires versus lycanthropes. The first thing that caught my eye was a rather sensual moment half way through the movie. With scene after scene of senseless gore and the usual 40,000 round clips being emptied into the main characters with little result, you'd think a love scene would be welcomed. Boy was I wrong. This was no love scene... this was flat out monkeysex. Usually the camera stays tastefully above the waist.. not here my friends! You might think this sounds sexy, but it wasn't. You see, they showed naught one bit of the girl, but plenty of man-ass gyrating between two deathly pale vampire legs. Imagine the host of Tales from the Crypt taking a shower... yeah it was about that sexy. And then half way through the movie came my favorite scene of all. The girl tells her lycanthrope friend ""drink this blood, otherwise the hunger will strike and you might attack a human without warning"". So what does he do? He doesn't drink the blood, and decides to go hang out at the nearby tavern. Well gee, I wonder what's about to happen? When will Hollywood realize that we want heroes that are not complete dips****. Anyhow yeah.. next thing you know hes tossing humans around like rag dolls and running away from a swarm of cops. The rest of the movie consisted of the male lycan having trouble killing the lowliest of werewolves one second and taking on the super-powerful lord of the vampires with ease the next. But that's not all folks, they saved the worst for last. The whole plot of the movie is that the bad vampire is trying to release his SUPER powerful lycanthrope brother from a prison, and the heroes must stop him because this lycanthrope incredible super-villain. Well at the end of the movie the super werewolf is in fact released, and we see it for I don't know about five SECONDS before the hero rips it's head off. Oh yes, you heard me. They didn't even SHOW his fight with the plot-line defining character. They actually just used a quick cut away from the female hero shooting things to show just the part where the beasts head is being torn off. Wow, good thing they went through all that work keeping him from being released. I'd be surprised if that werewolf could have even left the castle without a rascal scooter. I bet he was all white because he was old and tired, not super powerful. They should have taken him to a nursing home and fed him the werewolf version of Ensure. Although I guess if you think about it, the fact that they ripped the head off a poor defenseless old werewolf was the most interesting part of the whole movie.",2006

The characters are very interesting, but we get around the same run time to develop the characters and so I somewhat lose interest. Michael Corvin still isn't that great of a character but he has more to do in this one and he comes off as okay. The awesome Kate Beckinsale is back and continues play the role quite well. Markus (Tony Curran) has a great look to him and he's a great antagonist although I can't say he has the presence of the great Bill Nighy. His brother is a great looking werewolf but he's a mindless monster so his threat is somewhat limited from my perspective. The decision makes him a lackluster villain who spills plenty of blood but nothing else.",2011

Myself, I was mostly moaning, wishing I had sat closer to an aisle or an exit. And I actually went into this film expecting to like it......The script is incomprehensible and illogical. I realize this is ""meant"" to be a fable, but it's mostly the director --- who mugs his way through a key role in his own film, getting his own good side most of the time --- who's really out to lecture us. In passing, we get a middle class housing project in ""Philadelphia"" which seems to be situated with suburbs on one side and a national wildlife preserve on the other. We meet a mythical beast which looks like a crocadoggy, which appears at a building wide party but no one notices. Paul Giammati, who wears glasses in the film, manages what seems to be a hyper-athletic underwater dive without glasses or goggles that would have taxed an experience scuba diver. A film critic gets torn apart by the monster in a building corridor but no one notices (is M-Night suggesting something here?) and there is a really nasty racial sterotype of an Asian girl, a ""college student,"" who speaks we-all-sound-same funny-rice-girl English. Uh, why funny accent for Asian girl, Mr. Filmmaker, when Indian-American film director-actor talk so good? Funny accent no essential to plot, so why include, hey?

1,"This is my first time reviewing a movie, but I thought I had too because there is no way I can get the couple hours of my life back I wasted watching this movie. To me, the rest of my party, and apparently the entire audience, there was no point to this movie. I thought the general idea was good, but there was absolutely no plot to it. The movie is a fantasy, but at least the human elements of the movie could have been realistic. First off, every character in this movie seems to believe everything they are told. IF some guy came up to me and started rambling on and on about a ""narf"" I would laugh in his face. Yet, he doesn't even have to work to get people to help him out with whatever he is trying to do with this woman. Then watching a group of 35-50 year olds party like they were at a fraternity keg party was priceless. Weird beasts are running around outside that are covered in grass (another thing that had me laughing) and yet nobody seems to notice. Eventually the narf is saved and the grass covered wolf thing is beaten up by grass covered monkeys and an eagle comes to get the woman. Then it just ends. You don't see where the woman goes, you don't see what happens to anyone else for that matter. I wish I could let myself believe a bed time story from somebody in order to try to save some strange woman whom we never find out why she needs to be saved. At least I stuck it out and watched it until it ended, which I can not say for half of the audience. This is the first movie I have ever been to where half of the people just got up and left because it was that bad. It made no sense to me.

9,"A moment that may have felt like surrender to Elizabeth II is the most moving and powerful moment in a film filled with moving and powerful moments. Helen Mirren works a miracle with her characterization. When the Queen is forced by circumstances to address her people and mourn in public Diana's death, Helen Mirren doesn't forget that her character is a seasoned public speaker but not an actress. When she delivers her speech to her subjects, the real strength is in her commitment to her duty and not the meaning of her words. It is a chilling, masterful acting stroke. Stephen Frears uses the brilliantly structured script to reveal something that's always being in front of our eyes but we've never seen. The privacy of the most public people in the world. Michael Sheen is terrific as Blair and every piece of casting is truly inspired but it's Helen Mirren's film, oh yeah, one hundred per cent.",2007
9,"Let's start by saying that the film itself is a perfect reflection of the days we live in. A deep human drama with a tabloid sensibility. A tradition that's lasted over a thousand years shaken by a world who demands public spectacle. Humbleness or humiliation? Asks Queen Elizabeth to her Prime Minister. Talk Show audiences wouldn't know the difference and we are all, one way or another, talk show audiences. From Jerry Springer to Oprah Winfrey. How did it really feel like? We all want to know, we all want to see the sorrow, the confession or the denial on the catch of the day's face. Michael Sheen is a adorable, yes I think adorable is the right word, as Tony Blair, the labor link between the people and the monarchy. Helen McCrory as Mrs Blair is another standout. Just look at her walking backwards trying to to be true to royal protocol. I had to adjust to the fact that the Queen Mother was played by Sylvia Syms. Sylvia Syms! Queen Mom, a wonderful old battleship who's seen it all and fought her entire life for things to change so they could stay the same. It is however Helen Mirren, in a performance that could only be described as miraculous, that takes us body and soul through the painful ordeal of those seven days surrounding the death of Princess Diana, the ""people's princess"" a natural master in a world of tabloids and self humiliation disguised as humbleness. Helen Mirren gives us more than a glimpse into the hermetic heart of a living queen. Not a single false note, not a single cheap shot. A performance that is as poignant as it is entertaining. I was as besotted with Helen's Queen as her Labor Prime Minister was. I can't wait to meet her again.",2006
9,"It was Meryl Streep no less to call Helen Mirren ""an acting God"" and she wasn't kidding. I saw ""The Queen"" again last night, a year after the hype, the awards and the masses of superlatives thrown Helen Mirren's way and you know what? It was all richly deserved. Her performance got an extra something along the year and I believe it will continue to grow like most wonderful true things. Helen Mirren is not an actress who ""dissappears"" behind a character , no, she is in total control and that's what makes her creation so moving. The illusion is fueled by her own conviction - the character's as well as the actress's. Last night I wondered, during the Queen and her Prime Minister's walk, how did the real Elizabeth II reacted to this portrait. I'm sure she's seen it and I'm sure that she must agree that nobody could have done it better or more fairly.",2007
9,"I saw her Elizabeth I not so long ago and I was bowled over by her fearlessness, I was moved, transported, amused. Now, Elizabeth II, the living Queen. Helen Mirren accomplishes the impossible. She lets us know the Queen, her Queen, without passing judgment. Just being her. I found myself understanding her dilemma in human terms. Something that she had done so brilliantly with Elizabeth I, she humanized her or rather she allows us to find the human creature behind the iconic fa√ßade. The difficulty of not falling into a caricature or a simple impersonation may have seemed insurmountable but here she is. Perfect, real, extraordinary. Long Live Helen Mirren!",2006
10,"It's still early innings, but Stephen Frears's The Queen is definitely going on my short list for best film of the year, and it will stay there. It's a flawless, burnished production, a virtually perfect film. This glowing, suspenseful docudrama retells the story of the days of upheaval in London and elsewhere, in 1997, shortly after Tony Blair had just won for Labor, by steering clear of trades unions and welfare statism, while flogging his ""let's modernize Britain"" program, window-dressing for his Clinton-like political shift to the right.",2006
10,"Everything, really utterly and completely everything in that movie, from the performance of the exquisite leading lady down to the smallest word or movement was perfect. There isn't a single flaw in it, not one, not a single one. I was a bit tired while watching it, but still that movie held me mesmerized to the screen all through it. Helen Mirren brought to life a Queen Elizabeth II that I would have never expected, and the outstanding performances of Michael Sheen as Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Philip (and the entire supporting cast) only made everything that much better. I will be the first to admit that I respected the British people for managing to uphold this wonderful ages-old tradition in today's modern world, and if I were British, I guess I would have shared in their royalist pride (although I do wish you could go to London and bring back souvenirs that didn't necessarily have a monarch's face plastered allover them). But I remember when Diana died, I was one of those ignorant people (yes, after that movie especially, that's the word I would use) who were bullying the queen for her lack of emotional display. This movie set right certain things that have been bothering me for quite some time whenever I thought back to what I was like at the time. It put many things into an entirely different perspective (not nearly all of which having to do with Lady Diana's death). But most of all, it stripped the queen of her ice before my eyes, and revealed a human being that ironically enough, the movie also made me understand why I did not see before. To top it all, there is the wonderfully tactful and flowing dialogue, and the mesmerizing performances of Cromwell and Sheen at both her sides. The movie, just as its leading lady, flows gracefully, with quiet dignity and respect, and captures the audience's hearts in the way we would least expect. I almost cried several times throughout the movie, and the memory of Diana was only one of the reasons; the Queen was the other. I also have to salute the cinematography in this film, especially sequences the likes of the one that led up to Diana's death, which was brilliant, as well as the various combinations between original and archive footage. So in a nutshell, my verdict? An absolute must-see, regardless of whether you're a ""fan"" of Her Majesty or of Lady Diana or neither. Go see this movie, it will change the way you see so many things in your life, I promise that much. I guarantee it. And if Oscars were still being given out to people who deserved them¬Ö but we all know that's wishful thinking. Let's just say that Helen Mirren deserved much more than 5 minutes of standing ovation. I know it's strange coming from me (or anyone), but I believe the Queen herself, if she is in fact anything like the Queen portrayed by Mirren, would have been very proud of this movie.",2006

That's why it's amazing to realize that the Queen didn't quite understand that and how powerful and moving her surrendering to the fact. I don't know how to describe Helen Mirren's portrayal but I'm tempted to say already (I only saw the film last night) that is among the best I've ever seen. Riveting, totally fulfilling. The illusion is complete and without mockery or mimicry Helen Mirren gives us a full picture of someone who only exists in our minds as a title and in a series of constantly repeating images - hats, smiles, hand waves and holiday greetings from a TV screen - Congratulations to everyone concerned. A total triumph.",2006
10,"THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content. Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona. But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times. It is a staggering achievement.",2006
8,"On the 1st of September 1997, the world saw tragedy. In the turmoil that followed, Princess Diana's death was blamed on the Media, the driver, and an entire array of others, before the upset and ill-meant malaise of the public was turned sneeringly to the Royal Family. In this film, we get a glimpse of what life was like inside Buckingham Palace, and whether The Queen (played here by Helen Mirren) was being cold and uncaring, or, if she was the one who was suffering most of all.",2006
9,"Stephen Frears' The Queen, written by Peter Morgan (co-author of The Last King of Scotland) and starring Helen Mirren, is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy about the week in late summer, 1997, when Tony Blair, fresh in office as new-Liberal Prime Minister, ""saved"" the British royal family, or saved it from itself, when Lady Di died in Paris. Partly the Queen, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, loathed Diana for what she had done to them, which the public, conditioned by the mass media to adore her, could not know about. Partly the Queen wanted to shelter the boys, Diana's sons, from the noise of publicity, which would only aggravate their grief. Partly, and perhaps most of all, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip. But also as Peter French has said about this film, the royal family ""are shown to be morally and socially blinkered."" Tony Blair reluctantly taught the Queen to see their absence of public response to the death, her insistence at first that it was a ""private, family matte,"" was a disastrous policy that had to be reversed.",2006
10,"What an amazing Film; Mirren should get an Oscar and Blair was brilliantly portrayed too but best of all was the cinematography - the highlands, the stag - transcendental and wonderfully conceived and executed. Best film I've seen in ages. It perfectly portrayed the balance between the traditionalist monarchy on the one hand and the new modernising labour government on the other. The dialogue between the main protagonists was excellent and there were also some wonderful one-liners; ""tell him to hang on"" in reference to a 'phone call from Gordon Brown was the one I enjoyed the best. All the royals were well portrayed and it was a nice touch keeping the princes, William + Harry hidden from view.",2006
10,"I saw this film on September 25th, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""¬Öexplores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.",2006
8,"There is no way of knowing, of course, just how authentic is Peter Morgan's very fine script for this account of what may or may not have taken place in the household of HRH during the days, chiefly between the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and her funeral, as it is unlikely that those involved would have blurted out to Morgan what they probably consider to be state secrets. No, Morgan's script is pure conjecture, a fiction about real events lent a considerable degree of seeming 'authenticity' by director Stephen Frears handling of the material and use of documentary footage mainly taken from the television programmes of the day. Should we condemn him, then, for guessing what conversations may have occurred in private between the Queen and her Prime Minister? Certainly not, anymore than we should condemn James Goldman for being fanciful as to what may or may not have occurred in the Court of Henry 11 and Eleanor of Aquitaine.",2006
6,"I have never been a particular fan of the Royals, nor indeed of the monarchy itself. I also felt the mass hysteria that overloaded and in many ways out shone Princess Diana's death was of the most hypocritical kind in regards to a guilty media, and outrageously superfluous on behalf of a needy public. Yes, that week was truly a memorable one if you lived in Britain and owned a television set because you couldn't fail to be engulfed in the bleeding heart hysteria that followed on from Diana's untimely demise. ",2007
8,"The paparazzi kissed the princess that fateful week in 1997, but all the English people wanted was their Queen. Stephen Frears' competent, well written, expertly cast and intimate look into the Royal Family and British government in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death is a straightforward, no-nonsense stunner.",2006
10,"i've had a few days to think about THE QUEEN, and i say without shame that this is a perfectly constructed film with the necessary bonus of a great ensemble cast. This has got to be the great, Helen Mirren's year, in spite of everything. She has now recreated both ElizabethR's, and does it like nobody else. Watching the solid and versatile James Cromwell playing her idiot, cousin-husband was also very good; and i mean no offense to staunch royalists. British history and particularly it's ancient monarchy is one of my passions, so i waited for the films' release with anticipation. It was a true treat seeing Ms Sylvia Syms playing the queen mum. There are brief comments made about the royal family which are less than complimentary but true. But Mr Frears doesn't dwell on them, points out Elizabeth's devotion to her country and to her tradition, without hitting us over the head with it. I loved his film, THE GRIFTERS. THE QUEEN is equally as good. Some of my fellow film fans feel that the magnificent stag, so relentlessly hunted for it's fourteen points, represented Diana. For me, it represented the entire royal family, and especially the Queen. I loved the opening quotation assessed to Henry 4, who basically usurped the throne from family with a better claim: ""uneasy is the head that wears the crown"", or something close to that, For him, it was. But he did his fair share of back stabbing himself to retain power. The scene with Helen and Sylvia consulting about what to do was especially powerful. it's quite true that Elizabeth is descended from a long, unbroken line which precedes the Norman conquest. As queen, she has, imo, done everything she can and more to fulfill her obligations and her birth right, putting her country before anything else. The weak and ineffectual Charles wasn't man enough to marry the woman he loved. Some may argue that he was doing ""his duty"", but if he was, he destroyed a few lives along the way. And i do believe that yes indeed, he would let his mother take a bullet for him. Not nice to say, and perhaps a tad unfair. Elizabeth, on the other hand, threatened to abdicate as heir presumptive if she couldn't marry Phillip. Then there are the references to George the sixth's demise, from the stress of being King when he wasn't up to it, nor groomed for it. Well, other Kings had older brothers die,such as his own father; one was even passed over in favour of a younger one; others seized it. I think his excessive smoking and depleted immune system from generations of cousin-marrying probably didn't help, since he died from emphysema. or so we're told. But i admired him, and i adored his wife, the late Queen Consort Elizabeth. Don't get me wrong; i really feel no moral criticism about cousins marrying; but i do believe in hybrid vitality. And then there's the Hapsburgs! Her relationship with Tony Blair was believable and quite likely very close to the truth. I do believe i recently watched Mr. Sheen portray the insane emperor Nero... This is a glorious, tasteful film with an unbelievable performance by Helen Mirren. It may not be everybody's ""cup of tea"", but it is a gem. *I wish i could have had a better look at those portraits hanging behind The Queen. There were her grandparents, her great grandparents, and Victoria, i believe, who was her great great great grandmother...spectacular collection of art and portraits...some were cut off at the waist, headless..like that magnificent stag....",2006
9,"I'm impressed. The movie is good, and truthful. I'm not to judge how close to the truth were Balmoral scenes, but behavior of public and tabloids was perfectly recreated.",2006
7,"At the time of Princess Diana's funeral I remember thinking that, instead of rewriting ""Candle in the Wind"", Elton John should simply have performed a song from ""Evita""- the one that asks the questions ""Why all this howling hysterical sorrow? What kind of goddess has lived among us? How will we ever get by without her?"" Tim Rice's lyrics were, of course, originally written about Eva Peron, but they could equally well have been written about the British public's over-reaction to Diana's death.",2006
6,"The film is focused entirely on the period of Princess Diana's death and the period upto the funeral a week later. In common with most people from the UK that is something that is very much etched in the memory, so the film does very little in terms of information. I can certainly vouch for it's accuracy although the reaction does seem a little over the top in retrospect.",2007
8,"In 1997, after the death of Lady Di in a car accident in Paris, the reluctant Queen (Helen Mirren) and The Establishment do not accept to honor the ""People's Princess"" as a member of the Royal Family. However, the public and the media question the utility of the monarchy and the just-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) advises the Queen to make a public speech mourning the loss of Diana.",2008
2,I'm very worried that some people might think this movie is a faithful depiction of recent history.,2006
8,"Imagine for a moment you are newly elected landslide Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and your modernising beliefs don't really welcome obeisance to an outdated monarchy. Princess Diana dies, and the nation turns with venomous tooth and claw (aided perhaps by a certain spin doctor) against the Royals. A golden opportunity? But Blair feels there is something unseemly about tearing the Queen to bits and, in the middle of the crisis, kicks in some damage control.",2006
10,"I was lucky enough to attend the first UK screening of Shane Meadows' latest offering, THIS IS ENGLAND, last Tuesday at the London Film Festival. Having been a fan of Meadows' work since seeing TWENTYFOURSEVEN in 1998, I have anticipated each of his new films with excitement and great interest. Meadows' films defy categorisation and always exceed expectation, as anyone who has seen A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS or DEAD MAN'S SHOES will attest. THIS IS ENGLAND had a lot to live up to¬Ö ",2006
10,"I just saw ""This Is England"" at the Berlin Film Festival where it was screened in the section ""Generation 14P"". This section is an extension of the former ""Kinderfilmfest"" for teenagers between 14 and 18 - dealing with more mature issues.",2007
8,There is no doubt that this film is a truly great piece of film-making. Shane Meadows crafts films in the same style as Martin Scorcese. We are given a glimpse into the lifestyle of a group of characters over a short period of time. It is very much a fly on the wall type of movie. The point of these films is to understand the actions of the characters rather than judging their actions. I have no doubt that there will be some people that tag this film as being racist which is rather missing the point.,2007
10,"Fellow Midlander Shane Meadows has produced not only his finest work to date but one of the very best films to come out of Britain that I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Just as the effectively chilling, bloody (yet arguably flawed) ""Dead Man's Shoes"" showcased a passionate return to low budget, focused film making, ""This Is England"" sees him perfect his technique. It is a seemingly effortless achievement that matches a warm, humorous portrayal of a young lad growing up with his experience of the cold brutality that came with the 80s skinhead culture. The way in which Shane blends these two aspects together without compromising on either is most impressive.",2006
8,"After the success of 'Dead Man's Shoes' local filmmaker Shane Meadows returns with 'This is England' a story of absence and isolation, belonging and the power of persuasion. Set in 1983 with a backdrop of the war in the Falklands the film opens with a montage of relevant images everything from Maggie Thatcher to Knight Rider that really take you back and put you in the right space to meet Shaun. Shaun the films central character (played superbly by newcomer Thomas Turgoose) is a typical eighties kid, riding round on his griffter, washing neighbours cars for cash to buy a catapult and being constantly picked on for being different. When we first meet him we quickly learn that his father was a victim of the war raging at Maggie's command. Enter the gang Woody, Milky, Pukey, et all, a rag tag bunch of mods and skinheads complete with crimped haired girlfriends, with the absence of his father and any real sense of being part of something Shaun is quickly welcomed into the group and takes up not just the mannerisms or clothes but drinking, smoking and growing up to quickly. Things go OK for a while until Combo arrives on the scene. Straight out of prison and a British blooded skinhead through to his core you can sense trouble on the horizon. Soon the gang becomes segmented because of differences of opinion and fuelled by the war and the council estate mentality of accepting foreigners' things start to spiral out of control and Shaun finds himself in way above his head. A brilliantly written script that can at times have you laughing out loud and at others sitting nervously on the edge of your seat as the tension builds is delivered well by all the cast. The music is fitting, mixing eighties chart hits with haunting piano pieces and the cinematography is close to a previous Meadows outing 'A Room for Romeo Brass' which gives it a feel like it was filmed in the eighties. The attention to detail is brilliant as shop shelves are laden with products we no longer see or have long since upgraded there packaging. One of the scariest things was it was hard to imagine that time in this country because any of us who lived through it have almost chosen to block it out completely, but it was done so well and had me fishing in my memory to fit things into the time scale being used. There is defiantly a more matured Meadows at work here but he's lost none of his cheeky charm and observational skill and the characters he's created could have easily have lived next door to me growing up. The metaphor of the country getting behind Thatcher in the Falklands juxtaposed with that of the skinheads, including the initiated Shaun, getting behind the slightly off kilter Combo is handled with a great sense of poignancy and it is moving to see both stories unfold from within the film and library footage. Racism and intolerance are by no means behind us but here we are shown one of the skeletons in the Great British (sic) closet through the eyes of a child and one who would grow up to represent the next generation. Meadows has said in interviews that it is partly based on his experiences growing up and he sees a lot of himself in Shaun, I saw a lot of me in the character but I also saw memories I'd have rather forgotten. Funny, British and bleak Meadows is slowly climbing the ranks to join the Mike Leigh's and Ken Loach's of this world and if this film is anything to go by it wont take him very long. Any fan of Meadows previous work will love it and no doubt delight in his continuing growth as a filmmaker but everyone should see it regardless as it is another fine example of British film at its rawest and best.",2006
9,"'This is England' is a must see for the type of persons who enjoy a good old 'innocence of youth' narrative (including a very comedic, almost cringe inducing, 'first kiss' scene) layered with powerful retrospective British realism reflecting early 1980's societal issues of the type that you wont see on any saccharin dipped 'i remember 1982' clip show.",2006

7,"This 80s set drama reinforces Shane Meadow's reputation as an actor's director and one that thank god, is actually interested enough in his indigenous culture not to take a cheque from a Hollywood studio and waste his talent making American genre movies. Danny Boyle take note. Paul Anderson, stay where you are.",2007
3,The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances.,2007
6,Shane Meadows is a great example of a British film maker who is talented but who fails to maximise that talent . Where as Danny Boyle is often criticised for failing to maintain the first half momentum Meadows is slightly different in that he can come up with a good premise which he then proceeds to demolish via his own hand . Where as DEAD MANS SHOES quickly stops being gritty and realistic and becomes fantastical and silly TIE suffers from quickly turning from a heart warming film in to a mouth piece for Meadows which defeats the object of the exercise .,2010
1,"What can I say, I lived in England from 1982 to 1984, and England was not like this. Lame story, bad acting, the Skinhead characters came across as total W4nkers that you wouldn't want to know in real life. Overall the movie is a dud, not recommended. The scene where the 12 year old hero has a French Kissing festival with the 18 year old ""Smell"" I found very indecent. I found the social topic about racism within the Skinhead subculture to be a yawn. I cannot for the life of me understand that a movie, which trumpets itself as what England was like in 1983, failed to even mention the Irish Republican Armys Rampage in Englands cities at that time! From what I remember everyone in Britain bemoaned the IRA's campaign of terror, including this subject would of made a much better movie. Don't bother paying the rental fee for this movie.",2014
10,"Growing up in a small northern town in the '80s, I found 'This is England' to carry incredible resonance. For people from other countries to question the authenticity of the film is laughable. Take it from somebody who was there ¬ñ this is how it was. I remember skinheads kicking off in pub car parks because they knew the police were too busy dealing with striking miners to respond to any complaints. The entire production looks so authentic that at times it's as though you're watching a documentary filmed in 1983. The actors imbue characters that could easily become stereotypes with a depth that makes even the near-sociopathic Combo a sympathetic and tragic victim of his own emotional retardation. Several performances are award worthy and 'This is England' contains more of the real England, the England of my childhood, in just five minutes than all the middle-class fantasies of Richard Curtis combined.",2008
2,"This movie lacks in so many ways. It has no real purpose or meaning. Seemingly dragging on for too long then suddenly cutting short. It gives no real insight into the traditional skin head movement, the Nazi skin movement or the redskin sharp movement. There is allot of reggae but the history of the Jamaican striking skinheads isn't even brought up. The pro racism speech is a failed attempt at recreating the tension in American history X's rant. i was really disappointed with the film half way but decided to finish it in hopes the tables would turn.Heads up they did not.It gives no explanation for the characters views nor their actions. i really don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie.This film has no action, conflict, intellectual dialogue and spray painting Maggy is a **** on a wall does not make it historically accurate. sigh....",2012
3,"Why is this movie getting so much praise? It's just another coming of age movie framed by the director's dubious knowledge of a youth cult. It's no different than 'Suburbia' or 'SLC Punk' or I don't know... It's also very pretentious because the back drop is the Falklands war, trying to give the scenario some gravity.",2010
9,"Congratulations to Shane Meadows for capturing the sights, sounds and smells of the 1980's. It was spellbinding to watch the audience reaction as the set up of the film had its share of laughs for the youthful abandonment and micky taking that made up being a teenager during these times. Switching gear, trouble arrives like a boot to the face, in the shape of Combo. Releasd from prison and seeped in nationalist rhetoric. I found the film made an important distinction between the clans of traditional and neo-nazi skinheads. A point that has been long overdue in film. Focusing on a northern seaside town the setting could be anywhere in the UK, such is the power of the mirror of gang life. a great soundtrack and poignant dialogue when reflecting on the various characters lot...good luck at the awards!",2006

DO NOT WATCH! You have been warned. 2 great examples of the poor quality of the film;a scene where Shane and his mum are looking at a picture of his dad and both comment its their favourite picture of him, in the picture , you cant even see his face!

Of all movies in the world that I could see for a second time, Grandma's Boy was the one that did it for me. Not only did i see it twice in theater but I Paid twice to see it! No sneaking in, no illegal downloading...I have supported this movie! And why? Because never in my life have i found a movie that made me laugh so much. And i laughed just as much the second time as I did the first, perhaps more. Joel Moore owns this movie. He plays his character so well that you can't help but wonder how he did it. Makes me want to get metal legs too.I'm not saying everyone will find this movie funny...if you've never smoked a joint, played a video game or made a sexually explicit comment....well then yeah you'll probably sit through this like a wet fish. A sick sense of humor is kind of a must. Maybe you have to be a bit of a dork, i dunno. Fact is it had a good beginning, middle and ending and what could be better than that? (Even award winning Backdoor Mountain left me disappointed with the ending!?!) SO that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 10/10 for the best comedy of the year...and two thumbs down to the critics who are obviously too old and boring to find the crazyness of youth amusing.",2006
9,"First and foremost, I only gave this movie a 9 to out weigh all the 1s that morons are giving it, I believe that it truly deserves about a 6.5-7.0 (currently it has a 5.5 with 87 votes). Look this is a funny movie, it's not ground breaking and it is certainly low-brow but it's actually quite enjoyable. The critics are trying to make it into the worst movie of the new year, which is sad because, in my opinion, it's as funny as anything that came out last year, including wedding crashers (although wedding crashers, I'll admit is a better film). The story relies on comedy to get by, the plot bobs and weaves, sometimes awkwardly, in the name of telling a joke rather than flowing an interesting plot line, that said, I enjoy the filmmaker's willingness to disregard any attempt to make the story realistic or to make the transitions genuine. The flow of the story seems as if it is constructed in an alternate universe where random parties come together with ease, while it may sound as if I'm being sarcastic I'm certainly not, I believe that most movie transitions are simply labored and lame attempts to get from point A to point B, they just jump almost directly to what they want to do next in Grandma's Boy ala the first Wayne's World, which keeps the movie from sagging. All and all, I believe this is a great comedy, it's certainly not for those with high brow taste, remember, critics typically like comedies like Sideways and Broken Flowers, movies that, while entertaining, find it difficult to make a young person laugh. If you liked There's Something About Mary and previous Sandler films, with the exceptions of Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love, you will enjoy Grandma's Boy.",2006
9,One of the best stoner films i have seen in a long while. Even though I love such movies as Harold and kumar go to white-castle. I'd have to say this one was a lot funnier. With snappy lines the movie was great. Decent plot made the movie had just what it needed to be a classic stoner flick.i went to rent this movie with low expectations and when I had finished watching the movie even my father (who is somewhat strict) thought it was hilarious. See this movie. I was surprised to see that this movie had only a 6.6 on IMDb.com and see all of the comments that were negative. All in all this was a great movie and i would suggest it to anyone who likes a fun loving silly movie. oh and IMO i think that guy DOES look like Mel Gibson!,2007

Allen Covert did a REMARKABLE job writing this film, and It's easy to see where Sandler really gets his material  from.

I don't  know how many women in the gaming industry are as cute as she is - but  - it was great to see her in something as funny as Grandma's Boy after  seeing her every week on ER for the last couple years.

This movie is extremely funny and has a great story compared to most other comedy movies. It is better than Knocked Up and movies like that, in my opinion, because it never gets too serious. It stays funny the whole way through. I mostly enjoyed this movie because it is about video game testers and drugs. If that is not the type of movies you like it may not be for you. Buy it and watch it twenty times and you will still be finding new things to laugh at.",2008
1,"Creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. It either works, or it does not. Grandma's Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler films (sans Sandler himself, he's just a producer).",2006
1,"This movie is on the level with ""Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael"" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. If these guys weren't Adam Sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. I hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. I will admit that I have high standards, but honestly I'd rather watch Step Up 2. The ultra sad part was when I logged onto IMDb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. This is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. After seeing this rating, I would like to suggest ""Tyler Perry's House of Pain"" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.",2008
10,"This movie is the funniest I've seen in a long time. I'm a big fan of cinema but that doesn't mean i can't enjoy a classic stupid comedy like this one. The plot is lame its the side jokes that count. If you liked half-baked then you'll love this movie. The jokes come at odd angles and this movie is an instant quote classic. Dante ""Hey we'll go to the nut house together I don't give a f..."". The story is lame yes I can concede that fact. But Peter Dante gives the performance of his unremarkable career previously highlighted as the devil guy in ""Little Nicky"". A large amount of these jokes are understandable only within the context of the Gaming world. T-Shirt classics from the boys at Jinx.com - ""I hate this map"" will be totally lost on outsiders.",2006

I almost turned it off when I saw Adam Sandler's name, but I thought I'll give it a shot. After all...Shirley Jones is in it, and I have had the hots for Shirley since The Partridge Family days. The episode were Shirley wore hot-pants....very sexy! Ten minutes into the film....I was laughing out loud! How many of us know a headcase like Dante? This movie didn't get near the credit it deserved when it was out. Heck, even the cable company and their silly rating system gave it one star, meaning bad to poor. This is a funny film! Allen Covert gets all the credit here. He was simply great as the ""Old Bush""...Very funny! Nick Swardson was very good as his side-kick Jeff...The part about the bed made me laugh...I know a guy who still has one of those...Very sad indeed. Linda Cardellini was also extra hot as Samantha, the girl-love interest in the film. Everyone was quite good, even David Spade was funny...Which is rare! The only mark down is for Kevin Nealon as Mr. Cheezle, the owner of the company where all the vido geeks work. Every time he is on the screen....the films drags to a hualt! Not funny! But watch this film......You'll laugh!",2007
1,"If you are a horny 13 year old whose hobby is downloading porn, then you will probably like this film. The humor is about as unsophisticated as it comes. They tried hard to make this one into an American Pie or Something about Mary, but someone forgot to tell the filmmaker that gross does not necessarily equal funny. That seems to be the current trend in Hollywood these days. Among the atrocities that we have to endure in this film is several scenes with some fat ugly guy's mouth attached to a woman's breast. I think this was the same fat ugly guy who wanted to buy the platform shoes in the ebay store in ""the 40 year old virgin"". This must have been a friend of the director who was given this role so he could actually get his mouth on a breast as it probably never happened in real life. Whatever the reason, it never elicits a laugh and seems pointless. Then there is Shirley Jones, now a senior citizen, who is constantly talking about all the old Hollywood stars that she had relations with. Again, it seems like the director must have been a fan of the Partridge Family when he was a kid and had some fantasy of hearing Shirley Jones talking foul. Maybe it is humorous to the 13 year old I mentioned in my opening line, but it wasn't to me. There was one or two mildly amusing lines in this film, but that is not enough to come anywhere near recommending this garbage. The filmmaker needs to go out and rent a copy of ""Duck Soup"" and see what real comedy is all about.",2006
9,"Grandma's Boy is one of the most original comedies of the year, with 'Borat' beating it out in terms of sheer fun and originality. Most people will recognize the star of the film, Allen Covert, as 'that guy from Adam Sandler's movies'. This marks Covert's first starring role, alongside Linda Cardellini (Scooby Doo, 'ER'), Peter Dante (also a Sandler film veteran), Nick Swardson (Click, The Benchwarmers), Kevin Nealon (Saturday Night Live, Happy Gilmore), Joel David Moore (Dodgeball) and entertainment legends Doris Roberts and Shirley Jones. This excellent ensemble cast puts together a very fun movie that will provide you with hideous jokes, memorable one-liners, and just plain stoner fun. The plot is simple enough. After being kicked out of his apartment in a hysterical scene with another Sandler veteran, Alex (Covert) is forced to move in with his grandmother (Roberts) and her 2 roommates (Shirley's Knight and Jones), and hilarity ensues in ridiculous ways, ranging from animal and marijuana encounters with Dante (Dante...ironic, eh?), sexual tension with his new boss (Cardellini), stupid toilet jokes with his buddies (Swardson, among others), and making fun of his other bosses (Nealon and Moore), especially the just plain weird J.P. (Moore). The standouts are Linda Cardellini, Peter Dante, Nick Swardson, and Allen Covert himself. Cardellini's character is one of the coolest, and she's so cool that any guy wishes that her character was his girlfriend. Peter Dante's character, Dante, is so damn awesome. You'll see. The less you know about him, the better. Nick Swardson's character has some continuity issues but it is understandable if you can really get his character, Jeff. I love Nick Swardson in everything because he always manages to make me laugh (his Click cameo is priceless). Lastly, it's finally great to see Allen Covert holding his own in a movie after so long in the shadow of Adam Sandler, who is a producer of the film (sadly, he doesn't appear, but two of his most famous friends do appear, DB and JD (initials of their most famous characters). All in all, Grandma's Boy is a great comedy with unforgettable moments that will have you talking for a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone 15 and older, unless stupid drug and sex jokes are offensive to you.",2006
1,"Absolute rubbish. I'm really not sure how it has managed to garner such a high rating on IMDb (maybe pot smokers are getting discounts from their dealers if they log on to IMDb and give this movie a high rating?)

7,"The tag-line ""Old School American Horror"" is a little misleading. While it's true that ""Hatchet"" recalls the mad gore of the 1980s, the ""horror"" factor is actually absent. Watching the film feels more like viewing a condensed reel of slasher kills with a few drunk and fun-loving friends - certainly not a bad thing, but not exactly a horror movie either. That being said, it's obvious that the people involved in the production have a real love for the genre. Kane Hodder's monster antics are always a delight, and Adam Green will definitely be a name to watch in the future. ",2008
5,"Writing a review for Hatchet is almost pointless. Devotees of the horror genre will see this no matter what is written. In fact, a certain rhetorically named fan-boy website that prides itself on cool news has already lauded the movie's villain as the next horror icon.

I don't know why you would spend all of that money to make a bad movie. How hard could it have been to make a scary movie about a ""Jason -like "" character in the Louisianna swamp? The cast was do able, the plot was do able, even the humor was there, it just wasn't scary.

10,"I recently went to see the debut of Hatchet in NYC, and it was great: a perfect mix of graphic violence and comedy that had me screaming, cheering, cringing and laughing out loud from beginning to end. Writer/director Adam Green is the real deal, not trying to make a quick buck by following the latest box office trends. This movie pays homage to the classic horror movies (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Candyman, etc.), and Green does it with class and wit. The actors play their parts well - they are convincing in the horror scenes and hysterical in between. Be warned: the violence is very graphic, and there is a lot of topless nudity. If you can stomach it, and if you like this genre of film, then this is the movie for you. Hatchet is pure entertainment!",2006
4,"Most popular web sites covering the horror genre are embarrassing. You probably know exactly which ones I'm talking about. There are a handful of them, and they're always the ones being quoted on DVD covers and in commercials. What burns my goat is that these sites frequently lead horror fans astray by shamelessly gushing over the most clich√©-ridden and mediocre crap being released these days. Why do they do this? The majority simply aren't impartial. Many of those in charge of these websites kiss so much director, producer and actor ass that they are no longer capable of writing an unbiased or less-than-flattering review. They fear that by speaking the truth they will risk the opportunity to get into advance screenings and may no longer receive free film merchandise, DVDs, early screener copies or chances to network and get themselves small movie roles, as well as possibly forfeiting bragging rights that ""so-and-so"" is a close personal friend of theirs. They know that throwing out excellent reviews to average (or in many cases awful) films equals free advertisement. These people aren't in this for their genre love as much as they are in it for themselves and thus everyone should really take most reviews from any of these online sites with a grain of salt.

I really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so I could get out and watch something else. Unfortunately, I did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is. There wasn't booing, after all, this is England, just gentle moans about how crap that was. Then, I look on IMDb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10. I really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score. They must be a PR company working with the distributor. There's a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film, when in the graveyard and the hick attacks, look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched (supposed to be a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay OTT - the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the Director.",2007

1,"I read the recent comments and couldn't wait to see the movie. however, after sitting through 80 minutes of predictable ""suprises"" that didn't even make me jump and unrealistic villain, i was left hugely disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long. I thought this might be because of the edits to make it 'R' rated, but the original only contained ten more minutes of ""Kill Bill"" type blood. When blood sprays out like hoses, reality loses appeal. Add in the killer who's supposed to be a ""ghost"" but can rip someones head off from the jaw (ala King Kong with the T-Rex), lives through everything and has an ending similar to that of the sopranos finale and you quite possibly have the most over-hyped movie in the last year. After watching the movie i felt like i had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt largely unsatisfied. I dunno what everyone else saw in it, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth the $10.

Some idiot described this trash as the next icon of horror and actually had the nerve to say it was scary.What is scary and truly frightening is how many people liked it.

But also William Friedkin had directed the film, William isn't just the director of The Exorcist, he's an incredible director who has many works of art under his belt. So I rented Bug and watched it last night and I have to say that this was an incredibly disturbing psychological thriller that really freaked me out. I mean, these performances were absolutely amazing, most people are raving about Ashley Judd's performance, but what about Michael Shannon? In my opinion, he had the best performance, he was so intense and he really draws you into the scene and the story.",2007

I am so impressed by Ashley Judd, who I always liked, but had no idea of her range and courage. The film is very disturbing...I would describe it as a dark comedy that gets darker and darker and darker...calling it horror is too limited although there are horror elements to it. It reminds me of Cronenberg or early Polanski (Repulsion). But comparisons don't really do it justice. It's exciting to see that there are directors that still have guts. I was exhilarated and disturbed by the end of this film. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants something different and powerful.",2006
9,"Many viewers have been bashing this film, and for the mainstream crowd expecting an obvious crowd-pleaser focused on one genre, I can completely understand why you didn't like the film. However, the film goes much deeper than it appears to be. Many people are expecting a horror film, and are confused by the intense monologues and the dark comedy mixed in with the self-inflicted torture and self-defense from the outside world, which are clearly characteristics of a psychological thriller. The movie was not meant to have any ""heroes"" or ""villains"", but it was meant to show everyday people in an everyday world, with one woman so lonely, so desperate to have someone who can love her, who finally finds someone who can read her, that she sets aside the fact that he is a paranoid schizophrenic who believes that someone is out to get him. After many hours and days spent together, cut off from society, she gradually becomes one with him, his madness slowly sinking into her mind as she joins him in his own delusional world. The film is not your average film, and will understandably turn off or confuse many viewers. Please note, however, that the film deals with an extremely serious illness that can't be ""prettied up"" or be made simpler to try and understand what's going on. It just presents itself in a straight-forward, natural form, which is usually tougher to understand and accept, much like the film.",2007

The Barrow Street Bug didn't require any big names or high production values ¬ñ the stage didn't even have a curtain ¬ñ for its startling effects. Twenty dollars got you an evening of strange thinking and unpredictable behavior. The NYTimes called it ""the season's wildest ride""; The New Yorker's sketch suggested it was the best play in town.

I wasn't sure what to expect -- a horror flick, a spy/government secret thriller, science fiction. My basic contention is the movie was a study of folie a deux, a disorder in which two (or sometimes more, but generally just two) people with a close relationship share a psychotic delusion. While only one person in the pairing is psychotic, the other develops psychosis -- including delusions, paranoia, even hallucinations -- by virtue of their closeness to the psychotic person. Often, such couple will be isolated and avoid contact with others. I came across this phenomena years ago while researching some other subject, and thought about it tonight while viewing the film. Aggie's final speech about how incidents in her life have tied together with Peter's arrival was an over-the-top example of how she now shared his paranoia. Generally, folie a deux develops between an extremely close couple (such as a married couple), but Aggie's loneliness, misery and fear (due to the recent release of her con ex-husband), along with her drinking, smoking crack, and doing blow, accelerated their feelings of and dependence on each other.",2006

You never really know for certain in this movie, if this man was really a schizophrenic or was all he claimed real? He makes far-out claims to his only friend in the world, who happens to be a screwed up drunkard and junkie woman (that soon ends up being also a girlfriend) to this guy. He insists that he has been a victim of top secret experiments! Nothing less than a human guinea pig and example of a secret military government experiment. He says, he has been deliberately infected and implanted with the eggs of a supposedly high tech bug. Which is now out of control, taking over his body and living on his blood supply. The government supposedly did this to him as a top secret experiment on him and one other person? We never do really hear the truth or do we? But the case is, we even might believe that this man is (perhaps) instead very insane and schizophrenic and imagining this entire thing???? See it, if you dare. I can promise you this is a very strange film, but at the same time a very strong film and very well directed. You may never know the real truth? I can say, this man is insane and this woman also very insane! But before this film is finally at its end, you will be wondering too, just which story is indeed the true story? Remember we see mostly what they (think) they see or do we? This is a dark film and as it progresses it becomes even darker and it continues to do so up until its twisted end. The directer and the writer both did a great job creating this story line and making it work on film. As dark as this movie might be, it is still done without loosing our attention to its storyline and the presentation of the convincing talents of these actors. I think the intention is obvious here with this film, they wanted a strange and different tale to tell and they did a wonderful job doing just this.

1,"This film belongs in the ""call my dentist, I'd much rather have a root canal"" category. My wife and I attended this film, ignoring the fact that the usher had told us people were walking out on this movie in droves, and there were more than a few asking for a refund. We had already paid, and I thought, ""How bad could it be""? I, and the three other people (including my wife) in the theater soon found out. ",2007
10,"The movie ""Bug"", by William Friedkin, was by far one of the most intense psychological thrillers I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It truly does make you question almost everything. It really gets inside you and makes you feel a certain sense of paranoia. I very much liked the symbol of the ""bugs"" themselves. The idea that the modern, everyday American can know so little but know everything at the same time, the idea that they question everything and believe so much of nothing at all. The idea of complete paranoia, thats the symbol of the bugs. It gets inside you, makes you feel uneasy, makes you almost crazy, it can even make you kill yourself. This is by far, one of the most inspiring films ever made. To many others it may be just stupid but thats only because they do not understand it truly. Thats my thought on the movie.",2007
10,"It's very hard to write a review of this film that isn't full of spoilers. Suffice to say that it's unfortunate that this is being marketed as a horror film. While it is definitely an intense film, it really isn't about bugs that eat people so much as it is about the minds of the characters. The story is taut and the character development is handled beautifully throughout, one of the advantages, no doubt of having a small cast of experienced character actors such as this one. The performances of that cast are nearly breathtaking at times, particularly those of Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon who create amazingly convincing studies of emotionally wrecked people descending into a nightmare world of their own paranoia.",2007
8,...But more of a psychological drama dealing with two people who are slowly going insane.,2007
10,"What a fantastic surprise! We saw this as a compromise between Spiderman (my husband) and Away from Me (me), and we LOVED it. And who knew? 70+-year old Friedkin, the one-hit-wonder who did The Exorcist? What a stroke of genius that he pushed to adapt this play AND insisted on hiring Michael Shannon, who played the character off-Broadway. This has to be Ashley Judd's best performance yet, and it's a little bit too bad b/c many people won't view it that way. Michael Shannon, Judd and Harry Connick, Jr. are incredible at portraying ""crazy."" An interesting peek into the world of a paranoid schizo. Lots of people in the audience didn't ""get it,"" so if you don't appreciate an artful, ""small,"" shoestring budget thriller, don't go. (I felt the same about Black Snake Moan, although an entirely different movie. Lots of people thought it was just strange. It was wonderful.)",2007
9,I found this to be a troubling movie.,2007

8,The Good Shepherd 3.5/4 4/5,2006
9,"A gray winter day was a fitting time to see one of the first public screenings of a film called ""The Good Shepherd,"" whose chilly hero Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, in a role modeled in part on CIA founder, James Jesus Angleton) is not so much all things to all men as nobody to anybody. A composite figure in a portrait of the birth, rise, and moral shriveling of the American CIA, Matt Damon's disturbingly shut-down Wilson would be one of recent film's most tragic figures if he were not such a hollow, unappealing man. Directing a long-contemplated project using a screenplay by Eric Roth (who penned ""Munich""), Robert De Niro has forged a ""Godfather"" of Yankee spy-craft, a heavy, solemn epic about betrayal and loyalty in the world of espionage and counter-espionage dominated not by Italians as in the original ""Godfather,"" though Coppola produced, De Niro directed, and Joe Pesci has one of the liveliest on screen moments, but by uptight, stony, patrician WASPs.",2006
7,"I can't vouch for how much truth can be found in ""The Good Shepherd."" After all, how much can you really know about an organization that deals in lies? But I do know that Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is the perfect, duty-bound man of privilege -- born in the north east, bred in the Ivy League, lured into a secret society of cocky heirs to American industry, and made into a man feared by others only because he, himself, feared his superiors.

10,"""The mental facility to detect conspiracies and betrayal are the same qualities most likely to corrode natural judgment."" Almost every year, there is one great film that slips under my radar. I usually wait for it to hit DVD because it keeps getting passed over for other films I'd rather watch. However, when I finally get around to seeing it, I wonder to myself how I ever let it pass me by.",2007

8,"If you're out to see a movie soon, this is one that should be on the top of your list. An all-star cast and an intriguing story isn't all that this movie has. It has some great performances from both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie that are likely to get some award nominations.",2006
3,I went in this one really wanting to like it. What an incredible concept! But the film just didn't do a thing for me.,2006
8,"I had a huge advantage before watching this on DVD. I was told by a good friend that it was extremely slow, and be prepared to be bored out of ""my mind."" Well, I wasn't bored, maybe because I now expected a slower, non-action-packed CIA-type film....and I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I liked it, mainly because of the cinematography. This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.",2007

9,"Not for the dim or distracted, this outstanding trans-generational exploration of father/son paranoia and betrayal fueled by unresolved oedipal turmoil takes us on a historical tour of US Intelligence from the OSS of World War II to the Bay of Pigs. Acting, editing and directing are all superb. The characters are complex and vital, and the relationships textured. ",2006
4,"I wanted to like it, I really did. I bought my ticket for The Good Shepard solely based on a few trailers I saw in the fall....Damon, DeNiro, Pesci, Jolie...spies, the CIA, THE COLD WAR!!!!...this had to be good, or so I thought. Unfortunately, in one of the worst editing jobs I've ever seen, DeNiro lets this movie meander into a dismal abyss where the viewer begins to foretell the scenes and even the conclusion well before they happen.

8,"The movie jumps back and forth in time periods. Sometimes we're lucky enough to get a TV image of President Kennedy in the Cuban Missle Crisis to know that we've suddenly entered the time-warp from the 1940s to 1961. Other times, there is no such clue such as a jump of probably a few hours or days such as when a perfidious German woman assistant gets her just reward. We don't know whether to dispatch those assassins with silencers on their pistols after the screenplay writer or the film editor.",2006
9,A sincere congratulations to the filmmakers who wove this intricate deceit and an even sincerer kudos to the few who were able not only to remain in their seats but also to appreciate the latent hues of what appeared to many a sterilely colored film.,2006
10,"This is an excellent movie. Very complex. And without the simple ""signals"" many movies use to lead along the viewer. It's difficult to understand how truthful it is. Secrets are secrets. This comment is just to make a note of the tradecraft and other espionage activities found in the movie.",2007
1,"This film is extremely inefficient, pointless, emotionless and suspenseless (save a few moments in the last hour). After two hours of watching I still found myself unrewarded for my patience. I didn't care anymore, it was going nowhere slow. A great movie is supposed to fascinate you from beginning to end, not to let you wait 2 hours for that to happen.",2007
10,"I have not seen a movie that I have been happy with for over a year, and I was very pleasantly surprised with ""The Good Shepherd"". The plot is intricate and keeps throwing twists and turns throughout the film. In addition, this film has single-handedly changed my opinion of Matt Damon. He was absolutely excellent in this thrilling drama, and in my opinion is worthy of an Oscar nomination, as is most of the cast. Robert De Niro showed absolute mastery in his direction of Eric Roth's screenplay, and the whole quality of the experience truly reminded me of such epic classics as The Godfather. ""The Good Shepherd"" is long in duration, but keeps you on the edge, making the time fly. Plus, the movie is truly star-studded with many of the supporting roles played by Hollywood Heavyweights. If you love dramas, political espionage, or just an excellent character-driven film (the depth that De Niro gives these characters is amazing), you will LOVE this movie! Thank you Mr. De Niro for restoring my faith in movies. DEFINITE Oscar CONTENDER!",2007
6,"""The Good Shepherd"" is my second best film of 2006. A lot of people who have seen it will think differently and I can understand that. This film is not for everyone, but the viewers who have a love for US History, The Cold War, CIA, Espionage, or Spy films should be pleased with ""The Good Shepherd."" It is very subtle, but extremely effective. ",2007

9,"Men like Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) select a path of life set apart from society, so those living in the fold of our free system can do so, completely unaware of the man who holds the Sheperd's crook. Edward is a true patriot. The safety of the United States and it's citizens are in his hands. The elements of The Good Shepard are the life experiences of Edward and how after accepting a commission from U. S. Army Intelligence on the day of his nuptials, separates the young couple for the next six years. The bespectacled face of Edward Wilson hides the stone cold calculating heart of a man who knows he will come home from the war. He returns to a wife who does not love him and a five year old son who does not know him. The C.I.A. is the perfect government agency for Edward to continue his protecting of the flock. The sequencing of the film, is in itself a story about many secrets and who can be trusted with these secrets. Edward's right hand man Ray Bucco (John Tuturro) throughout the entire film gives a stunning performance well worth a nod for a recommendation for a Best Supporting Oscar. As The Good Shepard draws towards a close, the audience remembers that this was a period piece from the late 1920's through the mid 1960's and as Edward disappears into C.I.A. Headquarters one can only think of the next bespectacled Sheperd taking his place.",2006
1,"Too long and boring. the story was very disconnected. in fact, there was hardly a believable story. many scenes were extremely disjointed. it didn't allow you to get attached to any of the characters. it was so hard to follow that I just wanted to leave the theatre. I was frustrated. Damon's robotic acting was dry and depressing and was not believable. We go to see a film to be entertained. We didn't want to have to sit there and have to try so hard to connect the numerous subtle transitions in each scene. You were constantly left one step behind to make the connections. And as soon as you did make the connection, many of them were scenes unnecessary to the film. they were stupid connections...many of which were not relevant to the weak story line. For instances, Damon and Joile had a one night stand. She gets pregnant. Her brother tells Damon ""you'll do the right thing."" OK, shotgun wedding, loveless marriage. They don't see each other. they both have affairs. the scene with Joile showing all that emotion over seeing the pictures of his secretive affair that she claimed humiliated her,was stupid. i didn't connect with that at all. it didn't add any value to the film. There was no scene to connect you with the son falling in love. So, I absolutely cared less about them throwing her out of the airplane and I didn't feel for the son's loss at all,or anything or anybody else. OH, I GET IT. THE DIRECTOR WANTED US TO NOT FEEL ANYTHING IN THIS FILM... NOT THAT'S BRILLIANT!",2006
1,"Today I found myself in a dilemma. I was sitting at my computer, and House of Payne came on. But the remote was all the way over on the couch. I didn't want to get up, but there was no way I was going to watch House of Payne. Out of the question. So I picked myself up off my comfy computer chair and changed the channel. Why is this relevant? House of Payne is the type of show that can't be ignored, and I don't mean that in a good way. I can't sit here and go about my business when House of Payne is on, because as hard as I try to ignore it, the bad jokes and terrible acting always catch my attention.",2009
1,I've been reading the user comments and threads on the message board for a week even though I hadn't seen the show yet. I just found the posts amusing.,2007
1,"Tyler Perry's House of Payne is a fantastic show! I love how the actors are horrible and have no sense of comedic timing! I love how the writers write awful plots with awful jokes to fill in the 20 minutes the show is on the air! I love how the characters are paper thin, stereotypical, and just flat out annoying! I love how this show is crap! My first paragraph was a thick dose of sarcasm.",2009
1,"I've watched this show a couple times, and each time I thought the punchline was the show itself, not actually any of the jokes in the show. The show plays like a ""MAD-TV"" sketch that is a parody of bad sitcoms, but as you watch this further, you realize that what your watching is an actual sitcom meant to be funny on its own merits. Normally, humor of this level is on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel and for children, but I think this show is actually meant for adults and sober ones at that. This show reminds me of ""Kenan & Kel"" or another show meant for kids with cheesy jokes and lame humor that only children would laugh at. The only way you can tell something is supposed to be funny is when the laugh track plays, otherwise I wouldn't even know this was meant to be a comedy.",2008
1,"Words cannot capture just how bad this show really is. It probably sets black culture back 50 years. Horrible writing, impossibly predictable stereotypical characters, and actors that look to be mailing it in make me wonder who at TBS could have possibly thought this was a good idea.",2007
1,"I love all of Tyler Perry's work and I have all of his plays on DVD and I will buy his movies also. I was waiting on the show and TBS has been acting like this is going to be the show of the year. The show is not good at all. It is so stereotypical and I am black and we need more positive images of black people on TV. Why does the movies and plays always have to have a crackhead mama and a smart mouth daughter? Come on people the show does not have to put our people in that type of element to survive. The kids on the Bernie Mac Show, My Wife and Kids, etc don't have sassy mouth kids that disrespect the adults. I love Tyler but it seems like most of his plays have the same story line and Tyler fans can not lie about that. Most of his plays have a crackhead mama,etc. The actors are good in his plays but on the show they are over doing the punch lines because the punchlines are not funny. I thought I was the only one at my job that thought the show is terrible until all of the black people at job started talking about it and we keep giving it another chance and we will keep watching to check for improvements but we all agree the first four episode were pretty bad. (The COONING and SHUCKING and JIVING is working our nerves. The Cosby Show didn't have people acting like that either.",2007
1,"Seriously, I like Tyler Perry's work, material, etc. but this has to be one of the worst, tedious pieces of crap called entertainment ever. For one, the plot is kind of pointless and not well thought of. This guy named C.J. moves in with his Aunt and Uncle and focuses on taking care of his two kids, sheltering them from their drug-addicted mother. Doesn't that sound familiar to you? It sure does to me. Perry literally took ideas from a diary of a mad black women and put in this brain cell killing ""sitcom"". Remember Perry in the movie played a father of two taking care of his kids while the mother of his kids was in a crack house? Yeah, you see it now? My point is that it goes to show that Perry can't come up with any new ideas and goes as far as to using old ones from previous works. Yeah that's creative. Another thing that bothers me is the character are all imbeciles especially Cirtus.....@_@. The acting in general is bad and that's as far as I would go. I just can't believe this show has been going on for 3 years and STILL has not been canceled. Here's some advice....just don't watch it.",2008
1,"I just wanna know how a show becomes the #1 comedy on cable in the country, however, i turn to another channel and state of grace has become the number 1 drama on cable in history??? who makes that stuff up? honestly? that's pure rubbish right there.",2009
1,"I only gave it a one because there was nothing lower to give. I have  yet to laugh and watched both episodes. What would inspire a Black man  today to create Bafoonery at its Worst. The direction was absolutely  horrible. The writing is worst than the directing. The acting is worst  than the directing and writing. Why Keke Palmer would ever add her name  to this cast is very confusing in my opinion. How do you go from Angela  Bassett and Lawrence Fishburne to this crap? Why are the jokes so  horrible and out of sync? Things are repeated as if the viewer cares if  they heard it the first time. The best part of the show is the little  girl. The father looks younger than the son. Bamboozled. I  felt Bamboozled when I watched it. TBS actually picked this up?  American TV is soon to be extinct if shows like this can get 100  episodes. Please STOP the madness. Trash this show while you can. The  people who gave this show 10 stars must be delusional. I have never  seen acting so staged and fake. The actors have no real emotion at all.  Allen Payne, I truly do not know what to say except for ESCAPe from  this deal while you still have your pride. Garbage.",2007
1,"What is wrong with mainstream America? Who watches this lame material? This embarrasses me. This guy has never been funny in his LIFE. What simpletons think this is funny???? His comedy is an insult to our intelligence not to mention condescending to black folks... Why, oh why does he feel compelled to ""self tag"" everything he writes too???? What is that all about??? Would anyone with any sense of self confidence self esteem or A SLIVER OF HUMILITY need to do that??? By the way, I wouldn't want anyone to know I had anything to do with this stuff... And who does he have non-flattering pictures of that keep signing him to T.V. and movie contracts? The overall rating for this series is a ""1""????? And all the African Americans that praise this guy, be careful..Is this the best the black community has to offer? No it isn't. No way. This guy dumbs down all who watch this stuff. I cant help he came from humble beginnings..so did I.. but that doesn't mean I can write movies??? Unorignal, Unfunny, Unflattering and did I mention Unfunny??? Mind Boggling..but then, maybe he's just so simple that he's over my head....",2009
6,"If you have seen the plays then you would get this. Tyler writes with  REAL emotions so hopefully it translates to what you see on the screen.  OK so the acting is a bit eh. But that is due to mostly unknowns  playing these roles. Everyone has to start somewhere. I don't know  about you, but I do not want to see the SAME 5 black actors playing  these roles. Hollywood plays it safe when casting Black projects using  the already limited black actor casting pool as it is. The actors in  this show are a nice departure from seeing Gabrielle Union, Vivica Fox  and company. So have an open mind, appreciate that Tyler is giving  folks a chance in showcasing a different side of the Black American  Family Sitcom. Not everyone can be Cliff and Claire. It's 2006 so it is  OK. Right?  Oh and bravo to showing in selected markets. Tyler Perry's plays are  famous but not everyone gets ""it"". SO why not go where your loyal  audience is? If he had the marketing team aware of that then fine.",2006
1,"The actors did not jell at all together, there were no cohesiveness in their personalities. It was if each character was trying to make a name for themselves as the leader or the funniest one on the show. No one stood out as the glue that held the show together to make it funny. Everyone stood out independent of each other, they did not compliment each other at all. The script was far from being funny, therefore the characters were not funny. Even though some may have been seasoned actors/actresses unless they blend like flavored seasoning to make food taste good, the outcome will taste bad. Ditch the current writers, borrow some from Madea. I think the actors can act but the writers just wrote poor lines for them to use. I recommend some team building for the cast. Tell the cast to go away somewhere together and get to know one another and blend in and jell. If you choose not to remove the current staff of writers, then they to need to do the same go away and blend.",2006
1,"House of Payne may remarkably be the worst show I've ever witnessed on cable. The show lacks comedy, acting, and scripting. Without a doubt, Tyler Perry should allow others to become involved and write a bit without him getting 100% involed. The cast of characters are okay, many you've seen if you're a Tyler Perry fan, but could do better. Direction needs to improve entirely. Nothing is done right and is all loose. And the laughter! It is cheesy and senseless, played at all the wrong times.",2007
1,"This show is absolutely appalling. First of all, it is not funny. At all. Not in the least bit. The actors are awful and... it's just not funny. I did not laugh once during both episodes. It was like watching a train wreck. It's horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from. The story line is way too heavy for a sitcom. The house burning down in the first episode and finding out the wife is a crack head in the second??? Whoa. Too much. Tyler Perry's movies and plays are hilarious... but this? Abysmal. It's like he tried to make one of his plays into a sitcom with no Madea. Bad combination. It just didn't work. A word of advice to Mr. Perry: Stick with what you do best... making us laugh so hard we cry, not just making us cry.",2006
10,"This is a good dramedy and I like the way Perry balances out the good  with the bad (drug addicted mother/very caring father) and the funny  with the sad. In the tradition of the Jeffersons and All in the Family,  the father, who may seem a bit ignorant to some, has most of the funny  lines. And of course we have the loving and patient wife (Weezy and  Edith) to balance him out.  I've loved Allen Payne since he was Lance on the Cosby Show and  especially in Jason's Lyric. He's a talented actor and I'm glad to see  him in the spotlight again. I'm not too familiar with the other actors,  but the Mom and Pop make the cutest couple.  I'm happy to see positive black male role models in this sitcom and  hope it stays on for a while.",2006
10,I absolutely love the House of Payne. It was obvious the first couple of episodes were trying to build a foundation and the actors were still transitioning from plays to small screen but as the series continued I began to see the potential of greatness. I love the story line. Most sitcoms deal with a lot of things that really don't matter and most dramas are sometimes to heavy. I think House of Payne gives a little of both worlds. This show deals with a real situation that many people have experienced. It is nice for a change to have real life depicted on television. This show has been a great discussion piece in my home. It has given me a great opportunity to discuss drug use and trust with my girls. I am excited about the show and am praying that it is picked up for many seasons to come.,2006
10,"I got the first season from amazon right after Christmas of 2010. I watched the first episode and didn't really like it. I was going to sell it. I decided to give it a second chance, and I am glad that I did. The show is based on the life of the Payne family. You get to see all the things that happen to them in their lives. It almost makes you feel like your watching a real family. Episodes make you laugh, cry and get angry. They deal with real issues. I was really surprised to see the review of this show. I think this show takes getting used to. It is almost like a play. It has a weird feel to it. I know there are some who will give up and not care. But if you stick with it, you may just find a great show that feels like a TV classic.",2011
10,"It took me a few shows to get into it but I'm hooked and have recorded every one of them. I was wondering when are they going to start back. I watch them for two weeks straight and then nothing. I'm hooked on the storyline and awaiting more. My children and I have made your show our family time and I think this show will give me some quality time with my children like the ""Cosby Show"" did with my parents an me when I was growing up. I think that is what our culture need today; positive entertainment. Tyler thanks for all you have done and are doing for our people. Your vision may even bring a generation back from being lost.",2006
6,"It's not my favorite show or is it a perfect show, but as comedy goes, it's pretty dang funny! I like all the characters and the story is pretty good too. I'm glad it lasted as long as it did. The ""dark"" theme in the show is not bad for others to see. Honestly, it's great that Tyler Perry wants others to know that life is not all about fun and games. The show is stupid, but that's the point! The reason why so many people like it is because it's different and new. (On the side line: I like that it's based in Atl, GA, because I live in GA.) Honestly, I can see why people don't like the show, but that doesn't mean they need to ruin it for the majority that do like it. If no one liked the show then it wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. But for those who don't like it...don't be haters. Especially if you don't like it because it's not as dirty as Family Guy or American Dad. A good, or even great show, doesn't need to be filthy. The filthiness is a HUGE turn off for me.",2011
10,"wow! i love this show. i laughed so hard. i wish it aired world wide. it needs to air in south Carolina as well.Tyler please keep up the great work! the characters in the show are wonderful actors and actresses. i love the father (curtis). you cant get any funnier that him. i didn't want the show to end. come on Tyler! you just have to air the show in south Carolina. this show to me beats out all the black sitcoms that are on TV today and it truly gets my vote. (Wonderful....just Wonderful).i like the fact that the show deals with real life situations.one episode dealt with drugs and thats one topic that needs to be heard. people need to see where the use of drugs will take a person.it not only effects that person but the entire family. so again, please keep up the great work!",2007
10,"After a slow start with first episode, the show picked up and I give it two thumbs up and kudos to Tyler Perry, and the whole cast of House of Payne. Hopefully, House of Payne will be added to the fall lineup and put in a different time slot perhaps at 8pm. I would love to see Tyler Perry make an occasional appearance on in a while. I think he is hilarious. I have seen his plays and movies and could not stop laughing my side was actually hurting. Another thing I like about his new show, is that there are no stereotypes. I love the fact that there is so much love displayed. It reminds of what my mother said about families always helped each other out (way back when. You don't see a lot of that today.People are selfish and self involved. House of Payne is a positive and family oriented show that I would recommend to Tyler Perry fans and those who have no idea who he is.",2006
10,"House of Payne was a fresh breath of air for me...The cast was great, especially the Father, and Mrs. Cloretha(acting just like church folk)...Dealing with drug addiction is a strong issue, and I know nobody has ever dealt with that issue within a comedy...Thanks Tyler, for keeping it real!!!! Sorry to everybody that doesn't get it, but this kind a thing is happening everyday in our black families, rather its the hood or upper class., this is a issue that should be dealt with....the most touching part to me, is when C.J. tells his mom that he is not a kid anymore, and he know whats going on with her,, and then he gives her his little savings (now that was so real) These kids today are a lot smarter than we think,,, Tyler, Continue to deal with this issue on T.V. where everybody can see it,,,,",2006
6,"You can get a pretty good idea of Southland Tales from a quick description of its characters. Dwayne Johnson plays Boxer Santaros, a movie star in Richard Kelly's all-too-near dystopian future. But it's not that straightforward. Johnson plays The Rock playing Boxer Santaros, while Boxer is playing the role of a character he's researching, one Jericho Kane. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays an ageing porn-star with a business portfolio that includes energy drinks. And Sean William Scott? Well, he plays a cop's amnesiac twin brother, as part of a neo-Marxist scheme to overthrow the government. Or does he? And you thought Donnie Darko was confusing. Welcome to Southland...",2007

I found it a weak attempt at David Lynch-level pop surrealism aimed at self-serious teenagers. Years later, I agreed to watch it again, after reading all the notes on the film and after Kelly, with his ""director's cut,"" bent over backwards to convince his audience that what he really made was a complicated science fiction movie, not a typically Lynchian drama about a lonely loser's fantasy life during the moments before his death. It made more sense, but for me it also took away what little heart the story actually had. Now that Kelly's long-awaited sophomore effort Southland Tales has hit the screen, I am more convinced than ever that the emperor's not wearing any clothes. Richard Kelly is a bad filmmaker.",2007
2,"After over a year of waiting, Southland Tales is finally out in theaters. The slightly abridged version, still clocking in at well over 2 hours, boasts an incredibly recognizable cast, and very well done visuals.",2007
1,"I was attracted to this film because I was a fan of Donnie Darko, as well as the ensemble cast that came together for this project. It is with great sadness that I must declare this one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't usually post comments about movies that fall short of their expectations, because film is a difficult art form. However, I found myself getting angry with how complex the story was as they say genius is making the complex, simple. That being said, I will applaud the effort to make a 'modern day' revelations biblical story. However, if Seann William Scott is or messiah, then it would truly be the end of the world. This movie did not work on so many levels, so I won't go into detail, but I will say that I felt robbed of 144 minutes. Perhaps this will have a cult following like Donnie Darko, and perhaps I could appreciate this project more by looking at the graphic novel, website and other source material, but after experiencing Southland Tales the film, I feel time is too precious for that. The last thing I will comment on about this film is the wonderful.... ---Insert something appreciative about this film--",2008
1,"I'm throwing in the towel on Richard Kelly. While I was never a big fan of ""Donnie Darko"", I felt it was an interesting beginning and a writer/director to watch out for. While I thought his script for ""Domino"" was good, this trash named ""Southland Tales"" is proof that Kelly has extremely promising ideas, he just can't fulfill on the promise of them and then he crams as much stuff as he can into one movie to mask over the fact he doesn't get the concept of what he's writing about. I'm all for films that think outside of the box. I would have been for a movie that was about a neo-marxist movement, a movie about an amnesiac time-traveler, a movie about manipulative drugs used during wars, but to stuff that all into one film and expect it to make sense? Not one of the characters makes sense, the plot can't focus at all, and it just doesn't add up, at all.",2008
1,"As the movie was going on, I felt like I was watching a movie made out of a fourteen year old boys journal. I will change my review if Kelley was trying to make the most ridiculous movie ever, because he succeed brilliantly at that.",2007
9,"overly-ambitious? probably. puzzlingly dense? certainly. meandering and confusing? absolutely.

3,"Sorry, I couldn't pontificate enough about the mess that was Southland Tales. Sure, it was broad, intriguing and certainly strange enough to be a cult classic, but the whole idea of a cult classic is that it should have some semblance of being a good film.",2008
4,"Now, this film has some definite problems, but it receives a 10 in my book for the director's insistence on trying something different. This film certainly doesn't offer a story that fits the A,B,C, plot mold of standard Hollywood pictures and it lacks slightly in characterization, but makes up for it with idea's, experimental style, and a ""european"" view of the current climate of the United States of America (now matter what your politics).",2006

3,"The real failure of this film isn't that it's overcomplicated in terms of plot. It is definitely overloaded with plots and subplots, characters, and various allusions to the arts. Its downfall is that it uses its central theme of media criticism as an excuse not to present its ideas coherently -- it critiques an incoherent form in an incoherent way. Pot Kettle Black. ",2007
8,"""Disjointed, messy, too long, pretentious..."" etc. - Just some of the critique thrown at this movie. I agree with most of it. But I still personally think Southland Tales is a good ,well... I hesitate to call it a movie in a traditional sense of the word, let's just say Southland Tales is a very interesting experience. ",2008
10,"I had not heard much about Southland Tales when I started to rent it. The only reason I was getting it was because I will watch anything with Sarah Michelle Gellar and always enjoy her even if I do not enjoy the movie. I had no idea what I was in store for. While watching this movie, I just became so, entranced. From beginning to end, I was loving every second and I could not figure out why. Maybe because it is so eccentric and well executed that it seems weird to like it for how odd it is. Maybe the performances were giving the film it's edge where the plot was so original and crisp. No, the real reason I enjoyed this movie is because it was so incredibly interesting and fun to watch, and it appeared to me as a perfect film throughout my whole viewing, when in reality it is one big mess. Yes, this is quite perfectly the most beautiful piece of junk I have ever seen, and I can not get enough of it! ",2008
2,"""Southland Tales,"" the latest film by ""Donnie Darko""'s Richard Kelly, is like the movie equivalent of one of those whistles that only dogs can hear; it is pitched so far out of ordinary human range that most viewers will be left scratching their heads, wondering where the hell the joke is and why they just don't get it.",2008
10,"This movie is intense.

7,"This movie doesn't really work, which is a pity, because it involves a lot of interesting ideas, put together in quite an eccentric and idiosyncratic way. Richard Kelly seems to pursue in his movies his private obsessions, which surely can go deeply wrong, but which nonetheless is the presupposition of anything interesting happening at all.",2008
10,"I'm just gonna go right out and say it. Richard Kelly's visionary epic ""Southland Tales"" is one of the best movies of 2007 and one of the most unique films ever created. However, to my (and yours as well) dismay, any attempt to synopsize this film would be an almost impossible task.",2008
10,"I was very disappointed to learn that this movie was only going to have a limited showing in the US, only one or two theaters on either coast. My wife and I both enjoyed ""Flags"" and were pleased when we learned that Clint Eastwood made a second movie, this time telling the story from the Japanese perspective. As luck would have it, we going to Japan for the holidays so we decided to try and see the movie in Tokyo during our trip. We went to the Ginza area of Tokyo and, to our surprise, the movie was completely sold out. We needed to buy tickets at least one day in advance. Further, we learned that the movie was currently number 1 in Japan. Wow ¬ñ that's impressive that an American made movie would become number one in Japan! Way to go, Clint! After a little extra planning and some adjustments to our schedule, we bought advance tickets and came back the next day.",2007

Their general speaks English, so he begins talking to this soldier, whose name we later find out is Sam. Although the two men should be sworn to kill each other, they are able to have a connection in the one conversation they have. A while later, the general comes back into the room only to discover that Sam's wounds have killed him. He searches him for a while and discovers a letter written by his mother. The letter is full of words that truly come from the heart of this kid's mother, and by the time the general finishes reading the letter, every soldier in that cave has realized that Americans aren't these savages; these hate-driven murderers. No, they all realize that Americans are exactly like they are, and that they don't want to be there and want to return home safely just like their enemies. I believe the point that Clint Eastwood is making with his Iwo Jima saga is just this: these two enemies were far more alike than they had imagined and they were both fighting only in hopes of returning home safely to their family. ",2006
10,Don't listen to the people who call this movie inaccurate or revisionist history.,2007
10,I have watched this film twice already this week (first week of release here in Japan). I am an American living in Japan for the past twenty two years and have yet to see such a strong performance from an (almost) all-Japanese cast. This movie draws you into the caves and makes you a part of the Japanese soldier's life. The main characters all have an interesting story to tell. But in the end the message is clear. War is futile.,2006
9,"It was worth it for producer/director Clint Eastwood to tackle on a second part to his now two-part duo of Iwo Jima movies. With Flags of Our Fathers Eastwood tried for very ambitious ground in covering what it's like for Americans to fight a war worth fighting for but with life's value undermined in the scope of preserving the 'grander' scheme of things like the flag on the mountain. Unfortunately, the screenplay with that film was also muddled and denied Eastwood's usually assured hand as a storyteller and conveyor of proper moods. But with Letters From Iwo Jima, a slightly radical departure from the usual American-directed war picture by showing the action totally from the side of the ""other"", there's a stronger sense of what it meant for the Japanese to fight this war, and the nature of sacrifice and what it means to oneself in relation to one's society, national pride, and to one's mind-set. And, this time, the screenplay doesn't do TOO MUCH of a jumping-around method with the narrative. It's visceral in scope and personal in tone, and there's always an assured hand in dealing with the performances and characters.",2007
9,"The companion film to ""Flags of Our Fathers"" shows the battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese point of view. Starting with the building of fortifications, hiding from relentless bombardment, and fending off an equally strong attack as American troops land on the island.",2006
10,"Not since Akira Kurosawa's ""Rash√¥mon"" has anyone attained such exquisite insight into the human condition, having read ""Flags of our Fathers"" and growing up, having veterans tell me of their experiences on Iwo Jima,I would look back at them in awe at the fact that they were here sharing their very own story,and many times they to could not believe they were alive.It is amazing to see the sensitivity that Mr.Eastwood imbued into both tales. The scriptwriter Iris Yamashita brought me to tears only at the end of the film with the conundrum we still live with today.Peoples dreams are both sacred and profane and lives are cheap.",2006
10,After much anticipation I was finally able to see Letters from Iwo Jima. I had left Flags of Our Fathers with a smile on my face saying now that was a great war film and it would be hard to match. Letters from Iwo Jima not only matches Flags of Our Fathers but also surpasses it and went on to tie Saving Private Ryan as the greatest war film I have ever seen. I sat numbed after viewing this film and look forward to watching it again.,2007
10,"This movie is so good. Probably even great. Like other movies it shows the horrors of war. Letters From Iwo Jima gives a real genuine feeling too it. You really feel scared for all the characters involved. By no means is it stating something new by showing the negatives of war but what it does have that other anti-war movies don't show well. It is realistic more than anything, it shows the past lives of the soldiers briefly yet it feels like you know so much about the character. This movie is the Platoon of this decade.",2008
9,"My family went to the movies every week back in the 1940's when I was a young kid. Before each movie there was a newsreel. One newsreel which made an indelible impression on me contained footage of the battle on Iwo Jima. It showed terrifying images of U.S. soldiers using flamethrowers, aiming them in the caves the Japanese soldiers had hidden in. When a Japanese soldier ran from the cave, his hands up, his whole body engulfed in flames, the audience in our theater applauded and cheered. I was horrified and have never forgotten the awful feeling I had then. I was only nine.",2007
10,"Because my late father fought on Iwo Jima, I have always been a student of the battle. I've studied the character and tactics of General Kuribayashi since elementary school and Eastwood's film and Ken Wanatabe's portrayal have embodied every notion I ever had of the general. I loved ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and plan to own it when it becomes available, but ""Letters"" is a better film. In spite of the English subtitles, ""Letters"" flows on screen more evenly than ""Flags"" and exhibits an equal dose of individual human emotions. The plight of the individual soldier in war is universal regardless of the evil or good his leaders exhibit. While some soldiers are unusually cruel, most just want to go home in one piece. This film teaches that beautifully.",2007
9,"At the conclusion of the film a person behind me said, ""Incredible,"" twice. Another person followed with, ""A masterpiece."" I would concur. Perhaps it isn't a perfect film but it is a movie with great impact.

9,"I know Flags of our Fathers sort of went out with a whimper and wasn't entirely well received by critics and audiences despite the hype and anticipation after Eastwood's last string of movies, but I personally liked it ¬ñ a lot, even. I thought it was a brilliant study of heroism in wartime as the American people see it as opposed to what true heroism in the immediate reality of the battlefield. It served both as an intricate study of the affects of post-war heroism as imposed on three people just because they lifted a flag, and also as a detailed and fascinating account of US Army politics during World War II and a chronicling of the legendary battle on Iwo Jima and the subsequent media frenzy over the photograph taken there. I'll admit, though, the film suffered from some flaws, one major one being a total lack of deep and interesting characters, which in turn kept us the audience distanced from the events unfolding in the film. And then Eastwood hit us with his companion piece, Letters from Iwo Jima, which chronicles the same battle from the Japanese side. And with Iris Yamashita's beautiful and resonant screenplay, Eastwood makes up for all the flaws in the previous film and fills in the gaps ¬ñ If anything, Letters from Iwo Jima completes and deepens Flags of our Fathers, but also, and perhaps subsequently, improves upon it greatly.",2007

6,"Although I enjoyed Flags, it really is, to me, just a companion piece to Iwo, simply to show the battle from the American side.",2007
10,"Letters was brilliant. Letters was almost entirely in Japanese. Letters starred Japanese actors, including the excellent Ken Watanabe. But it was an American production, directed by Clint Eastwood. Set as a Japanese view of the invasion of Iwo Jima, it is the companion film to Flags of Our Fathers. Though Flags was very good, it seems like Eastwood got a better grasp of the setting when he shot Letters. The story was far more convincing, dark and moving. Letters captured the horrors and even boredom of warfare masterfully. The film worked best because it didn't gloss over the Japanese Bushido Code of Warfare, but it also didn't make you feel any less for the main characters. To me, it seemed that the mission of this film was to get western audiences to understand the Japanese view of the Second World War, without apologizing for it. Letters succeeded in this with magnificence and showed the true terror and hopelessness of the Japanese cause by the time the invasion of Iwo occurred and yet had a poetry to it. It was almost as if Eastwood channeled the spirit of the late master of Japanese film, Akira Kurosawa and directed more than a movie, he directed a bleak yet beautiful film. This film was more than just a war film, it was a work of art. It demonstrated the oneness of humanity in our most barbaric and tribal setting. Mr. Eastwood, this was your finest hour.",2007
10,"I'm trying hard to recall the war movies I've seen that offer a balance between the humanity and atrocity of two opposing sides the way ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" does, and I can't think of one. That is where the film excels, and if one has trouble calling it an anti-war movie, at least it's a pro-life one. The film surpasses Eastwood's tandem effort, ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" in my estimation, but then, they are two quite different films, even though they have the same historical battle at their core.",2007
10,"Usually we see American made films and they follow a certain pattern, while foreign films seem to us being from 'left field.' This film was more foreign, not because of sub titles and language, but of HOW it was made. We are seeing the characters though eyes that we are not used to seeing from. This is quite similar to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in how we are sympathetic to the principals.",2007
10,"Clint, you have done it again! Letters from Iwo Jima is a different war film that separates itself from any other war films that is a guaranteed terrific rating. In high school, I wrote a paper on Iwo Jima, it's a war that is very over looked, especially by Americans, all we mostly know is that Iwo Jima is known for the famous image of the American soldiers planting the American flag in victory. Unfortunately, due to the monstrous image that we have created of the Axies powers in WWII, I feel that we have overlooked their history as well, Letters from Iwo Jima captured the ""in the other person's shoes"" perspective perfectly.",2007
4,"When I first heard that a movie is going to be made by the book ""Eragon"" by Christopher Paolini, I must say I was very delighted, and I was even more delighted when I heard that Stefen Fangmeier will be the director. I have read the book, and thaught:""What a great movie this is going to be"". Unfortunately, I was wrong. First of all, I would dare to say that half of the events that happened in the book weren't shown in the movie at all(reason: Lord of the Rings has less then 400 pages and the movie lasts around 3 hours; Eragon has around 500 pages and it lasts around hour and a half). As a result, instead of complexed, unpredictable fantasy plot you get simple, one-way heading fairy tale. Characters that play very significent role in book(like Murtagh, Ajihad and Angela) are hardly even mentioned in the movie, so that it becomes centered on pretty much only 3 characters-Eragon, Saphira and Brom. Villains and locations lack imagination, so they look cheap and ordinary. Choice of actors is, in my opinion, good, except Edward Speleers. There are way too much ""memorable quotes"" in the movie, so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody, from director to actors failed, but still, I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman, screenwriter. Although he had a fantastic material to work on, he managed to ruin it, and make a pathetic screenplay from a fantastic bestseller. Only bright side of the movie is always top-of-the-class John Malkovich(King Galbatorix), pretty solid performance by Jeremy Irons (Brom), but most of all dragon Saphira (voice by Rachel Weisz, whose vocal abilities are on very desirable level)",2006
1,"I tell my students to call it as they see it. If someone would be crushed by a scathing review, so be it. These Hollywood ""hotshots' need to get the hint that the public expectations for a true representation of a best-selling novel are more important that their ""artistic vision."" And when I say ""artistic vision,"" I mean stupidity and downright ignorance. Paolini's Eragon did not sell the way it did because it was merely some pulp fiction about a dragon; rather, it sold because it has a strong storyline, compelling characters, and timeless message. Not to mention that it was written by a 16 year-old boy.",2006
2,"I saw this with a friend of mine over the weekend in a press screening and I really did not enjoy it. The special effects are fine but the story is rather hammy and the performances are not very good. The main character looks like a deer in head lights most of the time and the villains acts like cartoon stereotypes more than real characters. Most of the characters here seem like rejects from other films and it shows by how unoriginal they were. The only performance in the film that has any credibility what so ever is the dragon Saphira and that's mainly because she is voiced by Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz, who has more talent in her vocal cords than all the actors working in this film combined.",2006
6,"The movie follows nothing of the book's plot line. I think someone read like maybe ten chapters of the Eragon book and decided to make the movie. If they decide to make Eldest (The sequel to Eragon) it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters (the ones they actually decided to add) share no similarities to the book's idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn't had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom, Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie, Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three (and Nasuada doesn't say who she is) and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book, you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn't supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira's wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing. Bottom Line: Could have been a great and timeless movie. Not Lord of the Rings worthy.",2006
1,"I voted 1 out of 10 (awful). First of all I must say that I loved the books and i'm looking very forward to the 3rd and know about the end of the trilogy. Now about the movie... Much like Harry Potter's, which is a story that I loved (I've read each boom about 20 times) I got very disappointed. The books were great, the movies were awful and are going from bad to worst. About ""Eragon"", the only thing I like in this movie was the special effects, even though Saphira does look to have feathers in it's wings. After reading such a great story in Eragon's pages I was looking forward to watch this piece of art... now i realized it's nothing more than a piece of crap. Bad acting, to much of the initial story cut, and way too many invented parts. The only part I really liked was the fresh-born Saphira. The movie really nothing to do with Paolini's excellent written and imagined story. Sorry folks, but I think the best way to improve is receiving critics and learning from our mistakes. Try to read ""Lord of the Rings"" and watch the respective movie, and try to get the differences on it...",2006
2,"First of all, the movie starts with Arya and the egg. But the narrator explains about who she is which eliminates the whole mystery of her character right off. There was no character development at all. Eragon is totally downplayed in the beginning and Roran is there and then just gone. Brom was portrayed as a cranky old man instead of the compassionate story teller. I must say though, that Saphira's period of growth was clever and Saphira, herself, was fantastic. But, none of the characters had personality. Speaking of the characters' personality, it wasn't ALL the screenwriters fault. What was with Ed Speelers? His rendition of Eragon lacked substance. The battles were immensely cut short. SOOOOOOO much was cut out of the book. And for people with children, it should be rated PG-13 because the battles were pretty graphic and the Ra'zac were really creepy looking. ",2006
1,"Crude, unimaginative adaptation of Christopher Paolini first novel is a bad joke from top to bottom. The screenplay is a joke, with major characters missing from the original novel and the acting from almost everybody in the film is down right horrible and that's really because most of the roles are miscast to begin with. Jeremy Irons makes an grant effort with what he has to work with but he's let down by the script and the bad performances of his co-stars and the only solid piece of real acting comes from the voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who gives the dragon Saphira enough charm, charisma, and strong will to make her the only believable and likable character in the entire film. That's in itself a great accomplishment considering the fact that script really does not even try to do that with itself.",2006
2,"How to describe a movie based on a lovely book, that could have had a wonderful franchise, but was so hurriedly done, and so poorly directed as to become a horrible flop? First lets say that while the book has some flaws, this movie is really a disservice to it; a more or less complex plot is reduced to its bare elements making it a very predictable ordeal (as any other story would), the photography doesn't reach the standard set by LOTR or HP, becoming quite bland, the casting -while good on the stronger characters (Brom, Durza, Galbatorix)- is really lacking, particularly on critical characters like Murtagh and Arya, and the music -so critical to convey the emotions of the movie- is so corny and clumsily placed that rather than enhance takes away from the experience. So little works on this movie and so many details are ruined using the cheapest tricks, that any sequel would never make it to the big screen (more so when critical plot points were stripped from the movie).",2006
7,"Let me start by saying I didn't read the books before seeing the movie but I am reading Eragon now. I enjoyed the movie. Not great but not bad. One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie (hopefully the DVD will have more added in). The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers, he had no presence in this movie, which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character, but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK. If you have read the book assume it is a coincidence that the movie and characters share names.",2006
1,"Paolini's novel should have been left alone. It was unnecessarily tampered with to make it into a lack-luster movie losing all magic, motivation, and meaning. The writers, director, and producers missed a real opportunity to make this into a great trilogy experience...perhaps they should have read the books first because they were much better than this. Get better actors and get a better director and you will have something. My advice...produce the movie again . We will forget the first attempt and bring back Rachel Weisz who made the dragon the best part of the film and it will be a better film. If you do that, it will succeed.",2006
2,"This movie was so horrible.It was NOTHING like the book and it skipped so many important parts.The acting was not that good except Jeremy Irons(Brom) and Rachel Weiz(Saphira) but a lot of the lines were corny and made no sense.They also made really important characters in the book minor roles in the movie.Then there were parts in the movie that didn't make sense and they didn't even explain why or how it happened.For example there is one part in the movie where Eragon(Speleers)is trying to get baby Saphira(Weiz) to fly.So he throws her up into the air and then when she comes down she is full grown and bigger than a house.I checked and that was NOT in the book.It was just depressing.So my advice is if you is that if you really want to see this movie wait till it comes out on DVD or video.I hope before they make the sequel ""Eldest"" they will try to write a good screenplay,get more experienced actors to play the lead characters(Ed Speleers for example),make it longer, and don't take only a few months to make it.",2006
1,"My sister recently watched this film after reading and enjoying the books. From the ""comments"" I heard while she she was watching she seemed very disappointed in the quality of the acting and the fact that the plot was very different from the books.(If you do not want to know anything about the film do not read on.)For example the film makes out Eragon is in control of the dragon when in the book he is not and does not have details such as dragons fire is the same colour as the dragon.Some of the characters and places in the book were also missed out. For people who have not read the books or have no intention to read them the film seems good in its own right but for anyone who enjoys the books watching the film may be a frustrating experience. I advise anyone wanting to watch Eragon to read the books instead.",2007
1,"Really Bad. If you read the books, do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through the agony of sitting through this travesty. The story line (which skips about 70% of the original story line) wanders miles from the novel. Except for Rachel Weisz's great voice over work for the dragon (which is the best acting this film has) the acting from the rest of the actors is just above high school play level. What were Jeremy and John thinking in taking these roles? The special effects are decent but that's it and the sets are cheesy Save your cash and wait for the third novel.",2006
1,I hope i never witness a sequel to this truly abysmal story. It seems like the whole film was put together in a couple of days. The script was dreadful and the acting not much better. When Jeremy Irons dies half way through he must of gave a sigh relief (at least he won't be in the sequel). The Film: A boy (Eragon) of 17 finds a dragon egg which hatches and becomes full sized in a day. The boy has special powers and rushes headfirst into everything without thinking but manages to survive everything thrown at him. None of the characters have any feeling felt towards them it's as if they are wooden characters. You don't really care what happens next. The finale is focused on a dragon fight with a raging battle fought beneath (which you don't see much of). The boy and his Dragon win (I don't know how) and it finishes as such that we will probably see the afore mentioned sequel. I say again what a terrible film trying to be Lord of the Rings but more like Bore of the rings.,2007
7,"Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young farmer who discovers an egg one day. When the egg hatches, out pops a baby dragon who the human learns is his dragon, and that he is a Dragon Rider. Through the inevitable growing pains of child to youth, youth to adult, young Eragon is mentored by a former dragon rider, Jeremy Irons, and learns that dragons and their human rider are bound together by a shared destiny until death. How they choose to live this partnership is the gist of the story as Eragon seeks to save his country from an evil ruler and magician with the help of a band of rebel outcasts, a magic sword, and the brave dragon. Of course, a young beautiful girl, Sienna Guillory is the first love of Eragon, and the partnership of Safira, the dragon and her rider becomes a life's test of courage, cunning, and growing wisdom.",2007
6,"ERAGON was not this totally disgusting movie that you should avoid. It is a very massive rip-off of LOTR and Star Wars (but everyone already knows that); yet it does have a certain level of charm, and the last quarter of the film is quite exciting.",2006
8,Let's pretend for a moment I didn't read the book: ,2006
1,"I really hope, for the sake of the young author, the book is nothing like this movie. This movie stinks. The no talent ass clowns that put it together suck. They should be ashamed of themselves. Let me start with Peter Buchman. The guy is a second rate hack. Look, I'm no ""every day"" critic, but maybe, just maybe, hiring the guy who crafted Jurassic Park 3 was a really, really bad idea. Buchman needs to find a different trade, cause he writes like a bull-whore with a shovel up her ass.",2007
1,"So... there's cute little Saphira flying through the clouds, then ZAP!!! She's full grown!!! As soon as that happened I knew the movie was ruined. Here is a list of even more things wrong with this pathetic Hollywood adaptation of a great novel (i.e. every Stephen King novel made into a movie with the exception of The Stand): 1. Saphira instantly grows up while flying around.",2006
7,"As I went to see Eragon, my expectations were very high, as I loved the book. The movie itself is action filled and well played (exept by Joss stone... which was just ridiculous)but something is missing. I think the directors made a bad choice to exclude some of the (I think) important factors in the book. Eragon's training, the Kull, Brom's death, the Dwarfs (Which were almost non-existent except for Hrothgar.... who was as tall as a human, and lastly the fight in Farthen D√ªr. I had hoped for a more epic, battlefield-ly kind of battle, instead of the cramped scenes that were made. I had also hoped for a more intense fight between Brom and the Ra'zac, and Eragon and Durza in the heart of Farthen D√ªr. I can only hope that the Ra'zac will have the role in Eldest that they do in the book. Regarless, the movie was good, the effects were beautiful (I admit, I had feared what the Urgals and Saphira would looked like :)) The film, sadly, looks like its been kinda rushed, and I think they should've taken the time to film at least half an hour more (the movie is at about 2 hours). Nonetheless, as a fan of Eragon, I enjoyed the movie, and I think that all fans should go see it, if not for the story, for the intense action :) Have fun!",2006
3,"It was just like watching Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope all over again, except this time, we have a dragon. The plot is basically the same, stupid farm boy finds out he has special powers in world torn apart by an evil emperor. even the other characters are the same. we have the obi-wan, Leia, Han, Vader, etc. and this was actually based on a book. I hope George Lucas sued the author. what's the next one gonna be called if they make a sequel, ""Eragon Episode 5: John Malkovich Strikes Back""??? Anyway on to the actual movie ""qualities."" This has a lot of great actors to include John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Djimon Hounsou. Somehow they all managed to put in career worst performances. The only good acting was from Rachel Weisz, probably because she didn't appear in the movie, just her voice for the dragon. On to music now! The soundtrack was actually good, because if you play it while watching ""Star Wars,"" it will eerily fit like Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' with ""The Wizard of Oz."" Amazing!! Now the effects were good when it concerned the dragons, otherwise they were unimpressive. That is why I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1. There are a lot of other connections to ""Star Wars"" of course, so even if I write them down, I still won't have to put a spoiler warning, because I wouldn't be giving anything away, unless you never seen ""Star Wars"" of course.",2007
2,"I was expecting the movie to leave out portions of the book. I did not expect the ""director"", Stefen Fangmeier to change the book. All in all the director ruined this movie...I have been waiting for this movie for 2 years. I had great expectations and when I left the theater I felt cheated and disappointed. I expected more from him. The entire movie jumps around and I often wondered how they got from point A to point B. There were people who had not read this book in the audience and in the lobby they were wondering about the characters and the plot. They also felt as if something was missing. The movie was only 104 minutes long...they could have made it longer and resolved some of the storyline problems.",2006
1,"Horrible and very funny adaptation of the popular children's book that plays like a bad SNL skit that is trying to parody ""The Lord of the Rings"" than the book that it's based on. The screenplay is a major mess with dialog that even little kids would find stupid and the performances are almost all laughably bad. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich should be ashamed of themselves for even agreeing to be in this film and Djimon Hounsou should start reading his scripts a little more carefully. The only redeeming thing about this crappy film is the great voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give the dragon Saphira more talent and range in terms of solid acting than all the human actors working in the film. The C.G.I work done for Saphira was also well done, making her more lifelike than her human co-stars as well. ",2006
1,"There is certainly something for everyone in this movie. That is, something for everyone to absolutely detest. Personally, I was struck by the horrid acting in this movie. The main characters all seemed to be warming up for the day of shooting in the shots chosen. They're characters were one dimensional at best and 9 times out of 10 they weren't even remotely believable. The best acting came from a poorly CGIed dragon with the completely unbelievable voice of Rachel Weisz.",2006
1,"If you didn't read the book, and saw the movie, you would say ""it was OK... but think it could have been 10x better"" If you read the book and then saw the movie you would say ""OH MY GOD! THEY TOOK A GOOD BOOK AND TOTALLY KILLED It, WHERE IS THAT WRITER!?!?! I WANT TO CHOKE EM!"" Yeah, its that bad. OK I read Eragon and I ate it up like a lion who didn't have breakfast. Then I saw the movie. And I feel bad for the author. (i forgot his name) I was afraid this would happen. And it did. I could tell from the trailer that they had already screwed everything up. Like I said if you read the book don't see the movie, so if you didn't read it, you don't know how badly they took a fine story and chew it up, sallowed it, and threw it up.",2006
5,"Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case, even fictional, will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course, I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case, but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.",2006
1,"""The Black Dahlia"" is a long, bloated, confusing, self-important, self-consciously artsy movie undermined by miscasting, absurd plot turns, naive symbolism, an utter disdain for history and laughable overacting that make Robert Towne's ponderous, plodding ""Chinatown"" sequel, ""Two Jakes"" (1990), look like a taut thriller.",2006
1,"How many producers does it take to screw up a movie? In the case of The Black Dahlia it takes 21 ""producers"". I counted the credits to be sure. I guess all 21 producers didn't notice how phony the flame bars were in the opening fire scene. The only producer with any real credits is Art Linson. Perhaps what this film needed was a single producer, director, writer team that could focus on the story. And how about that acting? Johanson was miscast as was Swank (although Swank is generally a good actress in other films). The plot is convoluted beyond anyones general concept of the Black Dahlia story. I was told that this film was a real disappointment by my friends who saw it in a theatre, so I watched it on DVD and almost walked out of my own living room. On the positive side, the photography, production design and the music were acceptable. But is it just me or does most of the dialog sound like clich√©s from other film noir films? As others have pointed out this wanted to be L.A. Confidential or Chinatown, but came off as a poor imitation. To bad as I really wanted to love it...",2007
7,"It has been almost ten years since Curtis Hanson delivered what was arguably the best picture of 1997, L.A. Confidential. That movie was great in almost every way (my key dislike was only in the performance of Kim Basinger, yet the Academy did not agree with me), and a big part of that was due to the source material from James Ellroy. And now comes The Black Dahlia, another one of Ellroy's books based on detectives in the 1940's, only revolving around a real event and having master filmmaker Brian De Palma at the helm. And unfortunately, the film comes with mixed results.",2006
7,"Dante Ferretti's set design beautifully evokes the 1940's; Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography enhances the period look; and the voice-over narration has been pulled from film-noir classics. While Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" has much of the look and feel of Curtis Hanson's 1997 ""L.A. Confidential,"" that far superior film boasted better performances and a well-written screenplay. Although both films were based on James Ellroy novels and both had complicated, involved plots, the Hanson film came together with satisfying logic. Unfortunately, De Palma's movie is equally if not more complex and leaves a few threads dangling or at least badly frayed.",2006
2,"I wanted to love it, but Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" is a flat, paceless, uninvolving, constipated bore. It bears few of the director's signature set pieces, and possesses none of the energy of classics like ""Body Double"". ""Dressed To Kill"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Scarface"". Based on the rambling, seedy novel by James Elroy, which I read and enjoyed very much over a decade ago, this filmization of the novel fails in its casting, structure and set design. Although the film's period Los Angeles has all the trappings of ye olde Hollywoodland, it looks like a movie set. Josh Hartnett is totally unconvincing in his central role, as is the highly masculine Hillary Swank as a ""femme fatale"" (give me a break! she belongs in an Almodovar movie!) who sucks Hartnett into a convoluted web and her unappealing mouth. Scarlett Johannsen, who looks ravishing in a shot or two, is weak as water, and owns little screen presence. The narrative is unbelievably matter-of-fact and most of the film's surprise ""revelations"" are plain silly. More conservative critics have focused on the film's ""sleaze"" and ""trashiness"". If ONLY there was more sleaze and trash. This is lightweight film noir that will will send most viewers back to the video store to rent the DVD of ""LA Confidential"", an excellent adaptation of another Elroy novel. This turgid celluloid clunker is something I will soon forget.",2006
4,"Brace yourself for some real truth. As you noticed on IMDb, this movie was advertised as ""Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller"". The trailer makes the movie look the same. Unfortunately, if you go to this movie with that in mind, you may and should be disappointed. When I see the genre described as it was, I want to see just that. Oh, you can add comic relief, maybe good music, some reasonable horror and nostalgia, but do not do what was done to The Black Dahlia.",2006
5,"Yes, all of it and more. The images are beautiful but what a mess. I don't need to understand what's going on if, at least, I'm entertained. Look at The Big Sleep for instance. There will never be another ""Chinatown"" I'm afraid, regardless of what Mr Ellroy thinks. The one element that sees you through this inconsequential mess is Josh Harnett's face. At times he looks as confused as I did and just as annoyed. Who can blame him? Hilary Swank, what was she doing? She looked like Vampyra's sister, the boring one. What a catastrophic piece of casting. And Fiona Shaw? If the film had been all like her performance the flick could have had a chance at the campiest ""noire"" ever put on film ever. But not such luck. All this said and done, it's a De Palma movie and that counts for something. Black Dahlia is certainly better than Snake Eyes but as a De Palma fan I felt terribly let down.",2006
1,"Ah, I should have listened to my sister, she warned me not to see this movie. But my friends actually literally dragged me, they had to bribe me with a free movie ticket, but still I will be honest, I went in with an open mind. After all, people have different tastes, may I say that I thank my friends, I feel so much better having an extra $9.50 in my pocket after seeing this crap.",2006
1,"I never post reviews, ever, and I make the exception for this movie because it was so bad and so many people seem to like it. I gave it a 1, but I'd give it a 0 if I could.",2007
8,"Having read so many negative reviews, I started doubting my own rating for a minute, but no, I will rate this above average. It may not much for people knowing what the Black Dahlia murders were all about or that read the book, but for a movie, it was good.",2007
1,"My wife and I went to see it yesterday with another couple. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in years (all 4 of us agreed). Two hours of torture. Hard to believe it came from Brian DePalma, or anyone else for that matter. ""The Black Dahlia"" manages to combine all of the right ingredients for a supreme stinker: 1. A confusing story line. It's supposed to be about a murdered women, the Black Dahlia, but there are so many confusing, unnecessary sub-plots going on, they forgot about the subject of the movie. 2. Bad writing. The dialogue was so bad it seemed like a parody of movies from the 1940's, with the corny dialogue, only exaggerated. It's as though Saturday Night Live wrote the script for a 10-minute skit, but stretched it into 2 hours. You can't believe how bad it is. 3. Wooden acting. I guess if you have a terrible script, even the best actors can't do much with it. Most of the actors try to copy the style of dialogue from the 1940s, which would be fine if we were in the 1940s, but this is 2006. There was one scene with a woman which was supposed to be serious, but it was so pathetically over-acted that people in the audience started laughing. Ouch! Save your money.",2006
1,"As much as I mourn the fact that my first review is an egger, I feel it my civic duty to warn the populace of this dreadful reel. I'll keep it short and succinct, as I do not take pleasure in bashing anything that at least assumes itself to be something artistic.",2006
1,"This movie would not have been so bad if it were not for the high rating. It was said to be wonderful, so when you saw the movie you were hoping it would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately it was a huge waist of three hours! Not only was it too long but also the scenes dragged on for way too long as well. Two hours of that movie could have been taken out and not even that would have saved this movie. Personally I found the directing to be horrible. Pointless gore and overly done sex scenes made the movie almost comical for me. The movie was not gripping, moving, or even entertaining. Overall the movie was three miserable hours that I will never get back.",2006

3,"In 1947 at the age of 22, Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress, was found murdered in a vacant lot in Los Angeles. Her body had been severely mutilated and cut in half at the waist. The case was nicknamed ""The Black Dahlia"" by newspaper reporters seeking to capitalize on the then-popular movie ""The Blue Dahlia"" which was enjoying its theatre run at the time.",2006

1,"When I put my money down at the box office to see ""The Black Dahlia"", I foolishly thought the film was going to be about ""The Black Dahlia"". Silly me. If you are looking for an unbelievably slowing moving Harlequin Romance between Josh Harnett and Hilary Swank filled with... well, a whole lot of ""filler"" - with the story of ""The Black Dahlia"" as a very distant backdrop, then this is the film for you. Fiona Shaw did turn in an excellent comedic performance at the dinner table, but was too over-the-top for words in her final soliloquy. There was one really cool shot of Josh Harnett in the bathroom - cinematically interesting, using mirrors to place him in three positions on the screen at one time - but not worth $8.75 and the $2.00 parking.",2006
1,"This movie could have been called absolutely anything. It shouldn't, however, have been called ""The Black Dahlia."" If your going to base a story on real events then there should be at least some similarities to the truth! This movie had no connection to any real events at all (The real life victim never made a film of any kind, porn or otherwise.) And, the fiction story that was presented was not all that enthralling. It is often said that truth is stranger than fiction, which is certainly true in this case. A story based on the real story of the Black Dahlia could have made an excellent movie. But they chose to create a total fiction with no basis in fact at all. I felt ripped off by this Black Dahlia impostor!",2006
8,"Being a James Ellroy-disciple the knowledge of an adaption of the terrific novel filled me with a combination of fear and expectation: Fear... can it ever be as great as the book? Expectation... Curtis Hanson did an excellent job with L.A. Confidential, so why not? - And now I've seen the result of DePalma's work. First of all, don't even compare it with the L.A. Confidential movie. Black Dahlia is told in a radical different way, being much more synthetic, expressive and theatrical. This is not a very common way of telling stories in modern movies, however this method made me recall the typical 'over-acting' as seen in the 40's noir movies (like Double Indemnity). Was this intentionally? - Probably, yes. It feel a bit weird to begin with, but at the end of the show I had to admit: It works. The movie clearly tries to describe all the details from the book, which sometimes makes it loose its own breath. The original story had so many details, and took place over a very long period of time. This is one of the points where the movie sometimes stumble. It's simply trying too hard. One thing that is hard to criticize is the stunning visuals. The movie is absolutely beautiful, making every scene a work of art. The other highly successful point I would have to mention is Hilary Swank. She IS a femme fatale, by definition. Fans of the classic film-noir genre will most likely be more than satisfied. Keep a look-out for this one, and be ready to be thrilled.",2006
9,"I have only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks, talks, sounds, and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking, dark, very clever, and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative, overplayed, smoldering, overwhelming, cheesy, campy Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller (my favorite genres) with the evident elements of black comedy (the most favorite genre when it's done well). I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching, especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might have missed the first time. ""The Black Dahlia"" is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie; I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light, shadows, his combination of colors, black and gold - my favorite, his use of stairways, and the way we first are allowed to notice the body - it is Art, noir film made by an Artist. Besides, I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter 's song ""Love for Sale"" which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.",2007

Both of my kids really enjoyed the movie and I did as well. I thought the plot was good and the acting was pretty good as well. I liked the magical feel that this movie had and at least it lets kids use their imagination instead of just the same old boring stuff. How Aquamarine could ever have a lower user rating than Ultraviolet is a crime against humanity. I am glad that several of the user comments that I have read appreciate this movie for what it is, a movie for your kids and that the parents will enjoy also.",2006
10,"As a parent, I found this movie an enjoyable way to spend time with my 9-year-old daughter and her friend. Here are her comments: ""I thought that Aquamarine was a great movie! I could really compare it to the Little Mermaid. You know, the parts where she had to leave before sunset. I thought that the cast did a really great job acting. I really liked the end, too."" Back to mom's thoughts: All in all, the friendship theme is very positive. Also, the ""love"" theme is appropriate for young viewers, in my opinion, because it was somewhat idealized but not over the top unimaginable. The feeling in general was of a pleasant escape where friendship is reaffirmed.",2006
9,"I was really surprised at the potential of this movie! I went expecting it to be another stupid poorly done fairy tale, but left thinking that it was so much more! The chemistry of Emma, Jojo, and Sarah is incredible, and it really is brought out in their acting. I never expected to see great acting out of emotions from them, but they made their feelings so real - which I never would've expected from them. thought a lot of any three of these actresses until now - but it was very good. If you go see this movie, expect to leave hoping that maybe one day you'll find a mermaid - it gives everybody a little taste of magic. Well done! Great for kids of all ages, I'm 12 and I liked it as much as my 7 year old sister.",2006
7,"I wanted to hate this movie. Everything from the constant squealing of ""Oh My God"", the stream of clich√©s and the sheer ridiculousness of some of the dialouge pointed in the direction of a complete waste of time. Somehow however, Aquamarine managed to win me over through charm and its child like determination to please. The movie centers around two teenage girls (Emma Roberts and JoJo) who are spending their last summer together before Hayley (Jojo) moves away to Austrailia. Their summer takes a surprising twist when they discover a mermaid (Sara Paxton) in a pool after a terrible storm. They spend the rest of the summer trying to help her find true love. Both Emma Roberts and Jojo are newcomers to the screen and do a surprisingly good job at playing bubbly girls without making the audience want to wring their necks 10 minutes in and though each have yet to develop their skills especially at showing a wide range of emotions, they certainly are charming and enjoyable to watch. Sara Paxton looks and talks the part and though this role wasn't one to exhibit any real acting abilities she embraces the part full on. Yes, Aqaumarine features a mean blonde girl and yes there is the ""hot"" guy but if you watch this movie for exactly what it is, a fluffy escape from life, then it shouldn't bother you. So if you are ever in the mood, wait until it comes out on video and don't pay 10 dollars on it, it is definitely a rental.",2006
8,"Even though I was forced to watch this with younger siblings, I actually enjoyed myself. Besides the movie Splash which was made years ago, I don't think there has been many mermaid movies. This one, although a little bit on the cheesy side, had a pretty good underlying message. Graphics were not extraordinary, but they weren't terrible. Jojo turned out to be a sarcastic, funny actress and Sara Paxton did a pretty good job on being the clueless mermaid. Emma Roberts was a little bit rusty on acting, but she can sure tear up. Yea it was cheesy, but what'd you expect, at least it wasn't unbearably cheesy. It was really just cute and I enjoyed watching it with my siblings.",2006
10,"I saw this movie yesterday and I thought that it was very entertaining. Aquamarine is a truly excellent family flick! Even though I'm a 24-year old young man, this film appealed to me a whole lot. I am often very fond of films that revolve mainly around female characters. The girls featured here are all very cute, especially Sara Paxton, the actress who portrays the title character.",2006

5,"I promised my sister I would take her to a movie for her birthday and buy her popcorn a few weeks ago, and today was the day we settled on. I was pushing for Failure to Launch or She's the Man, but my sister was determined to see Aquamarine. So fifteen dollars later we were all nestled in. The movie starts off extremely slow and was, in my opinion, painful to watch. I must admit I was much more entertained with thinking of ways that I could sneak in to The Hills Have Eyes, which was playing at the theater across from ours. But in the end I stayed for the movie, giving me plenty of time to think over my criticisms. I think Emma Roberts (timid and diminutive Claire) may be a rare star who started out acting fairly well and is getting worse. I thought her early Unfabulous days were good, but now I can barely stand to watch the show. Her over-the-top mugging drives me insane. I wasn't expecting much out of JoJo (bold and strong Hailey) at all. I knew it wasn't exactly fair writing her off for being a singer, but that's what I did. And I was extremely, pleasantly surprised. She did a great job, I thought. I wasn't expecting much from Sara Paxton (the titular mermaid Aquamarine) judging by the painful ""I see we're going to have to take this slow: Mer Maid"" in the trailers, but she ended up doing okay. All in all, it wasn't a great movie, but it picks up in the second half and finishes well, so it was a pretty decent way to spend almost two hours on a cold Saturday afternoon. Although next time, I think I'll pick the movie.",2006
9,"I went to see this movie with a few friends. Lets just say, it was unanimous, we loved it! All the actors and actresses in the movie were portraying their characters realistically, even Sara Paxton's character as a mermaid! And, dang is Ray FINE! Haha. The movie just had some certain quality about it that really appealed to me and my friends. Although some people gave it a review saying it was childish, its for KIDS! WE loved it and it also had a similar message as The Princess Bride. True love can mean more than anything else. It was funny, sweet and light-hearted. You might not want to bring young kids though. it was really fun to watch, and we had a great time, and if I saw this movie as an adult, it might have been a bit girlish, yeah, but girls will love it like heck!",2006

They are always young, beautiful and completely naive. Some classic films have captivated this obsession. The first biggest and most memorable film was the classic 1984 comedy ""Splash"" which really brought the myth back into the fore-front of our minds. Next was 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"" which stole our hearts and re-launched Disney's animation division.",2006
10,"Hilarious. A movie the whole family would enjoy. Even the adults will love it. Good story line, and besides the whole mermaid thing, it has several aspects that most girls (and some guys) can relate to (first crush, best friend moving away, evil preppies, dad trying to run child's life, fear of something you once loved, etc). Once again, very amusing, original, and an all around ""I need to own"" movie. I would recommend it to mostly everybody, most guys (especially teenagers or single guys) might not appreciate most of the humor in it. However, I think that (almost) every girl (young and old) will be delighted with this movie. Definitely worth seeing at the theater.",2006

Remembering the display of ultimate mediocrity that was A Cinderella Story, one of the last movies we saw in the theater together, I was prepared to hate and be bored by this movie. That is to say, I went in expecting crappy dialogue, a predictable yet forced and contrived plot, and acting that ranged from mediocre to awful. Its having below a 3.0 on IMDb (compared to A Cinderella Story's 5.2) certainly didn't help matters.",2006

The things I like the most about this movie is that this is a girl movie. I am a young man, however, but that's exactly what a million other men like me love - chick flicks! For the ladies, of course! Unfortunately, there are no kicks, punches, or yells; no explosions; no car chases; nothing that is very actioney here. But at least this movie has a bunch of young ladies - enough to satisfy us men! ""Aquamarine"" is one movie that is perfect for all ages, and even if we are not ladies or young girls, this can be considered an excellent guy movie. I give this 10 out of 10 and you should do the same as well! Thank you very much!",2006

And being from Australia originally, its great to see a couple of Aussie actors in there for good measure. Its a great movie for girls, teens and their Mums, with lots of humor and lessons to learn. My daughters are 6 and 9 and I am in my 30's, and we all found something that tickled our funny bones, and lots we laughed at together. It was wonderful to sit in the cinema and watch the smiles on my girls faces, and twinkles in their eyes at the magic this movie holds. Go see it, if nothing else, you will leave with a lighter step, as it imparts a real sense of ""feel good"" and ""girlish-ness""",2006
7,"Aquamarine (2006) Starring Sara Paxton, Emma Roberts, JoJo, Jake McDorman, Arielle Kebbel, Claudia Karvan, Bruce Spence, Tammin Sursok, Roy billing, Julia Blake, Shaum Micallef..Director Elizabeth Allen I admit never having seen Splash, but if it's a lot like this film only set in an earlier decade like the 80's or something, I'm sure that film is not enjoyable. I've seen Mermaids with Cher and that was also awful. Continuing cinema's love affair with beautiful mermaids and the ""Little Mermaid"" story, Sara Paxton plays Aquamarine, a real-life mermaid who changes the lives of two best friends forever. Emma Roberts and Jojo play the two friends, who must deal with possible separation as one of the girl's mother is resolved to move out to Australia for a high-paying job as marine biologist. The two girls make a wish that something will keep them together. Aquamarine shows up and soon she changes the girl's lives, making them stronger, smarter and altering their status from unpopular girls to the girls everyone roots for. Arielle Kebbel plays the mean-spirited Cecilia, whose father is a wealthy news reporter and whose goal is to humiliate the girls. Aquamarine falls for the sexy, hunky California surfer dude boy Jake McDorman. The Little Mermaid story is now acted out in present time as he discovers her secret (she is a mermaid by night, and human by day) but still continues to pursue her romantically. Possibly, this film is terrible but for pre-adolescent girls and or younger, this is a real delight. The girls do learn a lesson in friendship and loyalty. Aquamarine learns that love is not merely romantic but platonic. These lessons aren't really delivered with enough power as this film is mostly comedy. But this film is enjoyable and has its own merit, even if it is predictable in ""Little Mermaid"" manner. But what story hasn't been told and retold ?",2006
10,Aqamarine is a wonderful movie. It is one of my favorite movies. It is about a mermaid and understanding what love really is. I had read the book when I was younger and I went to the movie expecting the book to have been better (as most books are). After I watched the movie I knew it was better than the book by far. They took a story and made it better on screen. I think everybody should see this movie and I think everyone would like it too. Children love this movie too because it contains a mermaid. All the people acting do a wonderful job and act it out very well. I have this movie and watch it often and I think if you watch it you will love it just as much as I do if not more.,2007
10,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Being in the time now where every movie contains sex or violence, seeing this movie was refreshing and it shows that you can make a great movie without having those things. I'm a huge fan of everyone in this movie and by being a teenage girl, these are the kinds of things I want to see in a movie. I hope there is a sequel to this, and many more movies to come that are heartwarming, special, and that makes you feel good. Jojo is a great actress and so are Emma Roberts and Sara Paxton. you can tell the kind of person that they all are and that they are genuine. I thought I was going to have a bias when I first began to watch the movie because I'm a HUGE Jojo fan, but anyone who watches this can tell that this is a really good movie. The acting is very good, it seems like it could happen in everyday life(except for the mermaid part, which they also made to seem so realistic). Movies like this should continue to be made and speaking from a teenage perspective, these are the kinds of movies we ALL need to be watching.",2006
9,I absolutely love this movie ! it was so great! i love how fairytaleish it is! it's so very very cute. the guy could've been cuter but he looked kind and stuff. Sara Paxton did a great job as did Aquamarine. Jojo and Emma Roberts did great too. I've watched this show twice and it confirms my want to be an actress.the plot kept you guessing what was going to happen.though the ending wasn't so great it wasn't as bad as some i've seen. Hailey and Claire and Aquamarine we a great pair of friends and them being together made you feel like you were in a pack of great friends too. Hailey moving and aquamarine leaving made me really sad. I didn't like that part but they did get kissed by Raymond!,2006
10,"This movie was nothing like the book....It was better! (No offense to the author) I am in love with mermaids, so when I heard about this film, I was so excited to see it. I was already obsessed with the movie's ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Little Mermaid II,"" and ""Finding Nemo,"" all taking place in the sea or from a fish's point of view. I watched the movie, already loving Emma Roberts as a singer. I also thought Jake McDorman was very cute! When I found out this movie was based on a book, I quickly went to the library and borrowed the book. I finished it in one day because it was really, really short. I didn't really enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed the movie. That says a lot, because I read the book ""Freaky Friday"" after I saw the movie, and I thought the book was better. I also read the book ""Harriet the Spy"" after I saw the movie, and I still thought the book was better, so I didn't like the movie better just because I saw it before the book. Also, I like Sara Paxton. I already saw her in the movie ""Sleepover,"" and then after I saw this movie, I saw Sara Paxton in ""Return to Halloweentown"" on Disney Channel. It's amazing how Sara Paxton has the ability to change characters in so many movies. If I didn't know already that Sara Paxton played someone in all three of these movies, I would have never guessed! Sara Paxton is such a good actress!",2006
7,"""Aquamarine"" seems the typical teen romantic comedy, and it is, but I'm not saying that this movie is bad, because is not. This movie is cute, funny and entertaining. It is a good comedy about friendship and love.",2006
10,"I recently purchased this DVD and found it to have great acting from young folks, as well as enough of a twist at the end to make it less than predictable. There are plenty of movies with less than stellar acting from the lilliputian world, that I feel confident to say that there is credibility in this cast. Apparently there does not seem to be a consensus along these lines, however.",2006
9,"Like the reviews overseas,Australian critics have generally snubbed this film as bland and contrived with some nasties regarding Russell's accent and wooden comedy delivery.",2006
7,"This is definitely the first time I have gone to see an Russell Crowe and/or Ridley Scott film at the cinema, fully bracing myself to be disappointed and...",2006
8,"A Good Year is much like Peter Mayle's other books ¬ñ shortish, picturesque, sometimes mouthwatering, generally light and definitely charming.",2006
7,Food tastes better there. The women are naturally beautiful. Walks are more romantic. Wine is more complex... but life is less so. France can turn good memories into grand ones. It replaces currency with passion. It replaces accumulation with appreciation.,2006
8,"A demographically mixed audience seemed to enjoy this film very much. The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra ""punch"" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love, trust, and friendships.",2006
9,"As a longtime fan of Russell Crowe, I do know that he can be funny, charming, sweet and romantic, not only on film but in real life. His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special ""effected"" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!",2006
8,I thought the movie was very good... Much better than I expected from the previews.,2006
8,"I enjoyed this movie, it had class and character with some lovely ladies. Also I enjoyed the London footage with the contrast against France. Crowe, I think did very well and I was surprised at the end because I didn't now it was a Ridley Scott movie. It would now be interesting to read the book to see how closely it is represented. All things seemed to fit, and it was evident in last encounter with Crowe and his French girl from the scene of when he was a boy at the pool. Great romantic portrayal of an English French relationship. The movie also maintained a good level of humour encased with good vocabulary. I had heard this was a good movie and am glad to able to cement that in words.",2006
10,"My breath was taken away as I was transported to another place entirely. It was so warmly sentimental I had tears in my eyes many times during the movie,, but in a great way. THis is what movies are meant to do, take us away and out of our ordinary lives to escape and step outside ourselves to reflect on some deeper meaning.",2006
8,"I had the chance to see this film during an early press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel, several weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised. A good friend of mine that came along was thrilled with the views and landscapes and caught up with the dramatic plot, despite having a distinct preference for action flicks. Speaking of which, here's a chance to give a little tip for the guys: although this is generally referred to as a ""chick flick"", the screen is filled with the presence of 2 beautiful women throughout the film. Watch out for the young Abbie Cornish (who appears in a brief nude sequence, so don't blink) and for the arousing french actress Marion Cotillard as Crowe's love interest throughout the film.",2006
8,"The American woman does not claim that the land is hers, but tries to know something about his past. Ridley Scott exploit his good taste to create a charming atmosphere, in which Russel Crowe is just an extra piece of the story. The landscapes, the Provence feeling, the interesting women, and the enchanting world of wine makes you fly between the clouds and wonder: ""what if I leave my job right now and start living the real life?"". Russel Crowe successes in playing a clumsy business man who realizes he has to make a change. Albert Finney minor appearances are brilliant. It is a movie about feelings, enjoying life, and finding yourself. You have to see it.",2006
8,"The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together, they made the award winning Gladiator, and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar. Here, they come together again for a pretty feel good movie, but I don't expect that this would win any major honours. Not that it's a bad film, but it's quite vanilla plain, that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold.",2006
10,"Thank you so much Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and company for a most delightful 2 hours. I guess I didn't watch the same movie as a lot of critics did but then I never do or very seldom do. I use to faithfully read the reviews when trying to figure out what to see but have been lied to and led astray by to many so I don't really read many now. They have sent me off to some of the most Godawful movies that I very seldom go at all now. I make up my own mind.I do make a point of going to all Russell Crowe movies as I know they will be high quality. Russell Crowe has wonderful comic timing and shows everything on that most expressive face of his and in his eyes. He doesn't miss a beat. Wonderful actor. Ridley Scott , magnificent director in bringing so many different worlds to us the lucky fans.",2006
1,"The only interesting thing about this film (in the tired genre ""Go-to- Provence/Tuscany-and-find-your-true-self"") is that it's done by Ridley Scott. Maybe even that isn't very interesting, but the man who directed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" will always prick up the ears of quite a number of people, expecting to see something at least vaguely resemblant of the talent in those films.",2010
4,"Watching this fantasy of cashing out to live a life of food, wine, sex and sunlit idleness in Provence, you don't suspend disbelief for a minute. Right at the outset we are shown that Russell Crowe's character is exactly what his beloved uncle calls him when he cheats at chess as a boy -- ""a little s**t."" Now grown up, he enjoys making money by cheating, not so much for the money, though that's nice too, but for the sheer pleasure of dominating others by being smarter, tougher and more ruthless than they are. Since, he's surrounded by agreeably available women in London (the movie tries to make a running joke of flashes and cleavage shots) it is clear that he needn't sleep alone. Nothing Crowe does makes us believe that he is less than perfectly satisfied with the life he leads, or that he would give it up to take up with a Provencal girl and contendedly guzzle home grown wine on the terrace. Nothing convinces that he and she are made for each other, or that she should see him as anything but a good looking rich foreigner who'll be an enjoyable but short-lived roll in the hay. Because Crowe's boss writes him a thumping severance check when he turns down a partnership and leaves the firm, his choice is too easy to be interesting. His buddy the real estate agent has it right. After six months he'll be bored to death, up to his ears in some financial shenanigan, and probably fooling around on his honey just to prove to himself that he can get away with it.",2006
5,"This movie is like a dream. Provence is always under the sun, peasants are poets, and people just have the good life, always drinking wine (without becoming alcoholic nor fat of course) and eating like kings... I forgot, waitresses are like goddess! But, reality check: in France, we have winters, autumn, ugly people... wine making is also a technical job, and even in Provence, we don't live like we are in 1946 !!!! So even if this movie is not so bad, I can assure you that it's full of clich√©s! I liked the part of the story which was about materialism, and choices you have to make in your life... but this film can't be a great one when it's based on the ""cliche"" that every french real estate man would like to provide to it's English customers.",2007
4,People said this was Under the Tuscan Sun. It had none of the charm. I didn't care about any of these characters. Every stereotype of the financial services industry and Provence. Done better elsewhere. The only person I liked was Crowe's assistant. The look wasn't even Provence. I lived there 5 years. It looked and mood was more like Spain. The writing was uninteresting. All this pompous morality about the vines. None of these people deserved to have things turn out well. Their issues disappeared with the wave of a hand. Crowe's love interest suddenly gets over her bitterness and suspicion after one night with Russell. I guess it was the superficiality that got to me. All problems resolved before the commercial.,2013
6,"The idea is nothing new. Ruthless city slicker (bond broker, of course) remembers his childhood and regains his soul in beautiful sunny Provence, where his uncle had this great vineyard.",2007
6,"The English critics have more or less blasted this new release unanimously but I went anyway. I'm lion-hearted. And you know, it wasn't too bad. Sure, it owes something to Avanti and Ridley Scott is no Billy Wilder and Russell Crowe is definitely no Jack Lemmon but Marion Cotillard, soon to be seen as Edith Piaf, is more than a match for Juliet Mills. In their wisdom IMDb omit five actors from the initial cast list so that you have to click 'more' to find out that Marion Cotillard, Abbie Cornish, Isabelle Candelier, Didier Bourdon and Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi are also part of the ensemble; leading lady and love-interest Cotillard is arguably the largest omission but Candelier and Bourdon offer huge support throughout, Abbie Cornish is the Californian who turns up looking for her father whilst Bruni-Tedeschi is an avocat. It seems to be a truth universally acknowledged that Russell Crowe doesn't do Charm and/or light comedy but hey, he gives it the old college try and with support like that mentioned it's not such a big deal. It's basically a feel gooder with some great scenery punctuated by some Judge and Andy Hardy lessons in life with Finney in the Lewis Stone role and Crowe as Mickey Rooney but the two hours really do fly by.",2006
2,"This movie manages to put together a truckload of stereotypes and a bunch of annoying characters, to deliver a conventional, Cinderella-worth happy ending.",2009
4,"A brash, bullying investment banker played by Russell Crow? Not what I would choose as a central character for a ""comedy"". This dreadfully unwitty film seems a very odd choice for director Scott and falls as dreadfully flat on it's face as Crow in the film's numerous ""hilarious"" prat-falls. Is there still a place for slapstick in the 21st Century? Discuss - an interesting title for some dreadfully pointless Film Studies course but if you ARE going to try slapstick then it really doesn't work when your protagonist is a nauseating....(insert obscenity here). When Crow falls from a diving board to land face first in an empty swimming pool, you find yourself very far from laughter but rather hoping that that might be shock end to the film. Broken neck. The End. ",2012
1,I really respect Ridley Scott but cannot understand why he uses Russell Crowe whose has only two expressions arrogant and conceited . This flabby little man Crowe shows his real pretentious character in playing a pretentious and snotty Merchant broker who inherits a property which has a vineyard. The film goes down hill from there . Drink plenty before you see this crappy film.,2008
3,"First, let me preface this comment with this statement: I love Russell Crowe. He is by far my favorite actor. So I rented this movie, even though the reviews are not the greatest. In fact, I saw Russell being interviewed about this movie, and he didn't even seem too impressed with it. (He's not one to put up a front).",2007
4,"This film does have beautiful scenery and a good supporting cast but that's about it. What I found annoying about the film was that it seems there are scenes that are supposed to be funny but are NOT. Speeding up the film and other cinematic tricks do not make a scene funny. And I was just not moved to laugh at the tired stereotypes of Frenchmen. I am not being PC - just bored. So the French are volatile, dirty and obsessed with wine and sex - so what - been there, done that - not funny. I saw this film with a friend who said Russell Crowe was ""out of his depth"". It seemed a strange comment as the film is just not very ""deep"" but I think I understand what she meant. Crowe was hot as a gladiator in a dramatic film, but in modern dress and a cute comedy he is just a stick. It would take an actor with a light touch and great personal charm to make me care about this contrived plot and believe the main character's transformation. Maybe Hugh Grant or, if you could go back in time, young Cary Grant could bring it off.",2006
8,"It's a great series that deserved more of a fighting chance. It's easy to understand the many ardent fans of the show, but hard to understand Jericho's failure to attract more viewers than it did. The show is engaging, to the point of being dangerously addicting and whatever it lacks (see below), that's more than made up for by a consistently inventive story expansion. The show moves seamlessly from the original premise of 'USA - post nuke' into much unexpected territory. There's some filler episodes, but barely a bum one. What hampers the series is that odd but inevitable 'dated' feeling that almost all network dramas fail to shake, even the minute they arrive on our screens. Dramas like this just can't live up to the HBO/AMC cannon because of the demands on them to, eg: appeal to a large audience and produce 22-ish episodes per series - it can be simply backbreaking. One can't help but imagine how much better this show could have been with a studio like HBO behind it. It certainly deserves more care, with which it might have not been cancelled. Nevertheless, the fact one can imagine Jericho's greater potential is a credit to the strength of both the inventive writing, the smart political commentary and the many well-drawn characters which shine through occasional soft-focus, feel-good, pre-watershed moments of schmaltz and sentimentality. Those moments are thankfully few, but there's enough to make you wish there were less. The cast are all very capable, particularly Skeet Ulrich, Lennie James and Gerald McRaney who lend the show its gravitas. Bring it back! 4/5",2010
8,"So often I lament the passing of quality broadcast commercial television and then something new, challenging, such as Jericho shows up.",2008
8,"I have watched faithfully each week so far and am thoroughly enjoying the show. It is probably my third favorite right now behind Lost and Heroes. The premise of the show is fascinating and thrilling. Very unique. I was excited from the moment I saw the first preview - and so far I haven't been let down. Is it realistic? No probably not. Is is predictable? Yeah, pretty much. But it's a TV show. What TV show is 100% realistic? Viewers are meant to let go of reality and absorb themselves in the fictional world for an hour once per week. It has great character development (who is good and who is bad?). It has mystery. Romance. Action. For those who watch and then hack it to death on the boards - I say stop worrying so much about whether things would really happen that way and enjoy the weekly ride. It's been fun for me so far...",2006
10,"""Jericho"" is by far, the best new show of 2006. I watched the pilot episode on CBS and I was extremely impressed with it. The acting, storyline, and the whole premise of the show is fantastic! I even got teary eyed a few times through the show. That is a rare thing for me. I usually never get teary eyed during a show or a movie. However, ""Jericho"" is a whole different kind of show. It was actually suspenseful and even a little bit scary! ",2006
10,"Having seen only two episodes, I am mildly surprised by the effectiveness of this well presented drama. A relationships-based drama, focused around the family of the Mayor (Gerald McRaney) of a small town, Jericho, thus far the acting and writing is top notch. Tense story lines have been the mark of Jericho thus far. Reminiscent of 24, Jericho is setting up well, and I look forward to the unwinding of the story of a few thousand people struggling to survive and overcome the aftermath of a multiple strike atomic holocaust coast to coast in America's metropolitan centers, leaving Jericho an island of life and hope. Of particular note is the acting of Allison Scott, the acting of Skeet Ulrich, and the understated but grounding performances of both McRaney and as his wife and the matriarch, the always fine Pamela Reed. It will be interesting to see if this strong start can be sustained, or if the storyline will wear thin. The executive production team is youthful but in combination has significant experience in film and in relationship-based TV that bodes well. In order for Jericho to survive, and it should, the tension needs to be maintained for the central family, for Jericho's attempts to survive, for the people of Jericho to maintain their humanity and their optimism, and for the outside world to impinge in a way that makes the struggle for the better parts of our human condition endure. Mighty big tasks, but my hope is that this intelligent, sensitive, and provocative program survives too.",2006
9,I really found this show refreshing. Its not the greatest show ever but it was entertaining. The show gives the feel of Saturday morning serials (fast paced and leaving you with a cliff-hanger). I loved the underlying messages to our current governmental situation. I just learned that it was not to be picked up again. I can't believe CBS is cancelling the show after the response they received after it was cancelled the first time. I hope that some other network (ie. SciFi) will try to carry on the series (sort of like Battlestar Galactica) to a complete and thorough conclusion even if it doesn't fit the usual format of a least five years.,2008
8,"It's not the first time I get interested in watching something about post-apocalyptic world. The fact is, I'm always in mood to see stuff about that theme. However, despite all that, I couldn't even imagine how amazing was going to be Jericho prior to begin watching it. It's simply fantastic! The show lets you brainstorm about how to survive and find solutions after your country is hit by nuclear bombs. The plot is really suspenseful and you end up asking yourself a lot of questions: Was that growing mushroom a terrorist attack? Who has planned that? Who is that mysterious man known as Mr. Hawkins? And what about the obscure Jake Green's past? ",2013
10,"Jericho is one of those shows that snags you by surprise...you aren't really sure why you started to watch it then before you know it your anxious about next week's show.. The 2nd episode was by far better than the first...I really want to know what exactly has Jake and the ""ex cop"" from St.Louis were doing prior to the mushroom cloud.. I hope CBS sees the potential in the cast and the story line and they do not drop the bomb on the show. Plus Skeet is a hottie..If someone you know has not watched the show tell them to tune in..Who care about old washed up stars dancing anyway?...Jericho is one of the best new TV shows this season. Thanks CBS ...now what is next?",2006
10,"This is the best new show I've seen in a long time and the casting is brilliant skeet ulrich would not of been my first choice for the role of Jake but the more I watch the more Skeet grows into the role and not to mention anything that could spoil the series but I cannot believe how well the idea/premise behind the show fits with modern day living the who was it how did it happen is intriguing but not only that you have to keep trying to guess who are the good guys who are the bad you'll never see a better piece of t.v with such intrigues as this one I would definitely recommend to people whom like anything lost fans for the intrigue, sci fir fans because of the plot (e.g roswell, buffy, etc), those fans of law and order or csi because of the mystery in the story, and finally those whom like the teary eyed melodramas because of the human angle.",2007
5,"The premise is certainly interesting enough. A small town seemingly cut off from the rest of the world as civilization itself might have gone up with a mushroom cloud. It's a story that has been effectively told in the book Alas Babylon and the miniseries The Day After. Those are big footsteps to follow in, and I'm not too sure this show can do it.",2006
10,"This has got to be by far the best series on TV. The mixture of mystery/drama/science fiction is excellent as well as the characters. It reminds me of William Johnston's book series ""The Ashes"" with the doomsday theme. Skeet Ulrich's character is suspenseful because no one knows where he's been or what he's done for the last 5 years, yet he's able to save a little girl on the bus and then kill one of the convicts his first day back! The way they ended the second show with the former policeman putting red pins on cities that were nuked and not showing where he put all the pins leaves you in suspense! Keep up the great job and don't cancel this show!!!!",2006
3,"Jericho has a good premise, ie, the experiences of a small town after a infrastructure crippling disaster striking the entire United States. Me, personally? I love the post-apocalyptic genre when it's done well. It lends itself easily to drama, with themes of trust, sacrifice, and leadership available immediately Let's get one thing out of the way first, however, and that is that the whole idea is NOT original. Why people think that is beyond me, as there are loads of post-apocalyptic fiction, movies, and TV shows out there, and even more specifically, ones that deal with this exact situation.",2007
4,"I was initially sucked in... I am also a huge fan of post-apocalyptic movies, shows, and books. That is, until they tried to treat radiation sickness with iodine off the shelf. I suppose the writers never even bothered to check that out on any web page readily available on the subject. Then comes the Rain fallout: once it stops raining, everyone just went back to their fields and harvested the highly contaminated food from the highly contaminated soil. Alrighty then.... They also lack any sort of military adviser given the way they handle every armed encounter. It wouldn't be so awful if the characters didn't consist of an ex-Army Ranger, a mercenary and black ops member, and an FBI ""uber"" agent. While the acting is acceptable, the characters in general, are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, with little depth or deviation from their assigned roles. The women in the story are simply window dressing for the men and have no real voice or power. The men run the show, make all decisions, while the women in true 1950's fashion, support their men- regardless of how many bad, ignorant decisions they keep making. They simply hold down the fort, cook up food for the menfolk, and nurse the sick, all with perfect hair and makeup. On several occasions, they stupidly squander resources - like when they have a giant town BBQ with the meat so it doesn't spoil instead of smoking or salt-curing it; or like lighting up the street lights with the limited electric power they have. There also does not seem to be one short wave radio operator in town that can get a signal from even the closest town. Lastly, the unrealistic feel of the town is impossible to ignore. No major chain grocery? No real department store? One doctor in a town of 5000 people? It is a ridiculous attempt by the writers to portray a perfect middle America Mayberry RFD town to appeal to the masses -- unfortunately, that kind of town hasn't existed in about 50 years - if it ever did. I would suspect none of the writers have even driven through the Midwest, if this is how they picture it. ",2007
3,"I'm fascinated by this show partly because I am a big fan of post-apocalyptic fiction (Alas Babylon, The Day After, Testament, The Last Ship, Threads, On the Beach, etc). I recommend ""Threads""(BBC 1984). After viewing it, you will wonder why someone hasn't done a good book or movie about Hurricane Katrina using it's premise. ",2006
1,"Great idea for a TV show and first and 2nd episodes were watchable, but after that it turned into the worst sci-fi soap opera. These people have NO imagination at all, the plot is just plain stupid; just think about this: it's been 2 months since the nuclear bombing and nobody knows what's outside their own town - Jericho, almost every scene is indoors and the characters don't do anything but to talk and then talk some more. Even when they run out of food they don't leave town - they simply find a wrecked food train just outside their city.... ",2006
4,"Gamma World written by Madison Avenue. Factually and scientifically inaccurate melodrama mawkishness. Why couldn't the writers pick up a copy of the Planet of the Apes Movies or the Gamma World Role Playing Game and go from there? I have always dined at the table of a longed for good nuclear apocalypse show and have always gone away from the table hungry. This show develops too slowly, and why are all the girls still so pretty with their hair done so nice with their make up and collagen lips and plastic hips after a nuclear holocaust? How come the former St. Louis cop hyper-competently instructs the yokels how to duct tape their houses but yet decides to keep his Morse code short-wave radio knowledge of the extent of the national destruction a secret for only the viewers to melodramatically know at the end of episode 2? Why can you survive by putting plastic on your windows during the radiation rain, but half the town has to be buried in an explosion in a salt mine deep beneath the earth? Why don't they just put dinosaurs in F-16's? Unlike Jericho's depicted apocalypse, I predict this show will die an early death with a whimper.",2006
1,"Having heard good reports about ""Jericho"" I delved in, hoping for a realistic and moving depiction of an American small town being isolated by surrounding nuclear attacks.",2007
5,"I wanted this to be a good show as the premise seems good for a television vehicle. And the main plot is good; the problems faced in the aftermath of some kind of nuclear explosions is a good plot line. However, the subplots of intrigue, conspiracy and apathy ruin this show for me.",2006
10,"After watching Lost, I saw the commercial for this on TV and I watched the commercial and I decided that I just had to see what this show was like, so, I went to iTunes and bought the pilot episode and after seeing the pilot I just needed to watch more. I then started to watch it every week when a new episode appeared on TV. I can't wait for the season to restart after the Winter Break and when it comes back on it will hopefully be even better and more people will want to watch it. This in my opinion was in the top 5 for TV shows of 2006 and will be the same in 2007. Everyone should give this show, and every other show out there, a chance before they give their opinion.",2007
9,"What a surprise Jericho was for me. I started watching on Netflix about a month ago and found this show to be well written, well acted and exciting. What would happen if the worst happen? How would the average American citizen survivor survive? What would happen if some rogue group took over? This are all good questions and this series did a good job of portraying the average American citizen. The tragedy and victories were well played and realistic. It's a shame the show didn't last, as I have said many, many times - how can shows like Buffy and Angel last 6 seasons when a well done show like Jericho barely lasts 1.5 seasons. What is wrong with the networks???",2012
2,"Gee how can I start by saying, what the hell was that? Back in 1959, Pat Frank wrote the classic post-apocalyptic novel, ""Alas, Babylon,"" which still remains iconic and unique in a genre that has spawned countless novels, films, and television shows. In the novel, we witness how a small, rural Florida community strives to survive in the wake of a global nuclear war. It's a fantastic read, particularly, because of the skillful use of character development: After the bombs fall, the rich banker finds out that his prestige and wealth are now just pieces of paper- the librarian who found herself marginalized in the dawning age of the television finds herself the guardian of the only source of knowledge and entertainment in town- the white and black communities, formerly separated by history and mutual prejudice, are brought together.",2008
5,"Disaster movies have resurged and now have led us to disaster TV. They always make for spectacular viewing. Most disaster flicks are now miniseries, like ""Asteroid"" and ""10.5"" which hang onto the unsubtly melodramatic ways of the original ""Poseidon Adventure"" ""Earthquake"" or ""Airport 77"" when everyone fixated on the disaster itself and teased their audiences with unspectacular special effects of scale models and rear-screen projection. Film (and TV) makers now focus more often on the drama rising from catastrophe. ""Lost"" is a sci-fi phenomenon spun around a truly disastrous plane crash and plays up character interaction while it tries to stretch its weirdness out across the seasons. It's effectively engineered TV. ""Jericho"" has a premise with similar promise, but it seems to lack the chops necessary to survive the fierce competition of the 2006 fall lineup.",2006
7,"So we are done with the first season of this interesting premise combining the classic movie ""The Day After"" with the equally strong British post-catastrophe show from the seventies called ""Survivors"". The British show had a virus kill of 99% of the British population, so the rebuilding and maintaining of society and civilization is the same as here. However this US show is so far spending way to much time in close-ups of soapy sub-plots that belongs on daytime television instead being the though gritty tale it could be. I don't mind the big baddie lurking far away as a potential threat, but the story ought to focus on the rebuilding of society if it is going tell a meaningful tale. As with the ""Invasion"" show from 2005 nothing much happens at all between the pilot and episode 12 at which point it has almost painted itself into a corner... We will see what (if anything) happens to save the show. Points for pretty decent acting (although they killed the best one in the final - that was nuts...), potential and some of the subplots, but thats it - more than seven is nuts...",2007
10,"Just finished watching Jericho on Netflix (all 29 episodes over two days). Others have written about the show's premise and storyline, so I won't repeat those here. As for my take on the show: First I have to say, anyone claiming that the acting is poor either stopped watching after a couple episodes or watched a different show entirely. Rarely have I seen such moving performances on television or anywhere else. I found myself relating to almost all the characters, and their hardships were believable and realistic. If anything, the acting was TOO moving; my wife and I were both teared up a few times, and given that several of the main characters die and there is no shortage of sad moments.",2012
2,Just came back from seeing this film and I really need to stress at how crap a film it was. I had read the reviews of it being better than saw 2 and more like saw 1 (which was good!) but they were talking rubbish. This film relies purely on gore and the ability to make you cringe. The plot was stupid and too far fetched which only idiots who enjoy this brain numbing turdness would accept. I didn't even know who the lead character was...there was none I'm sure. The narrative was poor and the acting was naff.,2006
7,"I would like to start by saying that I am a huge Saw fan, and came into this movie with more hype and enthusiasm than any other movie in my life. Possibly I set the bar too high, leaving it hard for this third installment to complete a legendary trilogy in the horror genre. First of all, I loved the scenario. Very similar to Saw II, Saw III had multiple ""games"" being carried on at once. Amanda kidnapping Dr. Lynn in order to keep Jigsaw alive, so that he could put Jeff through a series of vicious and gut wrenching events. Events that Jeff alone chooses the outcomes of.",2006
3,"In the first two Saw films there was something there that made the movie not just about the gore or the brutality that put it head and shoulders above all the other slasher films, there was intelligence and hope. The victims of Jigsaw were almost always given a modicum of hope that they could survive what they were given and come out breathing if they acted intelligently enough. Furthermore, the ending of each film was always brutal and yet hopeful at the same time. In the first Saw unanswered questions concerning Dr Gordon and Adam gave us hope. In the second Saw, the outcomes of the lives of Daniel, Detective Matthews, Amanda and Kerry may have been brutalized (emotionally or physically), but there was still hope.",2006
2,"Saw was a smash hit at the box office for a few reasons. First, James Wan is a fantastic visionary director. He manages to tell the story, build suspense, scare the crap out of the audience when necessary, but best of all (like any GOOD horror film), the viewer is strung out waiting for the next twist. The ending is so awesome, we finally get to see who Jigsaw really is, and it's the last person anyone expects (we even see John earlier in the film in a hospital bed, but NO ONE could ever have suspected...) The film wasn't even well-acted, but the STORY and the way the story unfurled was genius. Danny Glover and his search for Jigsaw, clue by clue, is what really sells everything home. By the end, we want to know who Jigsaw is worse then the men chained in the basement. When we find out the truth, it is so satisfying. That is a what a GOOD movie does.",2006
1,"A few things about this whole ""Saw"" series that I hate: 1. The repulsive attempt to support the belief that Jigsaw is not a murderer - in all these movies. Unfortunately some people believe in this nonsense, which is enough to convince me that in these days many people's minds are simply warped and rotten beyond understanding.",2007
3,"The plot is weak, the gore is weak, the characters are weak and nothing really has a purpose in the movie other than to make people with queasy stomachs want to throw up. As a horror fan, knowing what i know about the genre, this movie is just meant to shock people. The situations the people are put in are not clever, and they are elaborate and ridiculous. They ""explain"" why the murders seem to be pointless in the movie later, but it still doesn't make it any more entertaining. The most gruesome part is when one character performs surgery on Jigsaw. Horror fans, don't go see this movie unless you're in a bad mood and want to have something to complain about. For everyone else, it may provide some gross stuff to make you a little squirmy but thats about it. It hasn't got a clever twist at the end like the first two. The second movie was bad but at least it had a fun twist at the end.",2006
3,"This movie stunk. I loved the first two, but this one was terrible. It gave away some of the secrets from Saw 1 and 2. This one actually diminished the first two pictures. This movie is too predictable. There's a little twist at the end, but nothing like the surprises at the end of the first two. The whole plot deals with Amanda, but Jigsaw is the real star of the series. The fact that he is an ancillary character just ruins it for me. The final sequence is terrible and predictable. You should probably see it just for the sake of completeness, but it's easily the worst of the 3 movies, and is a shameful end to the trilogy.",2006
6,"""Saw III"" is a classic case of an ambitious sequel that has a few really nice ideas and some scenes that will make fans of the franchise very happy, but in the end it doesn't, it can't hold a candle to the original. It's a rule of the series by now that a ""Saw"" movie must include a lot of gory deaths as well as an unexpected twist at the end. While the first thing isn't so hard to come up with - and the makers definitely do a fine job thinking of the sickest, bloodiest deaths possible - it's the twist that seems more forced with each entry in the franchise. It's a disadvantage that we know for a fact a surprise is coming. What's worse is that in ""Saw III"" the final twist doesn't resolve a question we've been asking ourselves during the whole movie. No, it's question and answer in one and that doesn't make it particularly interesting. It's just a lot of explaining over some annoyingly edited flashbacks.",2007
7,"Surprise! There is a horror series that holds up well, even on the second sequel.",2006
3,"OK so here is my problem with Saw III. First off, we are supposed to see this Jigsaw guy as some kind of ""spiritual healer"" for people whose lives are in disarray. He takes people who have some sort of problem (note: the word problem is very loosely adapted in these films - according to jigsaw, a woman who is having marital problems needs to go through a deathtrap) and tries to help them ""heal"" themselves.",2007
3,"I don't expect this review to change anyone's mind about seeing the film - if you like the ""Saw"" franchise you're going to see this movie as well - no review will stop you. But, as one who has seen every installment, I found this incredibly disappointing.",2006
1,"I can give ""Saw"" credit for its originality and interesting twist, though it wasn't as well done as it easily could have been. Though ""Saw 2"" was extremely silly, I can understand releasing a sequel to a movie as popular as the original. ""Saw 3,"" however, was unnecessary and unforgivable.",2007

There were SO MANY flaws in this movie that were not only fatal, but also the minor ones kept adding up to create a general sense of disbelief about everything. This movie was a direct assault to viewers, almost like a slap in the face, as if to say: ""We know our movie doesn't make any sense, but could you open your mouth a little wider so we can cram this turd of a movie further down your throat?""",2006
9,"SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.",2009
9,"This movie, as always with the previous Saw installments, has once again proved to be worthwhile. The set-ups were great, the torture devices and scenes were unimaginable with NO limits whatsoever, and the ingenious traps Jigsaw puts on all of his victims were unbelievable. Saw 3 will keep you wondering what will be the outcome of the end. No doubt did this movie impress me and hopefully Saw fans as well. Now, as a warning, this movie did have some EXTREMELY sickening scenes with constant groans from audience in theater, but will nonetheless please its viewers. I highly recommend fans, and anyone who loves a good gross-out horror movie buff to see this latest Saw installment.",2006

9,"Well, i didn't walk into this theater expecting the greatest horror movie of all time, and i wasn't shocked. I was happy though with the experience and found myself shielding my eyes, trying to keep up with what is at first a very disjointed plot, and eventually trying not to see the predictable outcomes of this film. Loved the gore, loved the traps (although they were a bit much in this version, and unfortunately there weren't many actual traps, just some excess eye candy lying about the workshops and scenes of instruments of terror.) Honestly, i saw more gruesome items of destruction in the trailer for hostel 2, but whatever. The movie was well worth my eight bucks, and i will likely rent it when it comes out to watch it again. Loved the whole trilogy, and as for this movie. i think it can't stand alone. If you liked the first two, you'll love this one, just don;t expect too much. The plot was just right, once it got going, and the gore was intense, too much even for this hardcore horror lover, but hey- you get what you pay for.",2006

I can't really say I had any expectations, I mean, it's a third part in a series and such are rarely keeping the same quality as their predecessors.

10,"I was a Texas Western graduate in 1966 and attended the school all four previous years that Don Haskins (""the Bear"") coached the basketball team. Of course, Coach Haskins came to TWC in 1961 and built his team over 5 years, not in one year as the movie tells it. I went to every home game in 1965-66 and remember every one as if it were yesterday. I watched all of the away games that were televised, including all of the games the Miners played in the NCAA tournament. Even though the producers of ""Glory Road"" took considerable artistic license, the story is mostly true. Here are some facts. The Miners blew away fourth ranked Iowa during a holiday tournament that season. It wasn't even close as the movie depicts it. The great comeback was against New Mexico in the ""Pit"". When Hispanic guard David Palacio came in to play in the second half, the team seemed to settle down and came from a 20 point deficit to win in overtime. The incredibly close game, and probably best game in America that year between the true best college teams in America was the Regional final between third ranked TWC and fourth ranked Kansas (not #1 Kentucky and #2 Duke in the final four semifinal), when Jo Jo White made that last second basket in overtime with his foot on the base line. The Miners went on to beat Kansas 81-80 in double overtime. Then the Miners beat Utah in the first game of the final four. If white player Jerry Armstrong hadn't defended against Utah's great Jerry Chambers, a black player, the Miners probably wouldn't have made it to the championship game against Kentucky. Chambers was beating every defender badly, including Lattin, Shed, and Flournoy, until Armstrong was put in to cover him. Chambers finished with 38 points, mostly in the first half and was the tournament's MVP.",2006

7,Glory Road is a very entertaining movie if you are will to overlook its many inaccuracies. The movie would make the viewer think that Coach Haskins came to TWC and recruited a national championship caliber team in his first year as a collegiate coach. The truth is that Coach Haskins had been at TWC for 3 or 4 years before the national championship year and that there were several black players already at TWC including Nolan Richardson. Haskins also recruited Jim Barnes before the championship year and teams that Barnes played on may have been better than the championship team.,2006

I was a college basketball player then and remember the season well and pulled hard for Texas Western to beat UK. I took my wife to see this movie and told her I wasn't aware that the scenes depicted ever happened, but I would have been just as embarrassed then as I was when we left the theater.

It's the first movie that I've attended in a long time where at the end of the movie most of the audience broke out into spontaneous applause (a mostly white bread group, too). Stay around for the credits. While they run, you'll see pictures, footage, and interviews of the REAL people involved. Historically, pretty right on. I don't usually suggest that high school history classes ""movie-fy"" their history, but this gives a feeling of the racial ""climate"" (attitudes, some of what it felt like to live the situation -- fear, anger, pride, team support, friendship, etc) in a movie that doesn't feel as preachy as most of this genre and that younger people will find interesting and entertaining (so they'll pay attention). This happened in the 60's: PRE- Remember the Titans and at the college level instead of high school. It has many excellent performances. Yes, it makes use of some of the usual clich√©s in sports movies, but what's important in the movie is the story about people and events that changed the sports world (and our country) for the better.

Some say it's similar to the BBC show ""Footballers Wives"", but that show is a moody drama, while this show is a comedy that focuses on the relationships between the women and their men. The show is pretty accurate in the way they portray the women (especially the hierarchy: groupies are at the bottom of the pyramid, the girlfriends are next, the wives close to the top, and the footballers' mothers at the very top) and the players (especially how the veterans refer to the newbies as simply ""Rookie"".)

The show is really good and the acting is refreshing.

Jason's wife and leader of the sunbeams Kelly Pitts. The Game gives us a look inside the world of professional football players. One thing I like about the show is, the characters are not perfect they are just like you and me they make mistakes. The actors and actresses portray their characters with realism that is rarely seen in most sitcoms. Some posters have claimed about the writing, but for me, the writing is some of the best writing on television today for me, the acting on The Game should be required viewing in acting classes. I will admit, sometimes the story lines could be a little on the daytime soap opera side. If it wasn't we probably wouldn't watch it.",2011
10,"This is one of the few black TV shows that was on and I could laugh my butt off, relate too and enjoy. The storyline is so good that I got hooked along with plenty of others and we want more. I feel that there is so much that still needs to be shown with this show...and 3 seasons is hardly enough. I hope Bet really get's The Game back on for the 4th season and many more to come! Luv this show! (I hate when we get a new show and it gets canceled right when we start getting into it. Let's just also make sure it comes on at a good time too. That's part of the reason The CW dropped the show hell it kept moving the day it aired. It started on a Mon., then moved to a Thurs. then to a Fri. No wonder the ratings kept going down...who's at home on a Friday night?)",2009
2,"Admittedly I only watched part of this series online. I saw Momoa had appeared in the series and I enjoy his work so I found his episodes and watched only them. The stories and performances were stiff and uninspired and fell flat. Writing unimpressive. Talent was wasted. How a show can stifle the natural magnetism, goofiness and accessible, at times tangible vulnerability of Momoa I will never understand. Baywatch (not exactly known for it's deep content) did a better job of using his talents! Disappointing.",2017
6,"I saw this movie, I thought that he was a living thing which deceives people. Nobody expected that fraud began from the present got from his younger brother. And I cannot believed his older brother was became the victim of fraud. I thought that it became impossible for nobody to believe if many such things have happened. And I thought I should not do many things for sensational. Nicolas telephoned for sensational and ""the game"" started. The face of the pierrot who was rolling in the house was most impressive. The pierrot seemed very uncanny. From the second half of a movie, it was thrilling. I gave feeling of being at a performance that the scene of shooting and the scenes sunking into the sea in a taxi. His counterattack was very smart after it turns out that Nicolas understood that CRS is a fraud organization at last. I thought that justice won any time.",2013
1,"The game is probably the most boring comedy/drama I have ever seen. Don't waste your time with this. The jokes are either dull or childish and I don't see why they keep on playing the laughter tracks/soundboard even when something's clearly not funny. Matter of fact, without the laughter recordings, you'd probably never tell that it's comedy; and it really doesn't fit the description of a drama either. It used to be good some years back when I first watched it(although I only saw two or three episodes), but now it's just poor work from the writers , directors etc. It's at the point where 'How I met Your Mother' is heading. Boring as hell Some of the actors are good as I have seen them in other shows but this show is just a waste of time.",2012
9,"It's a real shame that everything I had read about D√©j√† Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, D√©j√† Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.",2006
8,"I'd say this movie definitely lived up to expectations I had from the ad trailers. A good mix of science fiction and cop drama, with the occasional good joke. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Denzel entertained as usual, as did Adam Goldberg. Don't be turned off by the professional reviewers. Those guys can never seem to enjoy a movie that's content with being slightly unbelievable. If I always wanted believable, I'd stick to documentaries or the news. There won't be any Oscars coming out of it, but it was a action-filled thriller that kept me guessing till the end. If you liked the Island, this is right up your ally.",2006
8,"I usually like sci-fi when it's pure sci-fi. I usually like present day drama when it's believably real. Disaster, at least for me, looms large when sci-fi meets real life drama. So here we have a present day crime thriller crossed with sci-fi time travel...And, this movie kicks butt, works so well, in fact, it's nuances should be studied in film school. It's original enough to be compelling-where we are not in some distant future, but the here and now.",2007
9,"I was also at that Century City screening last night, and I was probably one of the people who were saying they thought this movie was awesome. I enjoyed it immensely. It has been described as an action-adventure-romance-sci-fi pic and it truly is all of that.",2006
9,"I'll start by saying that I was reluctant to even see this movie but after some insistence by family, I sat and watched in pure enjoyment.",2006
10,"It has been quite a while since I have seen a film that was this beautifully crafted and nearly flawless. The acting is very convincing and the storyline follows quite closely to a Michael Criton-esquire novel. I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far, and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by this film. For one thing, it stars Denzel Washington, Jim Cavizel, who I felt did a marvelous job at playing the antagonist, Val Kilmer, and Bruce Greenwood. With these four actors, you typically cannot go wrong. I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today. They have raw talent, are not just getting by on their looks, and their performance, especially in this film, shows it. ""Deja Vu"" is one of those rare films that grabs a hold of you from the very start and does not let go of you until the very end. People even clapped after the film ended and such applause was well deserved. If you do anything at all this Thanksgiving weekend, then by all means, put going to see ""Deja Vu"" on your shopping list. I can promise you that both you and your family/significant others will be blow though the very back wall of the theater.",2006
1,"I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now, for the most part, a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood stooped so low as to hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on internet sites like this one! ",2007
3,"This movie was embarrassing to watch. The thing that annoyed me the most was the fantastic time machine. Right, a video in HD-quality with sound that can be fixed in every possible angle and even zoom in so you can watch the digits on a phone display. Inside a house! And if you put something that stupid in a movie; don't try to explain it using real physics. It just makes matters worse; especially if you know physics. And this video system from the past was something a couple of guys had put together in a couple of days. Not to mention that these guys were the typical ubersmart morons you see in every sci-fi B-movie.",2007

1,"I am really sorry if I offend some of the commentators' tastes, but for me this movie was a complete disaster.",2006
2,"I consider time-travelling movies particularly interesting most of the time. I like the idea of a bridge between past and present, that turns communication possible, as well as timeline branching. I can remember ""Frequency"", that i found an amazing movie and recommend to those enjoying this subject. About this movie, there are a few things i particularly dislike. It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted. Why was that paper sent to a place where Denzel would be just in that instant? After that ""forced failure"", why didn't they try to send the paper once again to a place he could certainly see it... his home for example... didn't he ever go to sleep? Then to solve all the problems... it was made possible sending him to the past... well i can't comment on that, i'll just assume it as a possibility in movie's reality, though it would be kind of impossible to imagine it after so much trouble sending the mass of little sheet of paper. But even when he was sent to the past, after the girl's rescue, the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything. Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and ""Claire"" (Paula Patton) had been set. And of course even more important was to make him appear once again, so that all people get happy again... I can't like movies that get their suspense or any other type of emotions, by turning characters dumb, this is usually done in bad horror movies. These and many other reasons don't make this movie a good reason to go to cinema. This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played, so that we don't take the movie too seriously.",2007
9,"This was a terrific movie, plain and simple. It kept you thinking and guessing at what was really going on, and in the end, all the holes close. That is unusual for any kind of ""playing with time"" kind of film, and all those involved deserve credit for doing it right. While the whole premise of the science involved has a deep flaw in it, it's not the sort of flaw that precludes the suspension of disbelief. Denzel Washington, Jim Caviziel and Adam Goldberg give memorable performances. Of course, there is no one better than Tony Scott when it comes to telling a story with pictures, and he's as good here, if not better than in Enemy of the State.",2006
7,"This crime-time travel movie was interesting all the way, but I can't help thinking it could have been much better. There were just too many holes in this story, too many clich√©s and implausible things that made it less enjoyable than it could have been. ",2007
3,"Though moderately entertaining, there are too many things you have to overlook to make it one cohesive movie. So let's begin. ",2006
9,"After seeing ""Man on Fire"" I was looking forward to a movie from Tony Scott and Denzel. The movie was worth waiting for. I have seen this movie at a theater with no empty seats. The story is great, the acting is pretty good. There were a few moments where the story was broken but was not a big issue within the whole story. The story is about a terrorist blowing a ship where there was a celebration of the Navy. Denzel investigates the crime and finds some clues that don't make sense. He is invited to work with a special investigation unit because he is a local (and a smart detective). There are pretty original action scenes that were shot clearly (unlike ""Domino"" where the camera was shaky and fuzzy all the time). If you like an action movie with some good story, this is the movie for you. TRIVIA: The word ""Dejavu"" is not mentioned even once, in the movie.",2006
6,"This movie was pretty much what I expected. Nothing too serious, just a fun ride from the beginning till the end. The plot has this good twist in it, which makes the movie interesting and there is overall pretty much the right amount of sci-fi and thriller blended together.",2007
8,"OK, am i wrong, or is the comments area in IMDb there for commenting a movie? What can i say? Some of the people in here are not commenting the movie, they adapt it to our own reality and try to make sense out of it. I will not make the same mistake....",2007
8,"Deja Vu is a high-action, crime-drama, sci-fi, thriller which is exactly what you would expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of such action-adventures as ""Con Air,"" ""Enemy of the State,"" ""National Treasure,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and another Denzel Washington favorite, ""Remember the Titans."" ",2006
1,"*SPOILERS* I went to see this movie because of Denzel Washington. I walked out at about halftime, I couldn't take it.",2006
1,"I seriously get tired (bored) of some stories, because the stories of such movies are always the same, nothing new or different and some of them is lack of entertainment or action or both which is unbearable. We go to the cinema or buy DVDs to see action movies or thrillers and to be entertained, but... Deja Vu is the most tasteless action thriller ever made to me which is surprising because the director is Tony Scott who I enjoyed almost all of his films that I have seen so far. The movie looks good, but not stylish. The movie was not fun at all to me, because many parts of the movie take place in a research center, scientific institution where Carlin spends most of his time to illustrate the case. I very seldomly call a movie boring, but these scenes are boring, there is only one, yes one action scene in the movie which we can see almost nothing, because Carlin sees the present and the past at the same time in this action scene. This scene is also pretty short. I don't know how can I explain this, but the movie was crude a sort of. The action thrillers about time travel are usually very bad, even if it is not as bad as Deja Vu, Next was very bad, but at least pretty enjoyable. The plot of the movie is based on a psychopath who detonates a bomb in a cruise ship and a cop who tries to stop him. What a clich√© and banal story, oh dear, extremely dated. Didn't they realize that the story itself is a real deja vu? Why they don't give up writing same stories about a man who detonates somewhere and people who race against time? The Dark Knight was the same either, wasn't it? Almost all the people who watched the film say it is a fun ride. Is it?",2009
2,Really? Really? There are people out there that actually liked this movie? ,2008
1,"I have recently been watching a string of movies dealing with time travel/parallel universes, such as Primer, La Moustache, The Machinist. Deja Vu seemed to fit the category, so I decided to give it a try. While most of the other movies were a bit obscure, this one had a sizable budget and did well in the box office. A 7.1 looks good, so I was expecting something meaningful. Boy did I get burned. This movie is atrocious.",2009
6,"There is a new genre infesting our nation's movie theaters. With apologies to Garrison Kellior, let's call it ""guy noir"". Films aimed directly at the young, hip male audience. Movies that are an unholy combination of old fashioned film noir and the modern action movie, as directed by the class clown. They offer fast paced entertainment, great character actors, twisty plot lines, explosions and more spent ordinance than used in a typical week in Baghdad. Even new genres breed clich√©s however and the original freshness heralded by Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is beginning to smell the slightest bit stale. This brings us to Smokin' Aces, a movie that isn't so smug as to be intolerable or so brilliant as to be ground breaking. Rather it is good, competent, workmanlike example of its genre, which is bad news for a movie that wants to be hip and edgy.",2007
7,"Here's another addition to anyone's list of definitive ""guy flicks"". Compared to testosterone treats like Jason Statham's pair of Transporter stints, this one offers a more complicated plot, fewer explosions and chases, but more gruesome killings. Plus some fine touches of grim humor, and a dash of eye candy. It comes from the fertile, if demented, mind of Joe Carnahan, who struck first with the cheapie hit Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane, before upgrading to studio-quality crime drama in Narc. Arguably, he's the US doppelganger for England's Guy Ritchie (Lox, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch - both also featuring Statham), since he's less arty and cinematically historical about showcasing mayhem than Quentin Tarantino.",2007
7,"Smoking Aces is a film that tries hard, and in doing so is one that is not going to be easy to describe. The basic plot revolves around the central character ""Aces"" who is testifying against the mob, and in return has a contract out on his head. Locked away in his suite in Las Vegas, he is protected by the Fed, but there are multiple contract killers (all different from each as can be imagined!) out to get him.",2007
3,"This movie should get high marks for its style, but everything about its style that is likable, was ripped off from Guy Ritchie. The plot is sooo out there, that I can only imagine that the writer, director... producers and pretty much every studio exec was doing more blow than the characters in the film. ",2007

1,"Ray Ray Ray....did 'Revolver' teach you nothing?? For a man who was once in a Scorsese movie, its hard to imagine he'd end up like this....sunk to depths of the lowest degree. Well hopefully the reviews this film will no doubt receive will teach Mr. Liotta a thing or two about 'money over credibility', because this film is enough to suffocate anyone's career.

3,"I should have known when I saw a badly edited trailer that I thought was calling for ""Israel's Death"" ... that this was going to be bad. However, an offer of a free preview was too tempting.

In 2013 we now recognize that this was the first (and very likely the best) in an entirely new category of film, call it, for lack of a better term, ""extreme crime/action."" (I have on IMDb reviewed another of my faves in this category, SHOOT EM UP). Prior to doing this retrospective review I re-watched SMOKIN' ACES, beginning to end. My notes: 1. Great script -- a crazy concept well addressed, with a script that even now is several notches above the stuff that JJ Abrams is currently peddling. Logic says that a movie about a bunch of idiosyncratic assassins converging on a single target should not work, should not make sense, but this story strikes just the right balance between sensible and nuts; 2. Cast? In this genre, probably the largest assortment of stars ever assembled. Credit for not merely trying something new, but front-loading it with talent to spare. 3. Direction? As good or better than any martial arts film, in other words, a very high standard, every bullet seems to go somewhere. 4. Ending? Clever, attention-getting and satisfying. Overall score 10, both for being an excellent production and for creating a new category of film",2013
7,"There was a fair amount of comedy, thrill, and action. Each element was delivered at the right moment. The premise of the movie is not too complex. The movie provides enough background information in order for you to enjoy the movie. You have to buy in to the contrivance that multiple people are going to try to kill one man on the top floor of a casino. If you get pass that, you will have a really good time. Character performances were great. It has an amazing cast. Wonderful performances are given to Ryan Reynolds in a serious role and Jeremey Piven.",2007

I went to the screening and I'm glad that i waited the 45min outside in the 25 degree weather and then another hour inside the movie theater with a bunch of loud people next to me. Trust me...its worth your money and your time. One word of advice though. This movie is not for people with attention problems. You miss one second of this movie or even a word you might miss the whole object of the movie so just be careful. Jeremy Piven (Buddy 'Aces' Israel) was dramatic as well as freaking hilarious. Ryan Reynolds (Agent Richard Messner) was also a strong dual character. His comedic presence as well as his strong dramatic performance was enough to make this movie a hit in theaters. The rest of the cast are well known actors who each play there own essential role in the movie and make it that much better. I hope you like the movie and my review.

10,I went to the world premier of this movie and it was excellent. I was surprised at how they made a hit man movie with a great story so stylish. The action sequences were very entertaining along with Jeremy Piven smart style and elegant acting making this movie superb. It keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. It is a very hard hitting mob movie. With some unfamiliarly faces to the hit men. Then there is Ben Affleck who plays Jack Dupree in perfect fashion. I came to see a good crime movie and thats what they gave me. There is no way you cannot like this movie unless your under seven. It has everything suspense action violence sexiness and even comedy.,2007
1,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing. Two words can explain why: train wreck. What was the director thinking, over exposing the entire film, was harsh to watch. The over exposure had me turned off from the start. Then the 20 minutes of story telling with titles explaining each character as if I'm 3 years old (I can't wait until SNL parodies this). The ironic tie ins for each character was elementary. The only reason I even watched this movie is because of the cast, I bet their agents got an earful after they saw the film. Had to be the worst story line and worst plot ever to make it to film. And the ending, what the F*** was that. I mean I watched this whole film so Andy Garcia could spew some ridiculous list of tie ins out of his mouth that was supposed to make me go "" oh my God, this is the best story ever"". It felt more like being chained naked to 9 wild horses and being dragged across asphalt for 2 hours. Please don't even waste your time with this film. The worst part is the recommended films at the bottom of this page. How could anyone that likes this movie even think compare this to the ""Godfater"", Goodfellas"", etc.",2007
2,"It's said that if you want to make a great film then keep the premise simple and SMOKIN' ACES has a relatively simple premise of the mob putting a million dollar contract on potential star witness Buddy "" Aces "" Israel and rival gangs of hit men trying to eliminate both Aces and each other to get their hands on the money . I'm sure we all agree that this is a fairly simple and effective idea for a film . Alas what can often happen is that a writer or a producer can throw a massive spanner in the works by making everything too over complicated ",2007

If the prior user had paid a little more attention to this film he would have noticed how intricate and brilliant the plot was.

I would agree that you spend the first 20 minutes in confusion because of its fast paced plot, but by the end, your sympathies for individual characters are all over the place.

8,"Bruce Willis, Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci and Josh Hartnett fill a cast line up every bit as impressive as say, Sin City. Leaving behind the sour taste of Wicker Park, Scottish McGuigan follows the likes of his own Gangster Number 1 with this incredibly cool, at times funny thriller that has somehow sneaked into the cinemas without much of a fuss. Supporting cast includes a very welcome cameo from a Jackie Brown star and a bunch of UK actors imitating their US counterpart's accents to perfection. The pairing of Sir Ben and Freeman alone is worth the price of admission, but this is Hartnett(as Slevin)'s film and perhaps it should not be too surprising that he carries it off effectively. In fact, none of the cast really put a foot wrong and even Lucy Liu is pretty adorable (against type if you believe the all the press).",2006

People are getting killed left and right, and it's never clear until the end of the movie how they are all connected. But you know it fits somehow and Scottish director Paul McGuigan (Wicker Park) manages to keep you guessing while firmly grabbing your attention and holding it with hardly a second to take a breath.",2006
7,"Lucky Number Slevin is an impressive action crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Paul McGuigan is admirable in making this movie about a guy named Slevin who after a case of mistake identity finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two rival crime bosses known as The Rabbi and The Boss. Josh Hartnett is good as Slevin who may know more about his situation than he's letting on or maybe not. Hartnett proves to be effective in the role. Morgan Freeman is great as The Boss but he isn't given much to do. The same can go for Ben Kinsgley as The Rabbi but he like Freeman still make the best of their villain roles. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis as a hit-man are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The few action sequences are well executed and the intricate but not too complicated plot keeps your interest. Despite some flaws with character development, this movie was better than expected. Overall Lucky Number Sleven is a good action crime thriller with an interesting premise and exceptional performances by the cast who making it a movie worth the time to watch.",2009

Keeping company with legends such as Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis (who has been taking more and more great roles recently), Josh Hartnett takes the lead in the title role and plays it well. Freeman and Kingsley are as ever faultless and brilliant. Willis is fantastic in this kind of role. The dark, understated, non-action-blockbuster, big cast thrillers suit him well. Keep it up Bruce. To top off this top-notcher, Lucy Lui is looking gorgeous in her role as the love interest. I look forward to watching more films by Paul McGuigan, a director I'd previously been unaware of. Rent it as soon as you can.",2006

9,"Our story began in the mind of writer Jason Smilovic and later directed well in the movie called "" Lucky Number Slevin "" by Paul McGuigan. It relates the story apparently initiated through mistaken identity. A traveler visiting a friend accepts an invitation to stay at an apartment in another city. Once there however, he meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu) a sexy next door neighbor, is slugged and mugged in broad daylight just before he is kidnapped and threatened with death if he doesn't pay a great debt and do a favor for The 'Boss', a local Godfather (Morgan Freeman). However, he also realizes, in order to fulfill the command, he must kill a total stranger for 'The Rabbi' a rival Godfather (Ben Kingsley). The reason for the duel threat dates back some twenty years and involves a professional Hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). The film is briefly confusing and further muddled if the audience doesn't pay close attention to the interesting players. Although a serious feature, the inclusion of dark comedy makes for a black situation which is flavored with fast action and hard hitting excitement. Josh Hartnett, plays Slevin Kelevra and holds his own against the heavyweight stars of the movie. All in all, an unexpected and wonderful movie recommended for the thinking audience. The result, . . . a Classic in the making. ****",2012
9,"If you like movies that make you think you will enjoy this film. Josh Hartnett stars as ""Slevin"" a guy who is down on his luck and gets mistaken for someone else, or does he...from the moment that the mob bosses get a hold of Slevin the movie turns into one big guessing game. If you are like me you will find yourself thinking and trying to figure out what exactly is going on, but you probably will never understand until all is explained in the brilliant climax ending of the film. I honestly can say that when you walk out of the theater you can say to whomever it is that you went to see this movie with that it was truly a great movie. Now I was lucky enough to have seen this at a screening back in December, and the entire theater started to applaud at the conclusion of the film. If you like mysteries definitely check this one out...and just by the slim chance that the reviews are mixed or not that great I will at least tell you from an avid movie lover to give this a chance and you will not regret it",2006
8,"""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a stylish revenge thriller with an incredible number of twists, a high body count and a collection of characters who are almost all totally amoral. Its strongest feature is its script which is sharp, witty and extremely funny with lots of quick-fire dialogue that perfectly complements the fast-moving pace of this highly entertaining movie. The Hitchcock and Tarantino influences are very apparent throughout and the combination of a mistaken identity story with colourful anecdotes and amusing banter provides plenty of humour, suspense and intrigue.",2014
5,"Lucky Number Slevin is the latest in a long line of movies that try to outdo everything else out there in the cleverness department and as a result, seems overdone. Ever since The Usual Suspects, it seems that more and more movies have become too desperate to trick or mislead the audience, and it seems that the people making these movies usually fail to realize what made the movies they're trying to emulate effective in the first place. The Usual Suspects was effective in misleading the audience because the plot is free of holes, and there is one well thought out twist that is believable and makes for a great ending. What happens in Lucky Number Slevin is that the twists are too plentiful, and the ones that aren't predictable are often trivial; they end up having very little impact and aren't satisfying. ",2006

5,"""Lucky Number Slevin"" feels like the thesis of a promising film student from the P T Anderson/ Quentin Tarantino school of smart ass film-making. To tell you the truth, I'm getting a bit too tired of this clever, oh so clever style of narration. The dialog, coming out of Freeman and Kingsley mouth is as fun as it is meaningless. Absurd without being Ionesco absurd. Absurd but self consciously so. After a little while you're way ahead of the characters - not plot wise naturally, but style wise. You know is going to be one of those movies trying to be those other movies. That in itself makes the experience rather frustrating. Thank God for Josh Harnett. He is an actor that manages to remind you of all those greats icons of the past and at the same time he's an original. The fact that I could actually see this movie again just to look at him, makes me think he'll be a huge star. The kind of star the people remember and loves, generation after generation. I wish he manages to find his Elia Kazan.",2006

The only thing that may surprise you is the partnership between Mr. Goodkat and Slevin which can also predicted. The scriptwriters should have noticed the ordinariness of the plot and decided to sweeten it with clever-riddled like dialogs.I admit that at the beginning I enjoyed the way the dialogs progress but after I while I find myself saying enough already.",2006
3,"Slevin sets a new landmark in tasteless film-making, being a foolish mix of tones and genres which actually leads nowhere. Within the frame of a tragic bloody revenge, the movies gives us a pointless love story, ultraviolent pulpfiction-like gangsters, corrupted cops, an ironic international killer who is eventually discovered to be happy at playing the father figure. The story starts as a tragedy, the climax scene (which is not the real end, of course: plenty of endings in this movie) ends it as a tragedy. In the middle we have all the above and maybe more, without a choice of style and taste. I rated it 3, but it is hard to rate a movie which is completely wrong.",2006

1,"John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" a groan-inducing title for a groan-inducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good half-decade of hibernation, yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suck-pump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the now-drained Tarantino Lake; Jason Smilovic penned this too-familiar tale of criminals with oh-so-enigmatic names (The Boss, The Rabbi, Slevin) speaking in a torrent of pop-culture clich√©s (James Bond, Norman Rockwell, Andy Griffith, and Alfred Hitchcock get shout-outs), involved in some oh-so-wacky, oh-so-ironic, oh-so-postmodern shenanigans, and director Paul McGuigan put the frantically-edited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis (whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter) and another character during the opening scene, it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and ""Slevin"" just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously self-aware ciphers, and following the plot is pointless, since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on (via dialog and flashbacks where--yup--information that was withheld is now revealed!), because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case, ""Slevin""'s unusually excellent cast would (at least somewhat) redeem the film, but veterans like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat, unmemorable script; meanwhile, Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness, but precious little sympathy. Actually, the one smidgen of talent on display in ""Slevin"" might be McGuigan's ability to squander a cast most directors would kill for--now THAT is a true achievement. For those who have never seen a good crime thriller and would like to look 'hip' and 'with it,' have a ball with ""Lucky Number Slevin""; the rest of us will be re-watching ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction.""",2006
2,"I must say that I am doubly deceived by this movie: first, by the movie itself, with a plot that could be good but in the end gets too uselessly complicated and ""Tarantinian"" to satisfy, and secondly because of the very high rating this movie has received by the voters of the IMDb. In fact, I think that the ""moral"" level (please don't misunderstand me, I'm not a moralist, but I think that a movie should be a bit careful in presenting as a positive character a man who is such a complete monster as the main character of this one) is alarming, to say the least. And what is worse this movie presents the most brutal vengeance as a perfectly justified and empathic reaction (weren't we supposed, after Eschylus, to think that the strong man is the one who resists the temptation to repay an eye for an eye?). So I could hardly believe my eyes when I watched the happy ending, where the guy gets the girl and lives happily ever after, in the most traditional and soppy happy ending one could imagine, as if he were an ordinary movie hero and not a (very improbable, by the way) cold-blooded and almost superman-like killer. In fact, he not only finishes off the two men against whom he has to avenge his father, but also (and this is the thing that has disturbed me most) the son of one of these two killers, a perfectly innocent guy who hasn't done anything except being gay! and making him a gay character, I sadly suspect, was a genial solution on the part of the writers not to make the public too sorry for him... yes, b-series human beings may well be killed without too many compliments, who cares after all? the important thing is that the gloriously heterosexual hero may get the girl, and live happily ever after? I have to admit that I am a bit disgusted.",2006

7,"Lucky Number Slevin ¬ñ no, that's not a typo ¬ñ will easily be dismissed as Tarantino-esquire. Starring Josh Hartnett as the unlucky title character, the film has more twists and turns than a high-tech roller-coaster, but it's just as much fun (and almost as immediately forgettable).",2006
2,"This one gets a second star only because of showing Josh Hartnett in a very low-rise towel for the first third of the film... great eye candy, not great acting. The script is so full of holes and cartoony stereotypes that one is tempted to think of it as some sort of fable or allegory - but it has no message at all. Armed criminals are displaying a hot young man with a beaten-up face in only a towel on crowded Manhattan streets and nobody notices? A major crime boss with megabucks has former Mossad agents guarding his son in a specially-secured room and they have no closed-circuit monitors and must protect him by blindly busting through a plaster wall? Both crime bosses have sentinels posted on the terraces outside their windows that just happen to vanish when they are assaulted by a strange young man that they don't really trust? Most disturbing is the awfully bigoted stereotyping... the African Americans who are all in crime, especially the two Amos and Andy style thugs who first kidnap the lead.... the Jews, who only use their religion as a front for evil, with Stars of David everywhere, almost like villains in a comic book... and of course, the crooked Italian cop. Just to avoid being called on their prejudices, the producers gratuitously throw in an Asian woman (who is culturally very assimilated, except when she eats noodles in one scene). All very cynical and very Hollywood. What is the moral of this film? Nothing - the good white gentile killers blow away all the evil ethnic killers. Great, guys.... another uplifting addition to Western culture. The only good news about this film is that apparently it didn't do well at the US box office... hope the same happens here in Europe.",2006
8,"Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.",2006
8,"Let me say up front, I had low expectations going into the film. Although I like animation a lot, I wasn't too impressed with previous Dreamworks attempts. I tend to regard cutesy previews with suspicion, and was mostly just going along to have a potentially positive movie-going experience with my family. Things got a little worse when we arrived at the theatre, and both the ticket-tearing guy (if cinemas have a technical name for that role, I don't know what it is) and some poor sap from the commissary tried to pressure-sell the ""fresh"" soda and popcorn. We had to go out of our way to avoid an extra ad-hoc kiosk the food vendors established smack in the middle of the lobby. I hope that doesn't become standard practice. The twenty-odd minutes of previews were similarly underwhelming, and I was starting to get a little nervous -- is it going to be one of those days I'll want to forget? Then, at long last, Over the Hedge starts. Now I'm not an avid follower of the comic, partly because I don't get to read newspapers very often. The Over the Hedge strip is kind of a latecoming competitor to affections reserved for the beloved Bloom County of my childhood, so I'm not exactly salivating at the potential content. However, I gotta say, I was blown away from the start.",2006
7,"While this movie doesn't have the depth of Finding Nemo or Shrek, it was a very fun and well done animation by Dreamworks. The animation was first rate, and the animals were very fun to watch. The voice acting was superb and well cast. What I enjoyed the most about this movie (other than the super funny bits here and there) is the social commentary they presented. It's nothing serious, but it shows us how gluttonous many of us ""humans"" have become. While many of the human characters are exaggerations, there's quite a bit of truth behind each caricature. My favorite is the Home Owner Association President. She was so overdone (yet so realistic!) that I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was so true to life, or if it was just so out there.",2006
8,"Wow! Wow! Wow! I was transfixed! The animation? Gorgeous! The subtle humor? Uproarious! The not-so-subtle humor? Even better! This was a great movie that will surely be nominated for an Oscar if for no other reason than the beauty of the animation. While I could have honestly thought of a couple of better casting choices, I will mention that Wanda Sykes, Thomas Haden Church and Steve Carrell were brilliant in their roles. And who better to make fun of William Shatner than William Shatner? Worthy of special mention (and a second look - go see this movie again!): the Rottweiler interludes, the ripples in the water, the porcupine quills, the oh-so-amazing foliage throughout the movie, and Vincent's cartoonish-yet-strangely-scary expression.",2006

9,"This movie was better than I expected. I thought that it would be predictable and one of the dime a dozen animation films coming out now. I am an animation fan, and the animation was great, in addition to the story. The characters were somewhat predictable, but very well done and not boring. The voices are very well done as well. This is a movie that children can also enjoy (sounds kind of odd being that animation films are usually supposed to be for kids), in addition to adults. It has some really funny parts that are not clich√© humor. Probably the best part about it is the message it sends about humans encroaching on animal habitats and how it affects the balance of nature.",2006
9,"I was able to see an advance showing of this movie with a mostly college-age audience and everyone was laughing throughout the movie. It was excellent. As my friend to the left said, sometimes the movie was over the top as well as over the hedge, but those times were some of the most hilarious. Action sequences early in the movie that had people roaring with laughter were topped by ones later on and small tidbits of comedy were spread throughout. Add to that the typical messages about family, friends, and doing-right and you have the formula for a great family comedy. The voice acting was solid; a really fine ensemble cast. I don't buy many animated movies, but I may have to pick this one up. Wheee!",2006
7,"The computer animated film has become to film studios what Mike Tyson was in the ring in the 1980's: a sure thing. You knew that when Tyson walked in the ring, somebody else was going down, and probably rather quickly. The same is true of most computer animated comedies these days: it is near sure to be a mix of material targeted at children and adults, feature lots of star voices and be entertaining, for the most part at least. Over the Hedge, the latest offering from Dreamworks, does not disappoint on any of the above fronts, and proves to be one more notch in computer animations belt.",2006

Over the Hedge thus sees RJ the raccoon (Bruce Willis) scour the environment in search for goods, a mission that is facilitated when RJ comes across a mismatched family of forest creatures whom he convinces to help him gather the food he needs from the Suburbian residences just over the hedge.",2006
10,"There's nothing not to like about this fantastic, engaging film--other than the fact that Avril Lavigne is lackluster in her big-screen debut. But her role has little impact on the bigger picture, so it's easy to skip over. Kids and adults will get an equally big kick out of OTH--it provides astute commentary on Americans' gluttonous relationship to food and precarious understanding of the animals that live on the outskirts of our lives; kids will love the brilliant animation, lovable characters and simple yet clever plot. It's a film about good vs. evil, and yes, lessons are learned. But it's far more than just a good way to fill two hours with your kids. I think it'll rank up there as one of Dreamworks' best films to date.",2006
10,"My wife and I were able to attend an advance screening of Over the Hedge, and the two of us thought it was great. I had no idea what DreamWorks was planning to do with the comic strip, but I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a Madagascar or Shrek fan, but this film was actually pretty good and certainly worth my time. I am holding out hope that people who were otherwise on the fence, will decide to see it. Subtle messages about equal treatment, honesty, trust, and friendship are present without being heavy handed. The satire about America's consumer driven economy(particularly in the food industry) is relevant, refreshing, and intelligent. Adults will easily enjoy this film as much as kids, which is no easy task for a cartoon movie. I'm a big classic Disney fan and a lover of animation in general, and my advice to people who have a soft spot for great animation is to take the time to see what's ""Over the Hedge"", my daughter thinks that RJ and Hammy are the two cutest animals ever created. The trailer sells the slapstick humor that will draw its target audience into the theater, but please be aware that this film does in fact have heart and substance. I'm even wondering if the torch will pass from Disney to DreamWorks this year. In either case, Over the Hedge definitely gets my support!",2006
10,"I saw this film in a preview.It's release date is next month. Clever writing and wonderful animation make this movie a ""must see"" for both children and adults. The characters are well defined and the voices are perfect for each character. Some of the humor in the movie may be missed if one doesn't pay full attention to the dialog.There are several messages in the movie. One is a look at consumerism in the United States, another shows that using others for personal gain is a bad idea and lastly the importance of family in our society. The messages are there without this charming movie being preachy. I recommend that families attend the movie together and discuss it afterward.I am looking forward to the sequel!",2006

7,"Like most people, I was convinced that Pixar's ""Cars"" was going to be the animated movie of the year and that ""Over the Hedge"" was just another cheap attempt with the proved formula of cute talking animals.

10,"What can I say? This movie, albeit on the short side at 97 minutes, is one laugh-fest after another. It pokes fun at neighborhood association rules and their sometimes over-zealous presidents, while driving home the message that family is key and of course, it also touches on how new neighborhoods popping up out in the country are driving forest animals into smaller areas, making it harder to find the food they need. Luckily, this is not thrown in your face and is only mentioned once since most of that would go over the kid's heads and would detract from what is actually a slap-stick comedy of animals searching for the ""ultimate"" food.",2006
10,"As a person who doesn't read many comics, I never miss a day of Over the Hedge. The movie doesn't disappoint! The Hammy from the comics really comes alive on the big screen (my favorite part is the Mach 6) and Verne the turtle stays true to his comic character. Some of the characters in the movie never appeared in the comic strip but they fit right in. The movie had enough slapstick for the kids and enough innuendo for the adults. Bringpopcorn because the movie will motivate you to eat junk food but be careful of the soda...at some points it might come out your nose!

Great plot, great characters, and very clever animation. It was very funny, and controlled its humor in a very family matter, so kids of all ages could go see it, and still laugh! I would recommend this film to anyone! It's definitely worth the money! The voices of the characters that were played by a wide range of celebrities fit the critters perfectly. None of the voices seemed off, and everything was on key. The only downside to the movie is that I seriously wish that it was a bit longer. But it is a children's animated film. You can't really expect it to be over 1hr and 30 minutes anyway. But like I said before, It is definitely worth your money and I have doubt that the family will enjoy it.",2006

I love the re-vamped Dr Who, and I was a fan as a child, I grew up with Jon Pertwee as the Doctor and to me he was always the definitive incumbent, until being eclipsed by both the modern incarnations. No, Torchwood is not like Doctor Who, it's a different series; I feel that the characters are very well drawn. They are a team of typical people, they do not have the solutions to all the problems they face, they get scared, they argue, they make mistakes. As far as I see it they behave exactly how most normal people would if recruited and working in a tightly knit team under stressful conditions. There is of course the Russell Davies trademark BLG sexual behaviour, but it is portrayed in a refreshing manner and very much it keeping with the general vibe of the show.",2008

2,"The most difficult part about commenting on Torchwood is avoiding the negatives presented by others. From the bland, unlikeable, inconsistent and undeveloped characters to the uninspired scripts and lame music. Not to mention the silly sexual ambiguity which is just insulting to anyone. It almost seems a prerequisite that to be a member of Torchwood one has to be ready to jump in the sack with either gender. As a sci-fi series some leeway is allowed in believability, but even here Torchwood falls off the tracks. In one scene, Tosh, the most serious of the staff is sitting in a bar when she's hit on by an alien disguised as a human. Before long Tosh is spilling her guts about what it's like to be a member of the most covert government organization in England. Another example of silliness is that the Torchwood team tours Britain in a black SUV with Torchwood written on the roof. But personally, the most disappointing aspect of the show is its billing as adult-oriented. Well take away the tacked on elements of some mild sex scenes, blood splatter and the occasional four letter word and one is left with a kids show suitable for Saturday mornings. For anyone interested in seeing a better show with a similar theme, look for the British series Ultraviolet, which at only six episodes leaves Torchwood in the dust. The two star rating is just for the special effects which are actually decent but on the whole not worth keeping your eyes open for an hour.",2007

8,"I hated the first season of Torchwood, because it lied. It promised to be a dark sci-fi series for adults. All it was was a show that pretended to be adult, with kisses and swears, but felt like a sillier show than Doctor Who, which is a great show, but Torchwood is supposed to be darker.",2008
9,"Now - I have to draw the line at ""camp"" - look, this is a spin off from Doctor Who, and believe me, you can not get anything as camp as the Sylvester McCoy years....",2006
1,"There,s no doubt that the biggest television success story of the last few years has been the resurrection of DOCTOR WHO which has captured the imagination of a whole new generation of fans , children everywhere are looking forward to Christmas because that's the day when the BBC broadcast a Christmas special and should the new version degenerate into the debacle that it was in the 1980s so what ? There's children already converted into die hard fans who will one day be working in television and like Russell T Davies will be in a position to bring back the show . In short the revamped DOCTOR WHO shows that the show is immortal and will certainly out live everyone who saw the very first episode on November the 23rd 1963 ",2006
3,"If Torchwood are above the government and police, why do they scream like girls and run away at the first sign of trouble? If the head of Torchwood 1 was prepared to have Rose shot on the spot simply because she didn't know who she was, how is Ianto still alive? How did Ianto move all that rubbish to Cardiff? Why was he even hired in the first place? He plainly despises everyone for their strong AND weak points, despite their forgiving his utter failure and betrayal.",2006
3,"Having enjoyed the first Doctor Who series and the second one even more, I was really looking forward to this spin-off, especially as it was to be both adult and intelligent. Oh dear! What went wrong? None out of two is not good! Torchwood is supposed to be an organisation dedicated to protecting Earth from the multitude of alien nasties that are able to crawl through a rift in the space-time continuum located in Cardiff, allegedly. I wouldn't use this lot for security in a supermarket! The ""adult"" content - certainly not the plot - is simply swearing and sex scenes. These are thrown at the show (in the hope that they will stick) without doing much to enhance the shaky and derivative plot-lines. The acting is, at times, wooden but I suspect that has more to do with the threadbare scripts and below standard direction. Far from being adult, the swearing and sex reminds me of a naughty child, adding dubious content in order to annoy grown-ups. There is no sense of ""team"" in the Torchwood team. There is no sense that there ever will be... Even in the episode where the inhabitants of a Welsh village were way-laying travellers and eating them, every ten years, there was no sign of intelligent cooperation between the gang. Now, if you have been in that situation, you will know that you have to work together and cover each other's back. I wonder, when Russell T Davies was a child, did his school report card have the comments ""Very disappointing - could do better"" on it. Nothing has changed, Russell.",2007
3,"Oh crumbs, it's really not working is it? I love the old Doctor Who, and happily sat through the first two seasons of the new series despite the odd flaw, misfire and under-par episode. We're halfway through this spin off series however, and despite all the attempts to fit it into Doctor Who's continuity I still have no idea what it's really supposed to be about, beyond the post-watershed teen-titillation and well'ard swearing and gore.",2006
5,"Having watched the first series of ""Doctor Who"" spin-off ""Torchwood"", I'm hooked but also ambivalent about it, hence my average score. My wife picked up on the swearing straight away and said 'Ooh, you can tell that this was written for the post-watershed slots, can't you?' ",2006
8,"is what really makes this series. I've watched it a couple of times now, stories are largely good fun, but the self-sacrificing humanity of the deathless man that is Captain Jack is quite heartbreaking at times and so often, it's his own heart that breaks, but something keeps him going (and the series for that matter).",2009
5,"I have to admit a success on the part of Russell T. Davies! He successfully fooled me, and no doubt countless others, into believing second-in-command Suzie Costello (Indira Varma) would be a regular of the ""Torchwood"" team. But she's not, and that's why she wasn't at the press launch last week and thus absent from the subsequent photo. She was simply a guest in the opening episode, ""Everything Changes"", despite the misleading publicity, appearing with the other five on the cover of the Radio Times and with a profile inside, equal to that of the truly-regular members of the cast. I'm not usually so gullible. At least, I hope not. As soon as I saw Tom Cruise confiding in Max Von Sydow, for example, (the previous evening) early on in ""Minority Report"", I guessed the outcome. For all its SF trappings, Spielberg's film is a very traditional affair. And it isn't as if ""Torchwood"" is the first series to bump off a ""regular"" so soon. I'm sure fans of ""Spooks"" haven't forgotten the almost immediate demise of Lisa Faulkner. So I was taken in, tricked, not surprised exactly because I hadn't really had a chance to get to know the character. Was this ploy meant to endear me to the new series or irritate me into dislike? Alienating the audience is becoming a habit with RTD shows. It happened in the last series of ""Doctor Who"", at least twice, at the beginning of both ""Rise of the Cybermen"", with the humiliation of Mickey, and on arrival in ""The Impossible Planet"", whatever the merits might be of the remainder of those two stories.",2006
10,"Those who expect this to be another doctor who, don't expect to much, it's clearly a low budget BBC production, but it is excellent in the entertaining aspect.",2007
10,"Back in the 1990s British action star Gary Daniels was at the height of his fame. Headlining a string of bland, stunt filled features for PM Entertainment (the B Simpson/Bruckheimer). In 1996 he starred in RAGE, a non-stop action movie with a very ""high concept"" premise. Injected with a deadly drug an ordinary man becomes a one man army. Hunting down the bad guys, on the run from the cops and trying to get his normal life back - the film was stunt filled madness. 10 years later we have CRANK which is essentially a rehash. Albeit a big budget, MTV-style version. Our hero is still a Brit, the location is once again Los Angeles, but there are gangster movie connotations, wild visuals and a tongue-in-cheek tone (you cannot take the name Chev Chelios seriously and I don't think you're supposed to) which makes this a lively, engaging ride which knocks Daniels' effort for six. The similarities between the two cannot be ignored but this is clearly the superior of the two. RAGE was the prototype, but CRANK takes it to the limit with set-pieces and jokes as silly as they are inventive. In addition there are connotations to films such as Tony Scott's MAN ON FIRE and DOMINO and Brit gangster movies such as Mike Hodges' GET CARTER and Guy Ritchie's LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS which add to the thrills and keep us entertained. Much more restrained than CGI-filled, action pantomime that was TRANSPORTER 2, CRANK is Statham's best star vehicle yet. He's a pure physical presence with a maniacal glint in his eyes. There are no Corey Yeun-style martial arts scenes but it doesn't matter. The film is OTT but somehow grounded. The action is rough, fierce. Statham's character is a relentless one man army in classic tradition. Young guys and longtime action movie fans are going to love this for its sheer vigour. With creativity in the genre previously limited to new twists on chases and fight scenes, it's a real pleasure to see films such as CRANK, ONG-BAK and BANLIEUE 13 (District 13) emerging. Not to be taken too seriously, Crank is one of the best popcorn movies of 2006.",2006
8,"If ever a movie was made to get one's heart pumping, Crank is it. It takes a marginally believable and undeniably awesome premise, adds one of the brightest up-and-coming action stars around, stirs in some new ingredients that the genre hasn't really seen before, and bakes until the final product rises beyond all expectations. The catch phrase ""a thrill a minute"" doesn't really go the distance to describe how ridiculously action packed this film is. A thrill every ten to fifteen seconds is more like it. First time directors Mark Nedveldine and Brian Taylor relentlessly bash you over the head with the action hammer. Their cinematography is manic and the style is reminiscent of that used by Tony Scott in Domino. It fits the pace of the film quite well.",2006
9,"I walked into ""Crank"" with low expectations, as I do with many films. The previews made it look like it had a clever story, but I was worried that with Jason Statham playing lead, I might just get a re-hash of his ""Transporter"" films.",2006
9,This is my first review and I've been reluctant to write one because I don't really think anyone will read it... but here it goes.,2006
10,"Crank was... Great. It's was what you hope it might be: Cool, fast, and Jason Statham kicking butt (and Rated R - It's great to hear Statham be able to go off). It was also much funnier than I expected, and once I figured out the tone I was in for the ride. I should've figured out the tone when the movie started with an 80's classic song from Quiet Riot. Or when the director and writer spoke before the movie and thanked ""Jesus"" and then said something like, ""Hold onto your seats, it's going to be f-ckin great."" This movie will probably be considered a cult classic soon. But it could be a huge box office success too. So, here's my story: I was invited to the Cast screening. My friend worked on the crew of Crank, and I got a call Monday morning to go (after another friend had to cancel - I'm always last to get the call, but glad I did TD - So don't worry). I loved Snatch, and I was probably more excited to see Jason Statham in the flesh, than to see the movie. Well, I was simply surprised. Jason was phenomenal. The movie was weird, really good weird. The action never stopped, and right when you were cringing from a needle, or something gruesome, you would be hit with something hilarious. It's was a great blend of action and humor. The writer obviously wrote this tongue in cheek. It was like he was making fun of other films. At least I think so. The movie was subtitled in a couple of random places and I found myself keeled over laughing when the Cab Driver was subtitled. The action really stood out. It was very violent, and at times very real. The bad guy, Verone, also stood out. And I think Amy Smart did a good job playing naive. The movie starts with a bang, and I was surprised that the bang held up to the final scene in the movie, which I think was simply great. My heart is still racing a bit, two days later. Yes, it's that's good.",2006
8,"This movie really is fully packed with action and humor. it has  everything that can keep your heart pumping for the whole movie.  A hit-man chasing and killing bad guys with guns knives and everything  he can find. there is a lot of gunfight and explosives. But the movie  really is funny too. the whole crowd in the theater were laughing out  loud here at the ""avant-premi√®re"" in Montreal.  during the opening sequence, some dizziness begin to overwhelm you  because of a shaky and blurred camera but i guess this is exactly what  the director was expecting. This ""shaky hand"" camera effect is reused  throughout the movie adding to the perspective and helps one get  plunged in the movie.  The special effects are mainly car crashes and explosions, but are  really well executed and very inventive. And the story, well, the story  isn't really what you seek when choosing to go see this kind of movies,  but in crank, the storyline is actually pretty good. It could probably  be resumed in half a page though :)  I would say that it is one of the most balanced humor/action movie i've  seen in the past years.",2006
9,"I love action movies, but they have to be intelligent. No ""The Mummy"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"" for me. Crank nails it in every way.",2006
10,"This is like a roller coaster of a movie . It's fast paced , have a lot of surprises , it's not a politically correct movie . The movie received 3 stars from the movie critic in the Spain's movie magazine Fotogramas. I think that is a fair review, this movie is good and avoid many of the common places in action movies and in many cases go against it .Some of the dialog you hear here you've never heard it in another movie , cause the situations are so unique .Jason Stantham is amazing in the lead character , even giving some comedy moments .This movie don't deserve a direct to video release , but even if in some countries are released direct to video , go and watch it.",2007
8,"Wow, this is surprisingly excellent. I mean, it's crap, but it's good crap, and that's worth a lot. The premise is basically Speed meets D.O.A. (the 1950 movie starring Edward O'Brien). Jason Statham (of the Transporter movies) is a hit-man who has a lethal Chinese poison coursing through his veins. If he slows down, if his adrenaline level drops, he drops dead. In his last moments, he rushes to find his killer and others responsible, snatching as many energy drinks and drugs as he can get his hands on along the way. This is some fun stuff, and hilarious, too. The editing is the MTV-style of many modern action movies, so avoid it if you can't stand that. I hope the directors, who also wrote the script, succeed even more so in the future.",2007
4,"What a disappointment. I really look forward to Jason Statham movies as he has all the tools to be a major action star. He is fit, projects a great screen charisma and knows enough martial arts to allow for nicely choreographed fight scenes. But his movies continue to be weak. Well, his previous movies seemed weak at the time but, compared to this stinker, they rocked.",2007
10,"I thought this movie had it all. Action, humor, and a little bit of sexiness. I thought that they could have gone a different way for the ending, but it was still a unique idea.",2006
1,"There is a scene in this movie where the main character needs a boost of adrenaline, so in the middle of chinatown, he starts ripping off his girlfriend's clothing. She yells ""NO! NO!"" and he continues to rape her. She eventually gives in, and starts liking having sex in public, so it turns out to be okay.",2006
5,"Crank is a deliberately stylized and unrealistic action movie, more concerned with outrageous stunts, flashy editing and smart-ass dialogue than any real movie-making merit. It is not a particularly good film, being alternately too dumb for its own good and too nasty to totally be taken on a good-humoured level. But at the same time, its relentless energy and sheer passion for destruction and mayhem ensures that it lives up to its own unambitious goals, and is an action buffs dream.",2008
1,"Let me start by saying that I usually like crazy action movies with plots that are an afterthought. ""Crank,"" however, was a ridiculous mess, a waste of time, and offensive on top of that. ",2006
1,"I don't know what movie these good reviews are referring to. ""Crank"" was the worst movie I have ever seen on just about every level - and I am a fan of action movies. The only good thing coming out of this movie was how it united the audience and got everyone in the theater lingering after the closing credits to debate just how awful this movie was. ",2006
10,"I can't say I was expecting much when I walked through the door to see Crank. It was my third choice (The Illusionist and Wicker Man were both sold out), but it started soon and despite having heard very little about the film beforehand, I tend to like Jason Statham... So I bought the ticket, and BAM! The surprise of the summer... The action was tight, and just silly enough to make you suspend belief. There were laughs all over the place, adrenaline inducing editing, even a bus full of Japanese school girls... Believe it or not, there were FIVE separate parts where the entire audience broke out into loud applause... It was insane... I walked out of the theater completely satisfied, and vowing to see it again. Which I did, yesterday. Same theater, completely different crowd (a 6PM show on a Monday versus an 11PM show on a Saturday), same result. Cheering, high-fiving between strangers, absolutely unreal. Waiting for my wife to get out of the bathroom afterwards (she, queen of the chick flick, loved it as well), I heard at least 6 different people calling their friends to rave about the movie. Don't believe any of the bad reviews, or people who have yet to see the film commenting on it. Two separate showings, two wildly different theaters full of people (according to the visual inspection I conducted), not a single unsatisfied face from what I could tell. Sure it's a little stupid and silly at times, but it's entertaining the whole way through, just as a summer movie should be.",2006
1,"Seriously. Whoever gave this film 7 to 10 stars is either lying or has no taste in film altogether. Even as a light-hearted romp with an adrenaline junkie, it still blew. I was so confused as to whether or not to care about anyone in that damn film for the entire film.",2007
1,"This (waste of) film is so bad it's not even worth commenting on. I wasted money on this trash cause I had some hope that it might actually be worth seeing, given the fact that the beautiful and talented Amy Smart was co-starring. suffice to say I thought ""Domino"" was one of the worst movies recently made until I saw this piece of s**t. Domino is a masterpiece compared to this film.",2006
2,"I like stylish movies and I like Jason Statham, so I was enthused about seeing this film. After watching the first few minutes, I could see another ""Snatch"" or ""The Transporter"" or a combination of the two with a little ""Pulp Fiction"" thrown in.",2007
1,"""Crank"" is 50 minutes of some of the worst film-making I have ever seen.",2008
1,"This film was conceived, written, scripted, and created.... in 1 day. It's literally a load of fast moving images relating to a vague story with hardcore metal music that was composed purely to make money from people with absolutely no attention spans. Honestly I like mildly entertaining action films but this doesn't deserve the IMDb rating at all.",2006
1,"I didn't expect much and I got a lot less. This is one of the most ridiculously boring ""action"" movie I have ever seen. The ""plot"" is just plain stupid. There's really nothing good I can say about it except that it's over. I wanted to turn it off after the first 10, 15, 20, 25,...etc. minutes into it. But I don't like to enter comments about a movie unless I've seen it through completely. There have been times that I hated the beginning of a movie and then changed my mind by the end of it. It took a few days to watch it completely, but now I see that it was worth it. Now I feel qualified to state that the entire movie is nothing but crap.",2007
1,"ONE of the WORST movies I have ever seen! Enough said! I have been a Jason Statham fan ever since ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"", however since Transporter 2 I have been so disappointed in his movies. Crank is ""Falling Down"" but crap. Some people seemed to like it but as I said it was junk from the get-go. I couldn't associate with the plot or the action and I think this movie is a sad reminder of where Hollywood is trying to go these days. I want to see more movies like ""300"" than this junk. Heck for a blow-em-up, smash bang, psycho thriller I would recommend ""3000 miles to Graceland"" over a dozen ""crank"" style movies any-day! At least 3000 miles was plausible and filmed so much better! Anyway this is my opinion and it is what it is. Voicing it at least made me feel better after this movie's lameness.",2007
9,"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.",2007
9,"Just saw this fantastic film at the Sundance premier and cannot sing its praises enough. Last time I saw Craig Brewer he was singing Ike and Tina to the audience and turning Sundance upside down with his breakout film Hustle and Flow. This time around he fulfills on his big Sundance payday with another unique vision thats going to get everyone talking about Samuel L Jackson, and if you thought Christina Ricci was just that girl in the Addams Family movies then think again. Ricci plays Rae a complete mess of a women who without her beloved Ronnie, played by the getting better all the time Justin Timberlake, has an uncontrollable need for all things sexual. When Ronnie leaves for the a tour with the Army, Rae's demons send her tumbling down a bumpy road that leaves her used and abused left for dead on the side of the road. Along comes old blues-man Lazarus played by the great Samuel L Jackon, Lazarus himself has a few demons lurking around in his head as well, notably his ex-wife who done wrong by him. Lazarus gets to think about this young women and after some soul searching he takes it upon himself to cure her evil ways with some love, some lessons and a 40 lb. chain. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll just say there's some dark moments, some very funny moments and whole lot of great acting. This movie isn't by any means Hustle & Flow 2, however Craig Brewer does tie the two films together with his hope for redemption and change for the better for even the most unlikely of people. Audiences will find a movie worth watching here and worth thinking about well after it ends.",2007
7,"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly John Cothran Jr as Reverend R. L.. I'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.",2007
8,"We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too ""heavy"" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.",2007
9,"Just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... ""skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator"" ... I hate when ""critics"" miss the point of a film. Now I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too. It may also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple ""redemption tale"" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is highly effect as a ""blues"". It would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past ""Snakes on a Plane"" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable Mid-South blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. Not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes I will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!",2007
8,"If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously, there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it.",2007
6,"I'll be honest with you; this is not the type of movie that I'm usually drawn to. All you have to do is watch the trailer and read the plot summary to figure out where you stand. But just to continue this honest streak, I have to admit that Jackson and Ricci are so good in their roles, that they were able to pull me into the story and keep a grip on my interest.",2007
10,"I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.",2007
8,"Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.",2007
9,"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.",2007
6,"This movie had a notion to be something gritty and provocative, but with all its dirty talk and soft-core sex, ends up being some kind of white-trash fairy tale where the fairy godmother is a black semi-legendary bluesman who's having his own crisis of faith. If you don't automatically flash to Robert Johnson down at the crossroads, there are some clips of Son House talking about the real meaning of the blues. Stereotypes abound in ""Black Snake Moan"" which isn't a bad thing when you're trying to create an allegory for race relations down in the delta and how much nobler rural southern blacks are than their ignorant immoral white counterparts. Having grown up (white) in the south in the 50s and 60s, I know there's quite a bit of truth in that.",2007
9,"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator. It is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone.",2007
8,"In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.",2008
10,"If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan.",2007
7,"The title of this film, ""Black Snake Moan"" refers to a really old song by country blues musician, Blind Lemmon Jefferson in which, the singer talks about his sexual addiction and his moans for love, once more. Full of explicit sexual nuances, Jefferson's song full of unconventional melodic style and utilization of double entendres, was able to fly pass the radar of censorship, back in the 1920s. As much, I like how Jefferson was able to pioneer this style of music. I have to say, actor, Samuel Jackson sings the song, so much better than Blind Lemmon Jefferson, ever did. Jackson was really able to update the song to fit with this new generation with his electric guitar playing, deep shouting gravitas voice, and depth of his character's backstory. It was very moving part of the film. Honestly, most of this movie is very compelling with its controversial subjects that include but are not limited to rape, sexual addiction, parental abuse, anxiety disorders, and religious outlooks. Without spoiling this polarizing film, too much, I have to say, I kinda like the story of the grumpy hermit/ former Blues singer, Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to rebuild his life after a nasty divorce, while also, trying hard to cure, a known nymphomaniac, Rae Doole (Christina Ricci) from her faults. It made for a very well-told story. I love all the metaphors and symbolism that this film has to offer, too. A good example of one is the chain that Rae wears around her waist, during most of the film and the type of shirt, she is wearing. If you don't realize it, already Rae represented the South, and its struggles, after the American Civil War. Not only, does her chain, represented the heavy weight of learning to live, with the mistakes and haunts of the past, but her chained up character is also stand-in, for the continuous, ignored issue of modern day slavery. After all, the region, is known for being a strong bible belt, but it also been known to keep that belt unbuckled when it comes to the dangers of having too lust, over the sense of love. The high reports of human trafficking, sexual abuse, and sex slaves is signed of that. Although, the chain can represented, something bad and naughty, it also can somewhat represented the unity that the South has, with its supply chain, when it comes to addressing the issue, in hand. There is no bigger metaphor of that, than the radiator in which Lazarus chain up Rae. It represented, the ever changing social climate of the South, as conflicts can indeed heat up, or cool down. No matter, how far, you run away from your issues. You will always been weighted down, by what society, thinks and wants from you. It's only, when you able to address the past, and learn to live with yourself, in a moral life, is when the removal of the chain, can be seem, as a meaningful step toward a better future. Another thing, I like about this film is that Lazarus, isn't a mysterious 'magical black negro' type character with no backstory, nor does Rae represented the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' that is there to save his soul. In many ways, both characters are well-defined, with each, having their own issues to deal with, on their own, with or without the help from the other. Nobody is depended on the other, at all. Like Lazarus's namesake, it's about the redemption and resurrection of two, clearly mess up people. However, people might not see that, through the film's poster and exploitation marketing. The way, they market, this movie makes it, seem like a more like a porno than a character study film. It really does overblows the potential fetish fuel of the film, at the expense of everything else. It's not the best. Don't get me wrong, Christina Ricci is one, attractive woman, but her character wasn't made, just for nudity and fan service. She really, put some work, in showing how ugly and unhealthy, Rae can really be. She really does look pale and pasty. Even Samuel L. Jackson, ugly himself up, by letting his hair grow out, not dying or shaving, to show, how wash-up, his character has become. Both actors, really made their character, their own. I also have to give, mad props to both, the supporting actors in this film. Justin Timberlake as Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie was great. He really was, able to show his character emotional crutch, with the way, his body language moves. He really did seem like he suffers from extreme social anxiety. It really shows Hollywood, that the then-newly made solo singer can indeed, acted. Another person that need some praise is Michael Raymond-James as Ronnie's friend, Gill Morton. He was able to show both, his loving cares and hateful lust for Rae, making his performance, a very sympathetically real-life person. Even thought, he tries to make advances on Rae, which is a no-no, in my picture; I still can understand, what stress, he had to deal with when dealing with mess up people who supposed to be your friends. Overall: While, still many viewers will undoubtedly be offended by director Craig Brewer's representation of a still-segregated, racist South; I have to say, I love how the film acknowledges the importance of sex, while also highlighting the danger of having sex irresponsibly, all without being too heavy-handed and preachy. I also cherish the film, for its use of 'Delta Blues' type music and how well-shot, it was. In the end, this clever morality tale about two unlikely characters is a must-watch. I do recommended. It's pleasantly amazing.",2016
3,"It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether director/writer Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) is trying to satirize the Southern Gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way, he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist appropriately named Lazarus who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as over-the-top as the premise, then it might have had a fighting chance, but as it stands, Brewer is too ensconced in his chicken-fried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.",2007

8,"(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus gives medical care to Rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.",2007
10,"I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!! The movie is about many things...people say that is religious...people say that it's about racism...people say that is about drugs...people say that is about nymphomania...well...maybe is a little bit of all that!! But what I truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is...what it stands for...and mainly were it comes from: life...heart...pain...sorrow...and above all...spontaneous feelings!! I hope you get to see it...if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells...this is a good movie to see...if your not...well...see it anyway...cant hurt that much, and you get to see Christina Ricci acting so horny!! She's a fox!!",2007
10,"This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it's gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. Isn't that the best reason to see a movie? Those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week.",2007
10,"If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing. Perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in the abundant profane will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart. From the pumping pounding follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred.",2007
7,"A fantastic elevation of his southern-fried cinema form, Craig Brewer proves that there's a lot more to the durty south then rappers and pimps with his exciting and unique third feature Black Snake Moan. Replacing the crunked- up template that helped garner Hustle & Flow all of it's gritty praise, Brewer shifts the focus to a way older musical tradition in the South, the Blues. Proving the opposite of a one-trick-pony, this noticeable young writer and director weaves a potent spell of sleaze, laughter, terror, and redemption around Samuel L. Jackson's troubled, God-fearing bluesman and his fateful meeting with quite the tortured young lady.",2007
8,"Well worth the ticket price, Black Snake Moan offers audiences a well-written, overall enjoyable movie. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci both play believable versions of their characters, and honorable mention to Justin Timberlake, who filled his role with credibility. The setting is very realistic, both inside and outside scenes, and the costuming/makeup is on par with the rest of the film's production standards. The story tests viewers with initial questionability, wanting you to choose either Ricci's or Jackson's character as your hero, and leaving you feeling fulfilled either way. A healthy exercise in modern cinema and acting, Black Snake Moan comes highly recommended to anyone curious about it.",2007
8,"I was surprised by how great Black Snake Moan turned out to be.Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson id figure id give this a try.Well when this was over I was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.I mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer(who made Hustle & Flow another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.Well, I like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.Also I love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.The cating in this was just phenomenal especially from Christina Ricci(who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job as well.Overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three Cheers For Black Snake Moan!!!!",2008

8,"Today, I am a happy gorehound. I've just seen ""Slither,"" and it was a truly good time! OK, let's face it... this one isn't going to win any awards for originality. The story here is ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"" with hints of ""The Blob,"" David Cronenburg's ""Shivers,"" and a more-than-passing special effects nod to Brian Yuzna's ""Society."" But it WORKS here.",2006
9,"It is absolute fun, plain and simple. It gets in, does it scares and it's laughs, and gets out quick. As what it was meant to be, it was absolutely brilliant. It does its own thing, and it does it perfectly, and the result is pure entertainment, nothing more. So, if you like movies like Shaun of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Dead Alive, Gremlins, Tremors, or anything in that vein, you will like this movie.",2006
8,"First off, I'm a horror nut and no matter what anybody else says, this is NOT a rip-off of ""Night of the Creeps"" or ""The Deadly Spawn"". James Gunn himself said at a recent Fangoria Weekend of Horrors in Chicago that the only film that played a part in ""Slither"" was David Cronenberg's ""They Came from Within"" (AKA - ""Shivers""). There's a blatant homage to it that fans of the Cronenberg film will spot right away, and that's cool. That what James Gunn is about. You forget, this is a guy from the house that Kaufman built - Troma. Nods and inside jokes abound in ""Slither"". It's a horror movie for real horror movie fans. Slimy, not gory. Funny, not insipid. ""Slither"" is the next logical step from the guy who wrote the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"". It's a little more fun, a lot less serious, and features a great cast that makes this movie what it should be - hugely entertaining. Perfect, no. But it sure is fun and makes you look forward to what he'll do next.",2006

The slug stops moving as Grant moves closer, he becomes infected by the slug. Grant begins to change and evolve into a bloodthirsty meat-eating squid creature with a need to kill to maintain his life. Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and Starla must defeat this creature or the entire earth will be consumed.",2006

I had seen the trailer for this 2 months back play before a movie two months back but forgot all about it until I was at the con and saw there was going be a special screening. Me and my wife had to see it. We love horror and this was our first time being at a special screening. So we were both jazzed.,2006
10,"I got to see this movie at it's LA premiere on a fluke -- I was interested in the star, Nathan Fillion, and got in when someone had extra tickets -- and I have to say, from the previews I wasn't that impressed. They just didn't appeal to me.",2006

7,"In case you're a loyal fan of horror movies, I'm pretty sure you've already heard (and probably even USED) the clich√© saying in this comment's subject line. We sometimes get the impression that the only horror films Hollywood serves us nowadays are uninspired slashers and colorless remakes, all staring untalented bimbos and washed up hip hop stars that urgently need to boost up their careers by playing a film role. For all these reasons (and many more), James Gunn's ""Slither"" is an immensely joyful movie to observe, as it's a genuine homage to the cheesy, gooey and especially GORY old-school horror days! Gunn's fluently written script catapults us straight back to the 1980's, with its typical little town setting, witty redneck characters and ¬ñ above all ¬ñ make up effects that don't rely on advanced computer techniques. The story opens when an evil alien monster crash-lands his ""eggshell"" in the woods and literally invades the body of local town figure Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). Grant then impregnates a slutty townsgirl and she ""gives birth"" to thousands of eerie slugs that go on infecting the rest of the villagers. Grant's loving wife Starla teams up with the Sheriff, who's also her biggest admirer, to battle the slugs and prevent total elimination of the hunting town's population. Judging by James Gunn's age and background, he grew up during one of the golden eras of horror and this is clearly noticeable by the amount of tributes and references he put into his own film! Little aspects and gimmicky ideas from ""Basket Case"" over ""The Blob"" onto ""Tremors"" all feature in ""Slither"" and yet never at one point the film becomes overly hectic or stupid. It doesn't contain much tension or originality, but that largely gets compensated by the imaginative splatter. Grant gradually turns into a large-sized pile of slimy smut (similar to Brian Yuzna's ""Society"") that sucks innocent villagers into his stomach...or something like that. Other people get their head blown to pieces by a shotgun, or entirely eaten by the slugs and one poor sucker is even cut in half by Grant's tentacles. The dialogues are often hilarious, particularly the mayor is quite a character, and the cast members all seem very happy to be a part of this production.",2006
7,"Wow! What a fun and engaging movie. This film packs more punch and originality in its presentation that any comedy horror since ""Dead Alive"". If you are a horror fan like me YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. The acting is well-done and the comedy is blended perfectly. If you like body piercing alien tentacles, and slimy slugs crawling down your throat and controlling your brain, this movie's for you. Every scene is a homage to great cult classics and hits its target audience in the head with a 50 pound bag of fun dropped from the Empire State Building. Granted, I'm no film expert but I am an avid moviegoer and I give this one a very anti-ebert 2 thumbs up (16 tentacles and 100,000 slugs). The reason this movie isn't rated higher is simply it's not a great or a classic by any means. It is just a no-holds-barred good time, and sometimes thats the best time you can have in the confines of a movie theater with a fat red haired woman sitting next to you chomping her week-size tub of extra buttered popcorn and screaming every time she sees the firefly guy in danger. ....sigh....7/10",2006

10,"I would highly recommend this to anybody who thinks 'Sci-Fi Horror Comedy' is good fun. This movie contained elements from some of my favorite movies: The Blob, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, and a little bit of The Thing. The plot has a slow build but never fails to lose your interest. Every time you think you know what's going on the script moves in a new direction until you arrive at the truly bizarre climax. The acting is a little weak from the star (Elizabeth Banks) but the rest of the cast is pretty solid and any Joss Whedon fans will recognize the Firefly captain Reynolds in a great role as the sheriff. The special effects work well without being flashy or huge-budget and some of the gross-out scenes are as stomach-churning as you could hope for. Throw in gratuitous profanity, one-liners, and redneck hicks, and you've got the perfect recipe for an alien-zombie-romance-comedy classic. A bit of the bonus for the guys-- there is a chance your girlfriends will like this one too thanks to a well-executed underlying theme of love conquering all. But they better not mind some horrific violence along the way. As a general fan of any kind of horror-comedy, I can't help but give Slither an A+.",2006
6,"I think I might enjoy the comedy/horror genre more than the actual horror films they parody. James Gunn, (yes, the man who brought us what I can only imagine are fantastic scripts for Scooby Doo 1 & 2¬ónot sure since I would never watch them), has broken into the mix with his film Slither. It appears he understands the appeal these films have and jam-packs it with gore, camp, and humor. The audience can never wonder if what transpires is unintentionally funny because they are too busy thinking about the parts that are unintentionally scary. A comedy, through and through, Gunn gathers a nice group of actors to play up the cheese yet still make us believe they are smack in the middle of the otherworldly situation they are in.",2007
10,No spoilers in here.,2006
1,"Movie is an insult to the Jimmy Caan 70s flick of the same name; and to the audience. Gunn makes great play of it being a homage to just about EVERY horror movie (read 'rip-off'), even down to referencing characters and directors - big deal - Brundle's Meat - so what? And thinks he is making something neat and smart and knowing - but the flick just deteriorates into a dull ZOMBIE movie. Like we need another one of those. He wastes Rooker's superlative talents by turning him into a motionless blob; and offs the sorely underused Greg Henry. Leaving us with what? Nathan Fillion and staggering zombies. If Gunn could have spent some time being less pleased with himself, maybe he could have ironed out the glaring plot holes - for example, why do one horde of zombies become 'Grant' - talk like him, think like him; but the gal's entire family DON'T. Stupid. Also, check this - less is more. I found ONE slug in my kitchen the other day. It freaked me out. Gunn's gazillions of the critters didn't one iota. Lame. Limp. Not funny. Not scary. He's put the good cause of horror back twenty years. Oh, and Gunn 'F**k you fat-ass' is not good dialogue, neither is 'this is some f**ked up sh*t'. Stick with Troma and Scooby Doo, it's about your level.",2006

With time passing, Grant becomes more violent, disfigured and bizarre. The murderers and missed people starts to increase. How much time will take to people notice he changed?",2007
5,"Slither is the sort of film that's easy to pitch but relatively tough to pull off. The amalgamation of gory, schlocky horror with comedy; usually of a dark and farcical nature, seems to be the name of the game here, but they don't quite connect. I do think American director James Gunn has a better film inside of him, one that's more mature and less plodding, one that's more focused; one that can combine his 'eye' for the ability to get the maximum out of an icky horror infused scenario with content a tad more interesting for the audience than some grotesquely obese alien-human hybrid's love for his former wife. Regardless, in a recent world full so many daft horror remakes and Saw sequels; I can see why a 'fun' B-movie homage has been seen as such a welcoming tonic. ",2010

1,"There must be literally hundreds of excellent films being made throughout the world every year and yet utter garbage like this is getting distributed in the UK. For some unknown reason the British press seems to be giving this stinker good reviews, which is why we decided to go and see it in the first place. The film is obviously trying be a tongue in cheek but unfortunately all it is is a charmless piece of junk. The script tries to throw in amusing one liners along the way, every one of which fell flat on its face. The whole audience sat throughout without so much as one ripple of amusement and we left feeling that we had both wasted our money and our time by going to see this. OK, I admit that I would probably have enjoyed the special effects when I was 13, but now I feel insulted being offered dross like this as entertainment. It really is time that a few more worthy films started being shown in British cinemas, alas, having seen the trailers for coming releases I fear that this will never be....

I expected nothing, yet in return, I received a wonderful 1 hour and 40 minute respite from the real world, filled with slapstick humor and total silliness. Slapstick humor always walks a tightrope between bad taste and belly laughs. The Three Stooges are mind-numbingly inane: most laugh intensely and some never get the joke. Laurel and Hardy isn't for everyone either. Nacho Libre is not filled with Woody Allen irony, it doesn't have Christopher Guest's drollness, and it's not James Brook slick. It's not sophisticated humor! How can any film featuring Jack Black as a Mexican friar/fryer/wrestler/wannabe wooer ... all for the ""good of the orphans"" be taken seriously? It's simply for the 12 year old boy in all of us who laughs when Moe hits Curly and laughs when fat guys, even with over the top Mexican accents, are paired with skinny guys ... in a wrestling ring ... with stretchy pants.",2006

Once I found where this movie was coming from, it had me LOL and getting a few glances from others more interested in the food. Let me explain. Its not gag, punchline funny and was never intended to be. The understated dryness of visual gags and 'dead pan' delivery of dialog makes this movie totally ridiculous and a crack up! Black is great and pulls off some excellent poses. The movie is clever and artistically shot, adding even more depth to the humour. At worst this movie has a few slow spots, but it is peppered with some great 'laugh till there is dribble running out the side of your mouth' slapstick.",2007

Jack Black may at times go over the top but he more than makes up for it with some moments of real genius. Besides the obvious jokes there's an intelligent, awkward humor here for those who look for it. Some critics are saying the plot is too predictable. C'mon. This is often an issue with critics trying to take storytelling in comedies too seriously. If a comedy succeeds in making you laugh all the way through, who the heck cares?

7,"""Nacho Libre"" contains much of the same dry, deadpan humor that made ""Napoleon Dynamite"" so much fun to watch. I'm sure Jared Hess's brand of humor is not for everybody. We're living in an era where Dane Cook is our top comedian. So if you're expecting the same loud, obnoxious gags you see in most comedies nowadays, you'll probably be disappointed. I, on the other hand, love this type of humor. Just like in ""ND,"" the actors don't try hard to be funny. Jack Black is not very convincing as a Mexican. With his skin so white, he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the rest of the cast. But that's no big criticism. This is a comedy farce, and if his accent didn't sound so phony, I doubt his character would be nearly as funny. As an extra treat for all the ""ND"" fans out there, his character is paired off with a soft-spoken Mexican buddy. They make a good comic team, with Jack being so short and fat, and his buddy being so tall and thin. I tend to just roll my eyes at many of the crude gags I see in movies nowadays, but I even enjoyed the bathroom humor in this movie. I found myself laughing most of the way through, and this is one of the rare cases where I felt that the film lived up to its trailer. Some of the funniest gags were given away in the trailer, but there are many other funny gags that weren't. If I have any complaints, the movie does sort of drag in the third act. But all in all, ""Nacho Libre"" is good fun for the entire family. I can't wait to see Jared Hess's next project.",2006
6,"I saw this movie last night at a screening on the Paramount lot. There are some laughs throughout, but the writing isn't particularly great.

It was not racist either...anyone who thinks that is probably a very annoying person in general.",2008

Whenever a film has to resort to a fart to make the audience laugh, there just isn't much to entertain you. Jack is an actor that feeds off support and he had none in this film. He was literally walking the plank while trying to deliver humor. Good guy triumphs and everyone leaves with a warm fuzzy feeling. I left wondering why Jack Black took the part. I think the idea was to come up with a new ""Napoleon Dynamite"" for the Summer but this one fell short.",2006
6,"I have fallen asleep every time I watch Napoleon Dynamite. Without fail. But aside from embarrassing myself to every reader, I have to say that I did not mind Nacho Libre at all. The dialog is fine yes, and fart jokes are strategically, if not diabolically, placed from scene to scene. But Nacho is very much a visual film. A treat for the eyes where, with the obvious exception of Ana de la Reguera, actors are not beautiful or glamorous or drowned out in makeup but are real. Their faces have more expressive character than anyone in Hollywood does and, with that foundation, you can build a comedy around that, package it, and let the talent do the rest. With that in mind, I have to say Nacho Libre is a fantastic movie in its own right and Jack Black, well, he just runs wherever the script lets him.",2006
10,For this to be the first film i register and leave a comment for then it must be good.!!!! Best comedy i think i have seen this year. Jack black cant do a great accent all the time but its all-round great and he really makes this film stand out as being hilarious. Typical boy meets girl. Boy tries to impress girl. Finds out she doesn't like this and that .so on and so forth. There is hidden depth to this film. I will buy it when it comes to DVD. ,2006
2,I hope that Jack Black and every person involved with the production of this movie has my home address so they can send me a written apology for my time spent in the theatre. What do you do when you just had a big hit movie and one more joke? You get a backer and make a one note bad film.,2006
9,"Nacho Libre Jack Black......a guitarist, singer, rocking out for the School Of Rock, and many other parts. Now.....he is a man of god....who happens to become a wrestler.",2006
2,"Tedious, slow, boring, Jack Blacks meandering accent¬ÖThese are just a few of the things I noticed almost immediately. If those people smiled that ridiculous smile one more time I think I would have screamed and pulled my hair out. There are moments that you could chuckle but they come so few and far between that by the time it comes around again you've settle into a nice deep sleep. Toward the end during the ""big fight"" it wanders into ""Rocky"" territory with the guy getting beat up then conquering in the end and that is the most entertaining part of the movie. Personally I liked Napoleon Dynamite and expected to like this because I can appreciate some of what Jack Black has done in the past. However, this was so painful I really felt angry about going. I think now I'm going to watch Gigli and see if it is much worse.",2006
1,"I have followed Jack Black's performances since Cable Guy with great interest so i was really hoping to fall in love with his latest creation, Nacho, a monk who longs to be a luchador, however this was not to be. Nacho Libre is wrong on so many levels, firstly Jack Black waltzes through this film with a rehashed school of rock performance, full of zany stomping, crazy faces and an awful Mexican accent which slips during his Tenacious D episodes, which are peppered throughout the film. Secondly the script seems like an afterthought with real gags few and far between. (I laughed more watching Titanic than i did in this 'comedy'!) With every minute that passed in this film i grew more ill at ease but don't take my word for it... go see this horror for yourself! be afraid... be very afraid!",2006
10,"This movie is hilarious and anyone who doesn't agree, doesn't get it. This movies genre of humor may come off as immature and pointless, but I think if you know enough about comedy, you'll love and really understand why this movie is great. I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but his character is outstanding. I wouldn't make this movie a novel or a musical, but I will laugh every time Esqueleto chucks corn into that old guy's eye socket. It is easy to see that this movie took time ,and effort to ensure that it was hysterical (ex. scenes ending abruptly, fake and cheesy sound effects, Ignacio's songs). I would also like to add that this movie is made to be racist, but maybe you might see it as that if you are racist yourself. I'm not a movie expert, but I love this movie, and I appreciate movies that are actually funny.",2011
8,"Nacho Libre is one of those movies that is funnier every time you watch it. In general, comedies these days are hilarious the first time...but downright lame the second time. This is not so for Nacho Libre. Mostly, I believe this is true because Nacho does not involve a whole lot of surprise humor. It rarely throws a joke or a circumstance at you when you are not expecting it. Instead, it focuses on facial expressions, goofy one-liners, and slapstick blunders.",2011
8,"If you are familiar with my reviews, you know I'm a huge Mike White fan and you also know that Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is aces in my book. And it's no news to anyone on the planet that Jack Black ain't no slouch either. Put them all together, throw in some adorable orphans, a career-confused monk, a sexy nun, some funny face masks, a wrestling ring or two, some stretchy pants and the country of Mexico, and you've got Nacho Libre. ",2006
7,"Nacho Libre is good family entertainment. That pretty much wraps up the film in a nutshell. Does this mean it's a kids film? No, not really, I have no kids and enjoyed it, but that doesn't mean that kids that see it won't be cracking up either. The humor in this film is a bit more from the toilet, there are lots of funny accents and there's wrestling. You can't find a better formula for kids.",2006

5,"Bryan Singer has made it no secret that he was going to make this film a sequel of sorts to the first two Superman films which starred Christopher Reeve. Which I though was an interesting idea even though I thought Superman 2 was lame. However, I thought the premise of Superman returning after a long absence was a great idea, unfortunately Singer's heavy reliance on the first two films really crippled this film.",2006
7,"Superman Returns (2006), in my opinion, is one of the most underrated superhero films to come out of the twenty-first century. This film came out ten years ago and has never gotten the respect it deserves. One of the best elements of this film is its heart. This film out of all the films that were released from 2000 to 2010 do not match the amount of heart and soul of this film. Batman Begins (2005) does come close. Not many superhero films deal with adult themes of loss, isolation, and returning to a home and finding their place in the world. Finding yourself is never easy, and Superman goes through the a emotional and physical journey throughout.",2016
9,"This was my first movie to see Superman on the big screen, before I saw ""Man of Steel"" when it came out seven years later. I never saw any of the old films in theaters, but only saw them on TV. After when this movie came out, critics enjoyed it, audience have mixed feelings, and sadly didn't go well at the box-office which it all leads up to another reboot instead of a making a sequel. So, does this movie hold up or does it really deserves to be forgotten? Here it goes: the movie acts as a sequel to the first two movies, while it ignores Lester's concept for ""Superman II"" and ignoring the third and fourth movie. However, the movie takes place in modern time, instead of taking place in the late 70s or early 80s. Furthermore, it tells about Superman making his return from searching the remaining of his home world Krypton as he has been gone for five years, while Lex Luthor is wanting to destroy Superman and creating ""land"" of his own. Also, Lois Lane has moved on from Superman as she wrote the article which it completely shocks Superman for her receiving a Pulitzer Prize on her work called ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" So, how is that movie? As much as I love ""Man of Steel,"" and I am glad that its getting a sequel; but at the same time, I wish if this movie got a sequel. There are possible reasons on why this movie failed because of either the movie wasn't marketed really well; it is due to other movies that came out the same date as this or probably is that everyone in this world weren't ready for having Superman to be brought back, because of ""Batman Begins"" came out a year before this came out in 2006. I guess people weren't ready to see another ""Superman"" movie, because they were very much in the mood for having Batman to come back. Also, a 6.1 on IMDb is really low, which I think is unfairly treated, and I think the movie just needs a little love. I know ""Man of Steel"" got a 7.2, which its good; so, why can't this one have a good rating like ""Man of Steel"" or the other two good ""Superman"" movies? Just saying. I don't think this movie deserve the hate it gets. I remember that Bryan Singer just drop off to direct the third ""X-Men"" movie, so he can direct this one instead. I know he wants to direct the third ""X-Men"" movie, but Fox just ended up not being patience so they can make the movie without him as Brett Ratner directs it instead. Difficult choice, if I may say so. Anyway, I will admit that the premise of the movie feels similar to Richard Donner's movie like Lex Luthor wants billions of people to die. You think they should at least try something new and different. Also, which its a minor nitpick, I don't mind Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane but they could at least find someone better to play Lois Lane. She is like the equivalent of Katie Holmes from ""Batman Begins"" because she looks slightly young to play the role. Nevertheless, I thought she did a fine job, but could of been someone better to play Lois Lane. Also, compare to ""Man of Steel,"" the movie may have some fine action scenes but I wish if it had more action scenes so the filmmakers don't have to stick by the books on making a traditional ""Superman"" movie like the others. So those are my only issues with the movie. What is good? I thought Bryan Singer's direction was actually really, and has a very unique to style on how he wants this movie to be. Aside from Bosworth, the rest of the cast all did good. I thought Kevin Spacey makes an excellent Lex Luthor, but also updating from the role that Gene Hackman played originally. For Brandon Routh, I thought the look of him for not only looking like the part for playing both Clark Kent and Superman, but that he looks very much like Christopher Reeve. He really does give an outstanding performance, and was able to channel the role very wisely. The special effects are really good, which that takes care of the lame FX from ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."" I do appreciate some of the nods to the original movies by Donner like having Marlon Brando as Jor-El, its wondrous moments, and of course, hearing the theme song by John Williams. John Ottman's score is very well done for paying respect to Williams' score and making new material on his own. I wasn't bored by the movie as it goes at a good pace, and I did get teary eye from the part that Superman gets beat up Luthor's men as it makes me think of Jesus getting whipped by the Romans. Of course, other comic book movies may have some religious aspects like what this movie did. I do like where Superman tells Lois, when he says that she wrote the article that doesn't need a savior, but he hears everyday when people are crying for one which that many Christians will feel about that. With that said, I think ""Superman Returns"" deserves another look, and I do think its close enough to be as underrated as ""Man of Steel."" I enjoy it, and I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.",2015
5,"""Superman Returns"" is a competent movie, generally very well produced, directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points, as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. Alas, I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavy-handed emotional scenes; what sort of catchphrase is ""I'm always around,"" anyway? ",2006
5,"After languishing in the disappointment that was Brett Ratner's X3, I made it a point to walk into Superman Returns with low expectations. They should have been lower. It isn't that the film is outright terrible (though it has many glaring flaws); rather, I had unknowingly outgrown the Superman myth. And considering that Bryan Singer offers nothing original to the new installment, I think America will find its timeless icon a little dated.",2006

8,"I became curious enough to re-watch this movie after seeing Brandon Routh's performance as Ray Palmer/A.T.O.M. in Arrow, Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow. ",2016
8,"I was totally surprised and blown away by this movie! First of all, Superman Returns takes you back to the original cinematic universe of Superman 1 and 2. When the movie started and I realized that, I was pretty skeptic, I didn't believe that it could work 26 years after Superman 2 (actually it was 36 years, when I was watching it). Then when Clark Kent returned to the Daily Planet, and I saw that the actor (Brandon Routh) is actually doing Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent, I was like ""Oh no, this will be bad!"". The same thing with the young photographer, Jimmy Olsen - the actor was playing the exact same character. I didn't like the concept. But then I said to myself, okay, I'm gonna go with it, so I kept watching the movie, and very shortly I had to realize that it actually works! It was funny, it was exciting, it was emotional - it was everything that a classical Superman movie needs to be! Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was amazing! She was actually not trying to copy Margot Kidder, she was doing her own thing, but still remained Lois Lane. I would say, as far as acting goes, Kate Bosworth was the best thing in this movie. ",2016
9,"Superman Returns is basically the 3rd in the series since it picks up from where Superman II left and it completely erases Superman III and Superman IV: Quest For Peace but it's the fifth film in the series and it's directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2: United, X-Men: Days Of Future Past) and starring Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel. Is this film as bad as everyone says? No! is it the best Superman film in the saga? No! The 1978 film and Man of Steel remain the best for me and i think as a film is good for what it is sure it has some things that don't make sense and the acting isn't all that perfect but as a movie as a Superman movie is pretty good it has good effects and a great Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor who is as good as Gene Hackman was in the first 2 films. Superman Returns might not be perfect or even awesome as the first film was but is definitely better than that 6.1 that IMDb gave it.",2015
1,"First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. ",2006
1,"This movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological. I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater, their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes -- eyes wandering at their neighbor, wondering if it was just them. I mean, how could the movie really be bad. Nobody'll admit it, it's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. ""Who am I to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner?"" But the fact remains, every member of the audience is thinking what I'm writing right now. I actually plagiarized their faces.",2006
6,"I saw the original ""Superman: The Movie"" when it was released in theaters. It was an epic event. It would be unfair to expect the same from ""Superman Returns"" but the filmmakers are inviting comparisons since they rely so much on certain events that occurred in the first two films, even going so far as to reuse some of Tom Mankiewicz's dialog. It's obvious when watching the film that a lot of money and hard work went into making it...with the exception of the screen writing which is where this film falls short. It insists on making several characters dumber than they would appear. Take Richard, concerned about an old article Lois wrote called ""I spent the night with Superman"". Richard boy, she has a kid. She obviously spent the night with SOMEONE before she met you. If you really stop and consider it, every character in the film is basically commanded by the script to do something kind of dumb in order to advance the unimaginative story.",2006
4,Special effects? Good.,2006
1,"This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very poor acting, outrageous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To summarize : Superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh) , doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), takes off in a spaceship (?!?),comes back i think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? Please !!",2006

4,"Let me start by saying that I was SO looking forward to seeing this movie despite reading some of the not so great reviews on this site. I trusted the people who gave it high marks and made it sound like it was as good as or better than the original. My husband had doubts going in, but he is a HUGE comic book fan, so I figured he was just being picky. Boy was I WRONG! When we left the theater (which was surprisingly empty by the way) there were a few faint claps and absolutely no conversation. Usually when a movie is good you hear a few ""Wow, that was great!"" comments when you are leaving. I heard complete silence. Out of respect, both my husband and I left the movie theater without saying a word. It wasn't until we got in our car and shut the doors that my husband finally burst out and said, ""God that was horrible!!!""",2006
1,"I am a huge movie fan and I am hard pressed to tell of a film that I didn't enjoy just a little, until now. I loved the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, even the one with Richard Pryor. I was so disappointed with this film. Brandon Routh does a good job portraying the physical presence of Superman and I think he is a decent actor, but they don't give him enough to do. Kevin Spacey is evil as Lex Luthor, but nothing exciting. Parker Posey (I am definitely a fan of her work, Mighty Wind anyone?) is terribly under utilized. Kate Bosworth is no Margot Kidder and James Marsden is just plain boring. There were so many long sequences of Superman flying and thunder rolling and seas thrashing and not enough of a plot. Where is the romance or the comic relief or something? I know everyone is going to say, ""But this is a new Superman movie"". The movie is called Superman Returns and it supposed to pick up where the last movie left off, so it should have at least had something of a tangible connection to those films. I would like a refund and so would the other 20 people with whom I spoke outside the theater, including my two children. Crap, total crap!!!!",2006
7,"Superman's back and there's gonna be trouble, hey na, hey na, Superman's back! Well, hey, if Batman can begin again, Supes can come back to Earth, so to speak, right? Only this time it's not the late Christopher Reeve or even George Reeves, it's relative newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man o' Steel. Seems he's been gone lo these past five years in deep space, checking the general vicinity of where Krypton once existed. (Astronomers reported they'd found traces of the planet, so off Superman went to check out his home; oddly, neither he nor the astronomers mentioned that he was leaving.) But now he's back, and so is, coincidentally, Clark Kent. After reunited with his Earth mom Martha (Eva Marie Saint), Clark returns to work at the Daily Planet, greeted enthusiastically by Jimmy Olson ( ) and less enthusiastically by Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who's really moved on. Seems Lois has fallen in love, gotten married, and given birth, all five years ago. Huh, how about that. Her hubby is now an assistant editor at the Planet and is conveniently the nephew of Perry White, played by the magnificent Frank Langella.",2007
1,"I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.",2006
7,"The basic premise of Superman Returns is that Superman has returned from an unexplained 5-year absence to find a world that seems to be getting along fine without him, that the woman he loves has moved on and has a family, and that he is- at least in terms of any beings similar to him- completely alone. The amazing thing is, this is the least angst-filled, least melodramatic superhero film in the past 5 years or so. I think the recent trend has been to try to get audiences to empathize with their heroes more by making them more human and actually taking them seriously. Peter Parker battles some very serious demons and is in constant struggle with being Spider-man, the X-Men films are very serious and political and the latest instalment, ""The Last Stand,"" featured some startling and emotionally wrenching revelations, and Batman, well, need I go on? ",2006
1,"OK, so my expectations were _really_ low to begin with. All I really wished for was a marginally decent story, at least mediocre acting, some not-so-bad acting from Kevin Spacey.

The film saw a surprise premiere after another in the festival was canceled. The visuals are like nothing I have ever seen before: spectacular, epic, ... words cannot describe this masterpiece of cinematography. Every scene is a work of art. The color palate is so rich, from the bright orange of desert mountains, to the vibrant red of a blood-soaked sheet, to the opulent green of the Indian's attire. The first five minutes of the film were arresting, the haunting soundtrack, the beautiful black and white images, I had goosebumps.",2008

Moreover, this film could be watched on mute and still make a lasting impression on the viewer through its striking imagery. The Fall is the story of Alexandria, an injured immigrant child wandering the hospital where she is being treated. The viewer is drawn, with Alexandria into a dark and extravagant world through the story of a maimed stuntman who she befriends. The skilled interaction between the finely divided reality and fantasy is reminiscent of David Cronenberg's eXistenZ. I can not recommend this film any more strongly.",2007
10,"It had seven days of delay - being promised to be released on December 27th, it got in theaters only by January 3rd. It wasn't that much of a delay, but it bothered. Anyway, I have just seen it and boy was I amazed. Imagine ""300""'s picture having one of the deepest plots that have ever been made and having the independence that even the most indiest indie film would have times ten. Imagine the stories that you made up and lived in under the blanket of your bed at night when your parents were asleep. Imagine that you still have an imagination of a child and an experience of a grown-up who had been struck by the truth that usually breaks people's dreams and illusions. This is ""The Fall"". Honestly, I have never seen anything like this before. Being all obsessed with movies and watching every single one that seems interesting, I have never ever seen such power and independence in a film. Independent films usually have their common indie feel - a crooky picture that shows protest to all the camera glamour that most of Hollywood films have, lack of dialogues filled with deep thoughtful pauses and this pretentiousness that screams ""this is a masterpiece protest to Hollywood!"". Hell no - ""The Fall"" has nothing of that at all. Having a breathtakingly gorgeous picture, it has smart dialogues and striking truth that is being told by a broken man to a little dreamful girl. This is not a protest - this is just a story one man named Tarsem had courage to tell. I may call it a genius piece of cinematography, a masterpiece and something like that, but loud words like these doesn't fit this experience that you will have to encounter by yourself. Believe me, you won't find the right words to describe the feel that you will have after watching this one.",2008

The casting was excellent, i thought the acting was very good, especially since all the actors/actresses are fairly unknown, especially the girl who plays Alexandria - an incredibly natural performance; this can probably be attributed to Tarsem's approach.",2007
8,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, in the pediatric wing of a hospital in Los Angeles, the talkative five year-old girl Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is recovering from a broken arm. Alexandria works with her family of immigrants in the harvest of oranges and she has just lost her father. When she meets the injured stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) recovering from a fall and also brokenhearted with the loss of his girlfriend to the lead actor, he begins to tell a fantastic tale about six heroes and their common enemy, the hideous Governor Odious. Black Bandit that lost his brother Blue Bandit that was killed by Odious' men; the expert in explosives Luigi that was outcast in his town by Odious; the Indian that lost his gorgeous wife that was abducted by Odious; the former slave Otta Benga that lost his twin brother in the fields of Odious; Charles Darwin that receives a rare ""Mistica Americana"" butterfly killed by Odious; and Mystic that hated Odious that destroyed the fauna and flora of his lands, join forces to defeat the evil Odious. While Alexandria fantasizes the story projecting the images of her acquaintances in the characters, the heartsick Roy uses her innocence to ask the girl to still morphine and medicines from the dispensary for him to commit suicide.

9,"I saw this film in the Toronto Film Festival and was somewhat surprised by how much I enjoyed it, and the extent to which I was engaged in the reality that it creates. Catinca Untaru's performance is heartwarming and completely captivating, a truly lovable child-star whose appeal is based upon her authenticity and talent as opposed to her ability to bat her eyelids or wrinkle her nose. Her relationship with Roy (Lee Pace) is touching to behold and more importantly, entirely believable. Of course, as expected with Tarsem Singh as a director the film is visually stunning, featuring Baraka-like eye candy, which in itself deserves rave reviews and as a subsidiary to the story creates something quite spectacular. The use of worldwide locations allowed Tarsem to share some truly beautiful images with the viewers, and teamed with Catinca's acting left the audience as putty in his hands, laughing and crying as he wished.",2007

I was very impressed with Catinca Untaru ""Alexandria"", I would love to see more of her, very talented not to mention Lee Pace, you can tell they worked very well together. I can not wait to see this movie again. I felt the ending was closure. Dan Gilroy - you need to write more often-I just can't say enough about this film. The cinematography ....is just awesome.

This is a film unlike any other and one that kept me thinking about it for days afterward. Director Tarsem Singh, as expected,delivers every scene as a work of beauty, and peppers the film throughout with visual surprises. But The Fall is about much more than eye candy. High adventure, spectacular vistas, love, betrayal, and two lead actors who develop a relationship that is actually moving in more than a superficial way. Think David Lean as filtered through Jean-Pierre Jeaunet. The Fall is simply Tarsem Singh's love letter to cinema.",2007

Much like The Wizard of Oz, we see the duality of characters from the real world standing in for the heroes in the story. Young Alexandria uses what she knows to encompass herself into the fairy tale as her new friend Roy weaves a yarn of intrigue, not to lift the child's spirits, but instead for his own selfish gains.",2008

I found the 5 year old little girl just adorable. She has just the cutest way of speaking English in her accent. It was a good change from the usual genre of movies that we see. So I recommend that you should watch it if you are in the mood for a different kind of a film with a light drama, comedy and a whole lot of imagination. Additionally, if you like to travel a lot and have been to the places shown in the movie, you'll enjoy it more.",2009
10,"I love this movie. |I watch this movie in March 2008. And for me this is the best movie in 2008 along with The |Dark Knight. Lee Pace so handsome and did a great job in this movie. He could expressed a miserable and desperate man wonderfully. And Catinca Untaru, all my attention right to her. I love this little girl, I love the way he talk and i love the way he look at |Lee Pace. I love this movie very very much.",2009
9,"I really didn't know what to expect with this film. The only review i read was on this very site. I only got a copy of 'The Fall' from one of my friends, he didn't even watch it so i had no info from him. I'm delighted i watched this without knowing what to expect, it added to the film's impact. I had no preconceptions, or bias views to take into it, which proved worthwhile. The film is set in a 1920's Los Angeles hospital. Our two protagonists are complete opposites; a crippled stuntman with a deteriorating mental state(Lee Pace) and a young girl with a flourishing, imaginative mind(Catinca Untaru). Obviously there isn't much to do in a 1920's hospital and so Roy(Lee Pace) begins to tell Alexandria(Catinca) a mystical, fantasy tale of five 'bandits' on a globe-trotting quest. The film contains some of the most amazing visual imagery i have seen. And for that alone i would have rated this movie highly. However, it also has a moving subplot to compliment the fantasy, one of a very adult nature. Its almost like a gritty Tolkien tale. I also must take a moment to praise the acting of the fantastic Catinca Untaru. It was one of the most believable performances i have seen from a child actor since Danny Lloyd played 'Danny Torrance' in 'The Shining'. I'm sure Lee Pace had no problems working with this child actor, Pace also gave an excellent performance. The two were cast perfectly. When the end credits rolled, i found myself feeling empty; but not because the film was poor, the complete opposite. An emptiness brought on by loss, i was missing the film already, it felt like a friend had left. I had laughed and cried throughout the film and was now distraught to have seen it end, and really, isn't that the best compliment you could pay to a movie?",2009
10,"A beautiful and amazing film. Like Jean Luc Godard's ""Alphaville"" which transformed 60's Paris into a dystopian sc-fi planet without the use of special effects, Tarsem's ""The Fall"" shoots in 18 different countries and transforms some of the most beautiful locations on earth into a surreal fantasia of orange deserts, blue cities, and underwater photography of elephants swimming in the open ocean. The story is deceptively simple tale of a stuntman named Roy, whose taken an emotional and physical fall, meeting a 5 year old Persian girl named Alexandria, who fell and broke her arm working the California Orange grooves,meeting in a hospital in 1920's Los Angeles. Alexandria has lost her father, Roy's lost his girl and is suicidal, and Roy begins telling an epic tale of revenge, staring characters based on hospital staff and historical characters. Five heroes an Italian explosives expert, an Indian Prince, an African self-freed slave, Charles Darwin as young British naturalist who speaks to animals, and a mysterious masked Zorroesque bandit who is at turns Alexandria's father and Roy himself, set out to kill their mutual enemy Governor Odious(The leading man from the film Roy was working on, who stole his girl and drove him to his stunt/suicide?) in the story Roy tells Alexandria, provided she fetch things for him. Like so many oneiric fantasies, this story is about innocence and Romanticism vs. the big bad world, in Don Quixote it was romanticism and fantasy vs reality and deception, ""Pans Labrnth"" romanticism against fascism, ""Brazil' romanticism against bureaucracy, and ""The Fall"" likewise is romanticism against despair. The film is as grand in it's themes as it is in it's visuals, touching on love, death, despair, story-telling, manipulation, the early days of film making, innocence, cross cultural relationships(when Roy says wigwams describing the Indian's back-story, Alexandria imagines Hindu Palaces.), and reconstructing your life after a trauma, picking up the pieces after the fall. I was glad I saw this in theaters on a big screen, one of the most vibrant and beautiful things I've ever seen anywhere and at anytime. If you've seen Tarsem's first film ""The Cell"", you've got an idea of this directors abilities to work with both visuals and performers(he mad J-Lo passable). Alxandria is played by one the best child actress I've seen in a very long time, a 5 year old who speaks like a 5 year old, which injects a good helping of humor into the story. Instant classic, If you get a chance, see it.",2008
9,"'The Fall' has an endless series of incredibly exotic and beautiful visuals and deserves to be seen just for that. Tarsem (Singh)'s use of oddly contrasting main characters and costumes recalls Alejandro Jodorovsky, and the m√©lange of seldom-seen people and places mimics the late-career cinematic working methods of Pier Paolo Pasolini. The trompe l'oeil landscapes-into-faces obviously evoke some of the paintings of Salvador Dali. The director previously made 'The Cell' (2000), a darker film with an equally intense focus on bizarre fantasy and a blurred interface between reality and the visions of the unconscious.",2008
8,"I just saw ""The Fall"" after hearing about it for some time and, while watching it, thought two things. 1) It brought to mind ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and 2) showed me that, while ""The Fall"" was far from a perfect movie, it points out everything that's wrong with ""Pan."" To misquote Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated that movie. That's what this review will be about and if you don't want to hear my comparisons of the two films with that slant, don't read any more.",2009

9,"I was walking home the other evening having just watched this at the theatre. Two guys were ahead of me on the street and had just seen it as well. Not intending to listen in on their conversation ... I did anyway, *LOL*. One asked his friend what he thought about the movie and the second took a moment to think about it. His answer? ""Twisted man, too twisted!"" Thoreau wrote in Walden that ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" In 'Little Children,' we see that quiet desperation played out to full effect by desperate housewives, ex-cons and damaged loners. A deep study of loneliness, 'Little Children' is morally ambiguous and doesn't judge. It uses humour, it uses dread, and it is a film that is at times quirky, intelligent and ultimately fascinating.",2006
9,"""You couldn't change the past,"" the narrator of Little Children tells us at the movie's close, ""but the future could be a different story."" The lives of the men and women who live in the very paragon of bland suburbia appear to be crunchy (and even somewhat unforgiving) on the outside, but inside they break, well, just like a little girl. A veritable sea of emotions, from love, despair, neglect, and hate churns below their pristine, everything-in-its-place veneers.",2007
10,"Out of all the ""Oscar Bait"" films I've seen this year, this film beats them all. Little Children is an unbelievable masterpiece about what it means to grow up. This idea is brilliantly portrayed through characters - while categorized as ""adults"" - have yet to outgrow certain adolescent stages.",2006
10,"Bedrooms still play an important part in Todd Field universe but this time there is an outing, intellectual and emotional, that overwhelms in the apparent patina of familiarity. ""Little Children"" sizzles with an uncomfortable sense of impending doom. Kate Winslet, through her later day Madame Bovary, gives us a character that is recognisable and never seen before at the same time. Powerfully honest to the point of self destruction and yet, her feelings seem so clear and pure, so innocent. Kate Winslet in a superlative performance, invites us to believe that a human being can inhabit that contradiction without seem absurd. Patrick Wilson's courage without brains or vice versa is an uncomfortable pleasure to watch. Jennifer Connelly has one of the most chilling domestic moments I've seen in a long time: a moment of realisation at a dinner table. Contradictions, perhaps, are at the centre of this wonderfully conceived universe, Weary of domestic bliss. compassion for a child molester. Jack Earle Haley's psycho is not played for sympathy - he is a horrible character. He and his mother, the great Phyllis Somerville - are a realistic version of a Hitchcockian coupling. Adult entertainment, yes entertainment too, of the first order.",2007

8,"In the suburbs, the boredom Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) lives a dull marriage without love with her selfish husband Richard Pierce (Gregg Edelman), who is successful in his career but with awful sexual habits. She spends the mornings with her daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) in the playground observing the behavior of the suburban mothers with their children. When Sarah sees the frisson caused by the handsome ""househusband"" Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) in the other women, she decides to talk to him. Brad tells her that he has failed twice in the Bar exams for lawyer and he is financially supported by his wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), who is a documentary filmmaker. He omits that Kathy is a woman that gives all her attention to their son Aaron (Ty Simpkins), refusing to have sex with him. Sarah feels trapped in her unhappy life and has an affair with Brad, who is the opposite of Richard, in the afternoons. Meanwhile, the pervert Ronnie J.

10,"Just remarkable, because it goes in split second from laughter to deep tragic shock without affecting the credibility of the story, back and forth.",2006
7,"This movie does a wonderful job of representing the undertow of confusion and stuckness that threatens to pull people under. It cuts among interlocking stories that each center on someone who is about to dive down beneath their established life, and for entirely normal, believable reasons. 45 minutes into the film, all the main characters have thrown themselves into the vortex, creating the uneasy fear one feels for people who are about to risk everything they've deliberately built up in order to end a sense of suffocation that is much less concrete than the secure surface of their lives, but somehow more real. This is strong suspense film about that crucial question of whether or not our own happy lives actually make us feel alive.",2006
8,"Relationship drama is on the menu and Todd Field is the waiter, with expert skill and neat presentation. 'Little Children' zooms in on suburbia, navigating the world of desperate housewives and husbands. The dish proves a pleasant diversion, with crisp performances and a tasty centre.",2006
9,"Todd Field's Little Children's screenplay was written in collaboration with Tom Perrotta, on whose eponymous novel it's based. Perrotta wrote Election's, Bad Haircut's, and Joe College's funny, ironic screenplays before this. But though mildly satirical at times in its vision of middle-class white infidelity, this second film (at last) from the director of the powerful 2000 In the Bedroom, with its themes out of Cheever or Updike, also moves toward the solemn and the shocking.",2006
10,"The acclaimed director of ""In the Bedroom"" brings a brand new type of adulterous love tale. Todd Field co-adapts Tom Perrotta's novel and never leaves the source material unattended. The film is multi-layered with subtle undertones and illustrious questions wrapped into a parable of two people Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah Pierce, (Kate Winslet) individuals that feel so disenchanted with existence that they find ""comfort"" in one another. Brad is married to Kathy, (Jennifer Connelly) a beautiful Documentary film maker that pushes her husband to pass the Bar Exam that he's successfully failed twice. She sends him on nightly trips to the library to study where Brad often gets sidetracked into watching a couple of young skaters, skate around. Sarah is working on her dissertation and retires to the playground everyday with her daughter Lucy, to reminisce with the women of the neighborhood.

The incomprable Mr.Feild hid behind the curtain near the concession at the back of the Nugget Theater wringing his hands, looking a wee bit nauseous. It was all very endearing. The film is superb. Amongst the American fare it tops my list of films fromTelluride, next to the incomprable 'Day Night Day Night' directed by Julia Loktev. ",2006
4,"This is a movie about responsibility and being a grown-up that would make a 40 year old want to get a fake ID and set something on fire. It's too long, too transparent, thematically archaic and features the most superfluous narration in cinema history. There's clearly a lot of care and effort being put into this film. Unfortunately, it's all in the service of a plodding story that should have never made it to the big screen. It should have been taken out behind the barn and shot.",2011

9,"""Little Children"" is quite simply put, brilliant. It helps that the source material is top-notch but ""Little children"" has a cracker of a script! While Kate Winslet, as usual, turns in a fine performance as an embittered housewife it is Jackie Earl Haley who puts in a tour de force. He practically chews up the scenery when he's on screen. I can't remember where I've seen him before, but it was a long time ago. Kudos to whoever cast him in this role. The story is a simple one and one can imagine this making a good play as the locations are simple and few. While other films make a big show about ""cinematography"" and special effects, ""Little Children"" simply gets on with what's important. Storyline. Dialogue. Acting. I can't imagine why ""Little Children"" was overlooked at this years Oscar. In my opinion, it stands its own against ""The Departed"" et al. Update: Having seen the exalted ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with Supporting Actor Winner Alan Arkin, all I can say is, Jackie Earl Haley was robbed!!!! What a travesty of justice!!!",2007

7,"I watched this tonight in order to avoid a downpour of rain in New York City. I love Kate Winslet and she was fantastic in this film. I saw ""In the Bedroom"" and ""Little Children"" had a similar style but was much more riveting. I was warned by a writer friend of mine, that the pedophilia might turn me off to the film, but the issues raised were brilliantly-woven into the plot line, and I never shy away from watching films that portray potential realities.",2006
9,"As if Todd Field's In the Bedroom wasn't enough, he comes back with his next installment of twisted plots and even more twisted families. Todd Field Co-Adapts Tom Perrotas novel and does a terrific job. With an all-star cast, Little Children turns out to be the best picture I've seen all year since Half-Nelson. Kate Winslet plays Sarah; a stay at home mom taking care of her of her 4 year old daughter played by the adorable Sadie Goldstein. Every single story in this movie is different, yet each of them ferociously connects. Sarah is the UN-happy wife if Richard, played by Gregg Edelman. Richard alienates himself from his wife and kid. Instead of spending his free time playing with his daughter, he chooses to begin an obsession with an internet porn model. In return, Sarah is forced to spend every waking minute with her daughter. As in the opening scene shows, Sarah is at the park with her daughter. She shows no interest or acknowledgment of her daughter. Sarah has other problems that overpower her daughter. She is different from the other mothers at the park. They are all Tupperware and Cardigans and she is neither. Little did she know all that would change with the return of Brad, played by a terrific Patrick Wilson. Brad is also a stay at home dad whose wife Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly is a documentary maker who Brad insists wear's the ""pants"" in the house. There relationship is secretly taking a wrong turn due to Kathy's constant nagging at Brad to take his bar exam again. Brad has already failed this exam twice. So as a gesture to get Kathy off his back he leaves every night and says he's going to the library. But surprisingly he always gets sidetracked at the local park where he watches young teens skate.

2,"In the spirit of ""Grand Canyon"" and ""American Beauty,"" this is an overwrought epic about sex panic in America. While it's good to have conversations about sexuality, monogamy and the treatment of people convicted of sex crimes, the writing in this script is so wooden that the result is nearly unbearable. There's actually a voice-over narration with a cheesy male voice that begs the question ""Is this a satire?"" I kept waiting for the irony to break through, but it doesn't. It becomes clear that this is Hollywood congratulating itself for taking on large social issues, albeit only the concerns of suburban rich white people.",2007
7,"A release that I had looked forward to for almost a month after seeing the trailer in the theatre, it had finally hatched in October. Tom Perrotta's ""satirical"" 2004 novel had been released and I was able to finish reading it before the film's impending release. The film stars Kate Winslet (who, along with Guy Pearce, have both mastered the American accent in ennui), Academy Award-winning Jennifer Connelly (who unfortunately does not have enough screen time) and rising newcomer Patrick Wilson (destined to become the next Josh Lucas). The other comeback (and so many reviewers have mentioned him already) is the return of former teen heartthrob Jackie Earle Haley (""Breaking Away,"" ""The Bad News Bears"") as a parolee pedophile who is carefully insinuated in the film's climax. A redeeming endeavor on film involving such an un-redeeming character. ",2006
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Where the heck have you been, Todd Field? Last seen directing 2001's excellent ""In The Bedroom"", Field delivers another remarkable drama with ""Little Children"".

It's a teen movie (hate them), it's a sports movie (hate them), it's a formulaic troubled teen makes good with help of mentor movie (you get the idea). It came on cable one day and I ended up sticking with it-I'm glad I did. Instead of hating it, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. It's definitely formulaic, but so are 95% of the movies out there, anyway. They just pull off the formula very well. Gymnastics is something I have a great deal of respect for (unlike figure skaters, sorry), those people are hardcore athletes. The scenes involving the actual gymnastics, whether in competition or practice, are filmed quite creatively. The actors are cast well, also, especially the lead. She looks so...all-American, for lack of a better description, and can actually act. I'm not a teenager, BTW, so I would imagine teens would enjoy this even more.",2008

The opening of the movie is extremely creative, and you immediately get a feel for the type of teen bubbly movie it is. There are a few serious points, but all in all the main message of this movie is just because an adult says it, it doesn't make it right. Cheesiness is a given within this movie, as are tons of laughs, beautiful girls, attitude, and two gorgeous guys.

They make good on that promise and redeem themselves and yes everything is right with the world. OK I admit it, I like it every time I see it.

I find the story good, somewhat flat and one dimensional but nevertheless entertaining. I don't know what it is about bad acting but I really am fascinated with it. It forces you to look at the films with a humorous edge which these days is important. It came out last year and was on TV all this month. I had to watch it over and over again just because. Jeff Bridges is good and funny and gives the whole story a realistic flair. The thing that keeps you glued to the screen and keeps you from walking out are the dresses, the tight butts, and the pretty faces. I think it is really a sexy film more than anything else.

This movie is probably better suited for the younger crowd (9-13). However, the stunts were excellent. I was impressed by a lot of the flips and the reality of the typical gymnast's life.

It is much like the TV show Make it or Break it, which is also gymnastics. This movie however is better because it doesn't have all that extra unwanted drama that repeats itself and gets annoying.

Stiller, famous for being *in* funny situations and not making them, actually acted like a comic character, something of a cross between Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. Usuaully he's a passive element, but here he propelled the comedy further. Great job. Also, a fantastic group of supporting characters like Gus, Mr. McPhee and Atilla the Hun. The only problem I really had was the son, who was much too perfect and pacific to be of any interest, and was, at most times, quite annoying.",2006
8,Don't go into this movie expecting a complex plot and deep insight into the human condition. The story and plot are lightweight but that doesn't matter too much. The characters are likable enough and the situation is definitely full of possibilities. ,2006

8,"Slightly overlong - and lacking the perhaps obligatory love interest - this is as good a film as any parent will be able to excite their kids with this holiday period - well certainly in the UK. The film has huge plot holes and probably hundreds of continuity errors but rampaging dinosaurs, goodish CGI and another athletic comic turn from Ben Stiller, together with the gorgeous Carla Gugino make this near perfect Xmas cinematic fair.",2006

5,"In Night At the Museum, Ben Stiller plays his usual role as a good-hearted schlemiel thrust into a humiliating situation that he ultimately emerges from with a small measure of heroic dignity. In this instance, his character, Larry Daley, is an out of work weekend Dad who is about to be evicted from his apartment once again and thus lose the last shred of admiration his ten year old son has for him. To keep both the apartment and the son's affections, he accepts a job as night watchman at a New York City Natural History Museum, where an Egyptian tablet has for some decades administered a powerful magic spell that causes history literally to ""come alive."" ",2007
5,"In Night of the Museum, Ben Stiller plays Larry Daley, a divorced middle aged man who has gone through failure after failure, spending his life always attempting schemes to make it as something big, but never succeeding. After being freshly evicted, he finally settles for a fall-back job, for his 10-year old son. He ends up taking a job at a Museum of Natural History as a night guard, a seemingly safe and mellow position... seemingly. After receiving instructions from the trio of elderly workers who were employed previously to him, he begins his duty, at which point the surprise comes. The entire museum comes to life at night.",2006
10,"This movie was definitely a surprise with other actors making their appearance (i.e. Owen Wilson). Ben Stiller was hilarious and the movie overall was great along with the special effects. Definitely a great movie that made my family laugh and totally enjoy every moment of this movie. This was one of those surprise movies that had great special effects and some great surprises and twists and the movie was definitely moving a great speed, not boring at all. Robin Williams was great as President Teddy Roosevelt. For those who think this movie was not that great have no imagination because each one of my sons ranging in age 12 - 21 loved it and that speaks for itself. I would go watch it again.",2006

My worst fears initially appeared justified, as we were served a large helping of the Stiller charm-challenged schlub. When the museum chaos started early I steeled myself for another hour of nonstop slapstick mayhem and mugging.",2007
7,"All Hollywood movies have one thing in common. They have the special ability to make past eras of history, rich, poignant and interesting. That is the premise of this film, ""A Night at The Museum."" It is the simple story of a father, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) who has developed a strained relation with his son. The boy, like most children wishes his bond with his father was more secure. Instead, Larry dreams of becoming an over-night success with his wild 'get rich' schemes. In doing so he puts in jeopardy the custody of his son. To remedy this situation, Larry takes a job as a night-watchman at a museum. Unbeknownst to him, three aging guards, Cecil, Gus and Reginald (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs) do not inform him of their larcenous intentions, nor of the 'Special' magic which descends upon the place each night. Because of the three aging veterans of Hollywood and a well-placed Robin Williams, this movie is destined for Classic status. Due to the incredible artistry of special Effects, what the viewer sees is nothing short of wondrous. This is a fantastic movie. If pressed to find a flaw in the film, I'd say, I would have chosen someone like, Jim Carey or Michael Richards for the father/son scenes as Mr. Stiller was a bit artificial. Still, the movie is worth seeing as it is. ****",2007
8,"This is definitely one of those movies which you have low to moderate hopes for. You watch it for that slim chance that it might just be a hidden jem. I thought that this movie would be exceptionally poor in fact, I am very glad to say that I was very wrong. Night at the museum is suitable for all ages I am 15 myself and watched it with my father and younger brother and all of us agreed that it was well worth watching again. It's humour is funny and as clever as you can expect from a Ben Stiller movie. The story is compelling, the characters have some level of depth and Robin Williams steals the show. I think Night at the museum is quite under rated and is actually a very good movie. So to sum up it is a fun and involving movie to watch and is certainly something very unique. If you like Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller or Robin Williams movies, I would highly recommend this.",2007

It seemed a mixture of few films moulded into a new scenario.It for me had hints of Jumanji(animals, soldiers etc)without any dark shades or complex storyline and hints of Liar Liar - in terms of father trying to meet the expectation of his son by being around.",2006
1,"This is the kind of movie that is so bad that, instead of being engaged with what is happening on screen, your eyes sort of glaze over, and you ponder things like: How do expensive movies like this get made in the first place? Did the producers owe the writers a favor? Was this nepotism run amok? Were the writers really professionals, or did they hijack a third grade writing assignment? Are actors like Ben Stiller and Robin Williams doing so badly that they couldn't pass up on this script? Did I remember to take the trash out? How long did it take that dust to form on top of the TV?",2007

Now that I have managed to formulate an opinion, I can proceed with writing this review. That being said, my expectations for A Night at the Museum were hardly great. Indeed, my friend and I only saw it because we had, much to our chagrin, arrived too early to see the critically-acclaimed Borat or Casino Royale. We decided to see it because of the presence of the usually steady Ben Stiller. Despite his star billing, I expected A Night at the Museum to be standard family fare; not bad, just predictable and formulaic. My expectations were fulfilled. There were bad scenes, mostly involving Stiller and his son, which introduced overpowering, cringe-inducing sentiment. The plot is also uninspired, revolving around a stereotypical loser with a downtrodden son and marital difficulties. (wait on - is this a reprise of the appalling Jingle All The Way?) The saddest part is that my friend and I managed to telegraph key areas of the plot and also many of the various subplots. The rap music which was dubbed over the credits was also out of place with the rest of the movie. Not only can I see the presence of the rap music potentially turning off parents from seeing the movie, but the rap-c*** also left a bad taste in my mouth.",2007
10,"The plot outline listed for this movie... ""A bumbling security guard at the Museum of Natural History accidentally lets loose an ancient curse that causes the animals and insects on display to come to life and wreak havoc"" ...is not accurate.

10,"In terms of pure unadulterated cringe-worthiness, this film just about outshines them all. It is brilliant, horrific, hilarious, sad, outrageous, revealing, and incredibly clever. It shows up people's narrow-mindedness, their racism, their inability to accept or understand different cultures. It makes me scared for the future of the world, and delighted that someone actually sees most people for what they really are - blinkered and uneducated.",2007
10,"This movie is more deep than it appears to the general crowd expecting a laugh on a Sunday. Most people will go to watch it as a funny movie, but it is not a funny movie in that sense. It is a Satire about how people in many parts of the world still feel about homosexuality, equality of women, need for a woman's consent to a marriage, prostitution as a profession, racism, and so on. It also portrays how even some westerners feel about religion and Jesus. The scene may seriously bother you if you are too much into Jesus (It is supposed to bother you, if you really get it).",2007

7,"The laughter is genuine even when I was appalled at what I was laughing at. Is Sacha Baron Cohen a genius of sorts or the biggest smart ass to hit the screens in a long, very long time? He makes John Waters appear like an (old) Disney product. The nastiness works because it is immediately recognizable and his targets live next door if not with me between my four walls. It is a social-horror-documentary. The three guys talking about women between beer and beer was so horribly real that I wanted to leave the theater laughing and screaming at the same time. Borat is not tender about his own background either. He is an equal opportunity offender if I ever saw one. The world is a cesspool and nobody is immune. Even his innocence is corrupt. I've been considering seeing it again, as the whole thing in one single disgusting lump was too much to take but I'm not sure I want to. I'll wait for the DVD where I'll be able to select and discard. My only question is now, what will Sacha Baron Cohen do for an encore.",2007
7,"I must make these disclaimers--I may be one of a few people who have never seen Da Ali G, or known much more about Borat than a couple of TV trailers. But I do have a keen sense of taste for offensiveness as well as critical commentary. I can say that this film is great in terms of pure and blatant offensiveness. Fair game is made of all people, ""retards"", blacks, whites, Jews, evangelicals, Southerners...I know I'm forgetting a few others. But, frankly, this approach is nothing new, and is in many ways only a repeat or an extension of comic territory that Sarah Silverman has owned on the stand-up circuit. Admittedly, Cohen delivers well, with explosively offensive and entertaining work.",2006
1,"While even I have to admit there were moments where I laughed out loud at the idiocy of some of the people ""Borat"" meets in his cross-country journey, this movie was just too much. It goes too far, is too crass, and while the idea is beautifully crafted politically, it loses its focus. You will surely enjoy his portrayal of the idiotic American (everything from bigot hick to religious fanatic to drunken frat boy), but the ""glorious nation of Kazakhstan"" doesn't stop there. I could even put up with the defamation of our National Anthem and the constant barrage of sexual situations, but it goes even further than that! I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to movies, but I'm warning you now, Borat will have you leaving the theater in discomfort and confused as to where your 9 dollars went. The racist and sexist stuff I can take with a grain of salt, but it was the excessive (and pointless: the movie could have been terrific without it) nudity that finally pushed it over the top for me. Borat is just too much.",2006
9,"I, too, caught this early screening in Marina Del Rey. Thought the film was great... the ending could have had more kick to it and been a bit more drawn out, but I was laughing so hard throughout that I barely noticed. Unlike the other comments I read, the nude scenes and the naked wrestling repulsed me. But there were so many other scenes where I felt like I was going to pass out from the pure ridiculousness of it all. Again, Cohen cleverly draws out the ignorance of so many people from the ""U.S. and A."" and we're left shocked, humbled, more aware, and having stomach pains from the hilarity of how he does it. He again proves what people will do for the camera and how people's true colors shine when they meet someone with more radical beliefs than their own. I left the theater saying ""wow wow wee waaaaa""!!!",2006

At the time, several years ago, I was completing the ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance"" while also serving as a caregiver. What do you suppose Mr. Cohen was busy doing? Basically he was serving up his unique brand of cultural satire by walking fully suited, with cameraman in tow, into a shower room full of totally unclothed Savannah Gnats baseball team members. That particular footage wound up on Cohen's 'Da Ali G Show'ÔøΩ DVD, featuring his portrayal of the wanna-be Jamaican Londoner gangsta rapper: Ali G. Since I missed greeting Cohen when he visited my fair city (as well as Atlanta, Charleston, and other southern venues) writing a review of his outrageously iconoclastic movie, 'BORAT, Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,'ÔøΩ seems like a southerly hospitable thing to do to make up for it.",2008

For all of you who cry that America is better than portrayed - grow up and face the fact that ignorance and prejudice live everywhere.

The current chic of political correctness is almost more damaging than ignorance itself. Bigots and fools have been forced back into the closet - and people still do and feel the same awful things while they make sure that the use the politically correct terminology to cover their hypocrisy. Learn to laugh at yourself, and get a life. This movie is funny.",2007

Calling Jews cockroaches and monsters that lay eggs, and making fun of rape victims. Showing some naked obese guy humping Borat's face, and showing a close up of his sons dick, is taking it too far. This was a waste of film. If this had been rated higher it would have made more sense, but it was 14A, so little kids can see this. i know some people for whatever reason thought this was great, and will probably reply by telling me I'm taking it too seriously, but i think parents should be warned before they let their kids watch this.",2006

As a result, the two styles destructively interfere and you can't help but feel cheated. The script is just horrific. Uninteresting scenes get a lot of screen time, the level of depth is as mentioned before: shallower than the thinnest material known to mankind.

The whole movie relies far too heavily on alternating slow-motion sequences with fast-forwarding to illustrate the main characters insomnia, which, by the way, is thoroughly unconvincing.

The dialogue about the clock watching i could identify with but the overall message is grotty and ill conceived. In a world where beauty is seen mostly seen as only being skin deep, this film does nothing to dispel or encourage any other kind of thinking. The film thinks it's being clever but anything but. Its obvious and foul in the way it looks at how men view women as nothing more sex objects. This is the film equivalent of six builders having a tea break,wolf whistling and shouting like apes at any unfortunate young female passer by.

To my surprise, it was a feature length version of his brilliant short. I didn't know what to think, how could he hope to enhance what worked so well in 25 minutes? How could he risk ruining the beauty and magic of what he had? To my shock, he not only kept the stunning visual flair and emotive compositions, freezing beauty and time, he enhanced it completely. The film Cashback is a pure work of art to be viewed with a gallery mentality. This is not a movie to be taken lightly, but a piece of art to behold with wonder and thought.

Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech. Third, the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch. In reality it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise the movie was dead on, I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search & rescue instead of just Aviation based rates.

8,"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two actors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic, or a profound social commentary film. Rather, its a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work. Bravo!",2006
8,"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. The ""specific"" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and ""wowing""...I haven't seen such angry seas since ""The Perfect Storm"". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. The film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.",2006
8,"I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.",2006
9,I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.,2006
5,"I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death.",2007
7,"I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on screen is a pleasure. The two unaccredited stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie. The movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact. This movie earns the audience applause. And the applause of my two sons.",2006
6,"There's a point in 'The Guardian' where it reaches its logical conclusion and I expected the credits to roll and was mentally ready to leave, but they didn't and another section which could have ended the film followed, with another two after that. ",2006
7,"If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.",2006
4,"Wow, another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even that baseball movie. Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroics, the flaws, the greatness, the fall, the redemption. Yup, within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie, we're all supposed to be in awe of his character, and it builds up more and more from there.",2007
9,"Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed ""The Guardian"". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.",2006
7,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre-release last night and, though I wasn't expecting to, actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part. The rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments, probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living. The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste.",2006
5,"While not entirely a miss, THE GUARDIAN could have been better. Hats off to the Coast Guard, but the story line could have been better. This was a paint-by-numbers screen play. Not at all original, and much too many clich√©s'. Acting is OK, with no great shakes. But as written, not even the best actors could do much with the material, although better actors could probably save it a bit. Too much attention to the Kutcher and Kostner characters, while the others go by the wayside. Not good writing. What happened to the cute gal in the gang? You'll have to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD. The movie would have been much better if it had ended without the predictable resolution. Again, see the DVD for the more ""happier"" ending. However, both endings were terrible. And the final scene with Kutcher going to the classroom of his girlfriend was just too corny for words. The best things about the movie were the training scenes and the rescue sequences. Forget the rest. Boy oh boy, am I tired of the Special EFFECTS. They look just like that...EFFECTS, not real.",2007
7,"I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were/are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here. Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support.",2006
4,"Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Credible performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you will learn something about the script meetings. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn, you'll be able to pick them out. Despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this one should have washed out the very first day.",2007
5,"Variations of this have been done so many times in so many other movies, you will be predicting the story several scenes in advance. I could not help thinking of other movies while watching this one, and that can't be good. I mean, a movie is supposed to keep you enthralled with what is currently on the screen, right? During the film I was recalling movies like Top Gun and The Perfect Storm, just to name a couple.",2006
3,"This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialog is wooden, the situations hackneyed. It's too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting, I fear. The script is formulaic, but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.",2006
5,"With these kinda films, I'm always torn between two thoughts: I want to judge the film on it's own merits. But I also want to respect the men and woman (in uniform) the film portrays. It's like George W. Bush telling me to respect the men and women fighting terror: I don't agree with his policy, but the men and woman he sends abroad fighting terror deserve and do earn my respect. So my conclusion: the men and women of the Coast Guard deserve a film like this, but the movie-going public deserved a better film.",2007
6,"This movie ORIGINALLY HAD one of the most perfect endings I've seen come out of Hollywood in a LONG, LONG time... I mean it. It was perfect! The movie built and built to a tremendously satisfactory finish. The kind of finish that leaves you walking out of the theater with tears rolling down your cheeks yet with a big smile on your face and enlightenment in your soul.",2006
3,"I'm sick and tired of no talent and over-rated actors that receive quality roles and continue to believe their own hype. Ashton Kutcher is a horrible actor; granted, he had some pretty funny moments on That 70's Show, but in all actuality anybody can play an idiot. I know he is very attractive and that draws a huge female crowd, but he can't act to save his life. He is the poster-boy for exceptionally good-looking actors with no skill what-so-ever receiving exceptionally good roles. Any movie that he is in is going to be all about a studio receiving large sums of money; it is not going to be about great acting and making the film in question the best picture live up to it's full potential. This problem is plague to the movie industry and hopefully people will eventually start to look beyond pure good looks and begin to observe talent and skill. Another problem with this movie is that is full of military movie clich√©s; I liked it better when it was called An Officer and a Gentleman. This studio should be ashamed and Ashton should quit stealing good roles from quality actors.",2006
3,"My friend and I really did want to see The Guardian when it was released in the theater, but we never got the chance or had the money when we had the opportunity. I just rented it and we watched it together last night and I fell asleep 3 times! I thought maybe it was just me, but even my friend said that she thought it was a little dull. Then we asked our other friend what he thought and he just sighed and said that he was with me on the sleeping. The story was just so dull and predictable, Ashton and Kevin, I'm so sorry to say this, but they're not strong enough leading men to keep a story moving.",2007
10,"I was, in the beginning, very hesitant to go see this movie. Both of my parents had been in the coast guard. My father died and my mother is still alive. I didn't want it to bring back the memories of losing my father, but I went anyways.",2006
6,"Anyone who expected this movie to be an amazing, intelligent film will be severely disappointed. However, from the trailer, I made a guess as to the general quality of the film. I was right, and I enjoyed myself.",2006
4,"Basic summary: Ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped the Salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy. The first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers.",2006
7,"The idea of the movie was better than the movie itself, I thought. It did have potential, but didn't really embrace it as much as it should have. Basically, it's about four warlocks who are descent from four families from the 17th century who were able to harness the power of witchcraft. But when a fifth one shows up, stronger than all of them and seeking the power of the others, they must stop him before he kills them and everyone they care about. Think Underworld meets Highlander, and that's the basic mood of the movie. It's easy to think of this as an Underworld knock off, but it was actually better than that. The plot is predictable, and drags at times, and there is almost no character development. A lot of interesting subplots are touched upon, but never really explored, and the way they ended it, they obviously want sequels. Check it out, there's some pretty cool action scenes and an interesting story to back it up, but don't count on being blown away.",2006
5,"I must admit this wasn't as bad as I expected. I've seen several Renny Harlin movies, none of which I've liked (in fact, I hated them). So, going into this one, I had little hope (if any). The story isn't the most originial thing I've ever heard of, but it's not a carbon copy of anything else. The story development is pretty straight-forward and predictable. The graphics are what you'd expect, as well. My main complaint with this film is what I call gratuitous dialogue: when people talk too much or think outloud to fill the audience in on what they're thinking. There's a lot of ""ha ha I'm so evil"" talk from the villain, as well. But, hey, if you can't have fun at the movies, why bother going? All in all, worth seeing at least once.",2006
5,This movie is essentially for teenagers. The cool boys in the school meet the cool girls. The boys have supernatural powers and it's all about being in control and appealing to the opposite sex. The plot itself is fairly shallow and offers no twists or turns.,2006
5,"After seeing the previews for this, I went in expecting to see something like a slightly cheesier version of ""The Craft,"" but with boys, and I wasn't disappointed. At the most basic level, the premise is similar: four teenagers at a private school dabbling in supernatural power/magic. However, while ""The Craft"" is by no means a brilliant film, the writing and acting are both substantially better than what's seen in ""The Covenant."" ",2006
9,"Okay, so it's a male version of the Craft...kinda. Yes, I'd have to agree with that summation; however, this features MUCH more story, more meat, more history, and a FAR better execution than the Craft. It also presents a much better developed story, characters, and production style.",2007
7,"Going into seeing ""The Covenant,"" I had little expectations. I had expected this to be a big budget movie, full of action sequences and nothing else. Some parts of me believed it would be terrible, but other parts of me had hope because ""Underworld,"" the producers of ""The Covenant,"" was great. Honestly, I can say that I enjoyed it. There were flaws, but not enough for me to walk out or demand my money back.",2006

However, the use of magic addicts and if used in excess, ages the warlock. In the present days, four wizards teenage friends are in high school and their leader Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) is close to his eighteenth birthday and consequently to ascend. He has just met Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) and they are dating, when the appearance of darkling and supernatural dreams haunt the group. Sooner they find an evil warlock, descendant of the fifth ancient family that wants to strip Caleb's power.",2007
1,"It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And, yeah, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it. It is really stunningly bad, to the extent where it can actually be funny. I would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it. They were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the (really clich√©) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end. Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film. I don't think mainstream, Hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone) so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teen who likes The Pussycat Dolls, thinks Paris Hilton is ""hot"" and watches MTV it's like some sort of wasteland. Life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. :( P.S. Someone should have told the Director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members ""totally HAWT LOL!!!111!!""",2007
1,"When I saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 I assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100. This is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term. Poorly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but able to grimace when ordered to. For the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction, then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers, the ""writer"" cheats. It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story-line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement. Not that the write would even know the word ""denouement."" Some movies go directly to DVD. This one should have gone directly to the dustbin.",2007
1,"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that. The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. They could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes, however someone decided,(maybe the director, but I don't know if anyone really ""directed"" this movie) that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed ""artsy"" camera shots, and nonsensical scenes of the ""boys"" swimming and getting into bar fights. About half way through this film I thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining, and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling I had for continuing to watch it. . So I did bash my head against a wall, and I did enjoy it more then the movie! I watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment. Nope,my efforts were rewarded with ""How about I make you my Whee-aytch!"" I vomited, and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel. The acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work, and work it did, on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and this actually wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen. After it was over I did feel like watching the movie ""Stealth"" again and WOW it was so much better this time around! Oh yeah Case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. Watch a few episodes of ""Charmed"", and watch ""The Lost boys"" after having a fair amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. If you do fall into the same trap that I did and watch ""The Covenant"", make sure to keep all sharp objects far, far away from yourself, you'll thank me for it.",2007
6,"The Covenant just goes to show that every once in a while you should take a chance on a movie you know almost nothing about. While it's isn't Shakespeare, it is a fairly well-done horror movie that doesn't rely on gore or shlock to work its 'magic.' The story follows four boys who are descended from families from the colony of Ipswich, Mass; they are the eldest son of the eldest son blah blah blah and they have inherited dark magical powers from their ancestors (who apparently were the only survivors of the Salem witch trials). The movie comes right out at the start and pretty much tells you just to accept the powers, that they aren't going to be explained, but you know, I'd rather have that than finding out it's all just a bunch of benevolent bacteria or something equally inane. Anyway, the boys are: the serious, responsible one, Caleb (Steven Strait), his slightly edgy best friend Pogue (Taylor Kitsch, looking for all the world like 7th Heaven's Barry Watson, even down to the hair), the guy who shows off with his powers, Reid (Toby Hemmingway), and a fourth guy who is sketched so briefly and says so little he's barely there at all.",2006
1,"Wow! I just don't even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful. Maybe I should start by just saying that during a ""heated confrontation"" between the antagonist and protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so hard. Yeah. The acting really was that bad. The acting was not even the worst part though. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The characters are all grossly underdeveloped. The dialogue and ""dramatic moments"" are ridiculous. The bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, power drunk, sadist.",2006
1,"I am not even sure where to begin... so I will start with this... In 15 years of going to the movies that I have paid for with my own money there has been only one I walked out of; this is now the second. This film does not start anywhere, does not go anywhere, is not suspenseful, is not scary, elicits neither sympathy or empathy for the protagonists nor disdain for the antagonist and has some of the most poorly written dialogue in film to date. This film suffers from the script supervisor (responsible for continuity) being asleep in a lot of the scenes making the flow of the film abysmal. This film has randomly placed scenes which try to tie motivations between characters and events through out the film when very little foundation has been laid for anything that happens; everything seems forced and artificial.

The special effects are crappy, the ""actors"" are dreadful, and the ending is a pathetic setup for a sequel that, if the box office is any indication, will not be happening. Also, what's up with all the homo eroticism in this flick? From the guys walking around sweaty and shirtless, to the villain KISSING the hero completely out of the blue, this movie just sucks.

It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone who¬ólike all of us¬óis now fourteen years older, and¬óunlike most of us¬óstill looks wonderful. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.",2006

8,"So, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie... There is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (Battlefield Earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! I mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. So yeaaah, maybe those movies aren't perfect, but c'mon, how many movies are? Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings! Not everybody will enjoy these movies, but I bet there are more than who admit they do. Hudson Hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, Color of Night (1994), which may not be Oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, Swept Away (2002), which I thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, Gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former ""Bennifer""-Couple, and this year it's ""Basic Instinct 2""! Well, when I heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies I was very sceptically, and although I really love Sharon Stone I stayed sceptically until I've finally seen this movie. And really, I was very positively surprised! I can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. It never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning Sharon Stone reprising the role of her life! With 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but it's more than her being beautiful, it's brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. It's simply a pleasure to watch her as Catherine Tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! So I really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! Maybe the story isn't Oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! It's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! So give it a try!",2006
8,"I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy.

Let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.",2006
7,"I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, perhaps someone very young ? I left the cinema feeling glad that I had not been swayed by the IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I am still trying to find flaws in the plot but I cannot think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind.",2006
6,"Yes,this movie is not as good as the original.That's that out of the way.It is,however,not so turgid as most reviews would have you think.There is an underlying intelligence to the whole movie,and although it is quite different to the first one in terms of mood and mystery,after all,we didn't know Catherine Tremayne then,it is a fairly decent attempt to attempt a what if,what if Catherine hadn't been caught out,what if she had succeeded in getting to England to carry on in her evil ways.The movie is good to look at,as was the first one,there are several confused characters,as in the first one,and there are more murders,although it's never really made clear as to who does what.In tone it reminded me of the ITV Monday,Tuesday night thrillers but I guess that's because it's set in London.Yes,there are some fairly amusing sexual encounters along the way,but they are there to give some emotional coherence to the characters involved.Stone still looks good,although her hairstyle is unflattering,and she seems to play it as though she's an ageing Barbie doll doing her best to get rid of all the sexual heat she's built up.The other actors are fair to good,and it was a good idea of the writers to add the scene at the end which is meant to screw our minds just as much as the poor Psychologist who's been caught up in all this.If you liked the first one,then give this a go.See it with an open mind.The first half is slow and a bit dull,the second half is much better.Six out of 10.",2006
9,"Finally, after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of ""Basic Instinct"", we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master Jerry Goldsmith), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake, ""Basic Instinct"" was a real winner for audiences everywhere. I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. Five years later, we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. When it was declared a dropped project, time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. Well, I guess we now know anything's possible in this case. Even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable Sharon Stone, and we have a done deal! Please, hear me out...",2006
8,"I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film. That goes for critics as well. Sure, if it gets positive reviews that's OK and a plus, but most films that get critical rave I hate. I enjoyed this film for what it was, an entertaining film. It takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character...that being Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is awesome in this role, just like she was in the first one. Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are great, much like in the first one. Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, ""If you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!"" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. I was captivated by her. Her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, its worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be. And yes, there are lots of twists, as in the first one, including the ending!",2006
1,"It's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones, who's flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clich√©-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project, it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making, it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.",2006
4,"There's really no way to pull off a sequel to the original classic, Basic Instinct. To do so would require much more than Sharon Stone who sizzles no matter what she is doing. She a fine actress, but surrounding her with unfamiliar actors in London, and handling a script that lacks everything witty and tight that Joe Eszterhas weaved in the original picture, is just disastrous.",2015
1,"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like ""I want to *beep* you "" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: ""Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?"" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. It's a pity that they made this film.",2006
5,"It has been over a decade since the original Basic Instinct was released and more resources have came along that provide easy access to information. Have these very resources caused more harm than people realize? Have people become stuck up and over-opinionated for their own good? In the recent years it seems to be pointed in that direction, some people are dependent on popular belief and with these new resources it can sometimes cause a negative reaction. More on this later, right now let's move onto the review.",2006
2,"It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact, dark thriller that achieved ""cult"" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film adds nothing, delivers nothing, and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.",2006
9,"It's the sequel that everybody (including me!) wanted to hate. The truth, is that there is actually damn all wrong with the movie. I expected an absolute disaster, and got something which is easily one of the most exciting films I have seen in a long time.",2006
8,"I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. You won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It has layers within layers, nuanced acting by Stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48,and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Give it a shot, you might be glad you did!",2006

10,"I am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is, I endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it. I had fun watching this movie, perhaps because Cat is everything I wish I could be, I am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing, the way she manipulates people it's just so divine. this is a very underrated movie, I lack of arguments here, I usually go enjoy and then speak little about it, when you go to the movies is to have fun, and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away. let's try not be so critical about it. thank you for reading.",2006
5,"Yes, it's true. This film is a bit of a turkey but it does have its moments. For instance, one of my favourite scenes takes place during Catherine's last treatment with Dr. Glass. Straddling an armless black leather chair with her legs spread out on either side, she confronts Dr. Glass with a seductive sexual purr about his fantasies of wanting to sleep with her. She goes into explicit detail about how he'd like to ravage her all the while we hear the squeaking of the leather fabric on the chair that she's straddling. It was a great moment. Probably the best in the entire movie. The audience literally burst out laughing when Catherine suddenly breaks her predatory purr and gets up from the chair then walks out of the office.",2006
8,"Sharon Stone is super hot. She has 50 and I would still give it to her for the championship. She doesn't perform memorable scenes like the opening of the legs, but the sex scenes are truly amazing for those who like to see action and appealing women. ¬øDavid Morrisey? Puhlease. He needs a serious acting coach. The storyline is, still again, random and lost. I liked the settings and how the dark corners are entraped in this film. The script, you ask? Worse than the adapation of ""Narnia"". No intelligent lines. I ask, why did they do this? The answer: to see Sharon Stone again, in her best moment. If you are a man; you should definitely spend 7.5 dollars to see this woman.",2006

Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us!

10,"I just saw Basic Instinct 2 again, and my opinion of the movie changed. Initially, I had a lot of issues with the movie. And then I read all of the negative press and reviews, and coupled with the awful box office, I really went in a second time with a much dimmer impression. But oddly, I very much came to love this sequel. I went back to see it looking through the lens that was created by all of the negative and vicious criticism. I went out of my way to pay attention to why people were saying this was one of the worst movies and/or sequels of all times, and I was very happy to realize that are all dead wrong. (Warning: some of this may contain slight spoilers) ",2006
10,"I saw Basic Instinct 2 in German last Friday because a friend wanted to see it. Normally I wouldn't be bothered with this kind of movie and can't remember ever seeing the whole of Basic Instinct 1. Anyway I found the new one very entertaining and went to see it again in English yesterday, Sunday, partly too because the plot needed a bit of checking out. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. It's a film with very strong visual images that really stay with you. The acting is first rate, Sharon Stone is in my opinion just divine to look at, and the development of the plot is slow enough for the characters to take on real flesh but without losing tension. The plot in itself is incredibly unlikely but who cares? The scene where Dr. Glass screws the waitress was missing in the English version, and possibly a few other short scenes too.",2006

9,"That last reviewer is nuts. I wasn't even in the mood to see this kind of a film, but I really got into it and enjoyed myself! Yes, there is a lot of cussing, but the movie is rated R, so it's lot as though it came as a surprise. These characters are freaking drug dealing gang members, for crying out loud--what else would one expect? The acting was excellent, with Justin Timberlake surprising me the most. I didn't think I'd be able to take him seriously, but his performance really was the standout of the film. The characters, for the most part, aren't likable, but very realistic and well-played.",2007
8,"Having learned about the ""Jesse James Hollywood"" case during my junior year in high school, I'll admit that I was actually extremely disappointed to find out that a film was being made depicting the events that had happened. However, I can now say, I think differently.",2007
7,"Although many of the actual names and locations have been changed for the movie, Nick Cassavetes' ""Alpha Dog"" tells the largely fact-based story of a particularly heinous homicide that took place in Southern California in the summer of 2000 (changed to the fall of 1999 for the film). The crime involved a group of young drug dealers who kidnapped, then eventually murdered, the 15-year-old brother of a fellow drug dealer who owed the ringleader money and who, largely out of stubbornness and pride, refused to pay up the debt. After the discovery of the body, most of the perpetrators were convicted and sent to prison, but the mastermind, Jesse James Hollywood (called Johnny Truelove in the movie), managed to flee to South America where, in 2005, he was eventually arrested and sent back to the States to face trial on the charge of murder-in-the-first-degree.",2007
8,"Alpha Dog starts off as what seems like a movie all about a group of friends who life their idea of the American dream: doing drugs, having sex, and hanging out with each other not a care in the world. However, when their leader, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), decides to kidnap the brother (Anton Yelchin) of a man (Ben Foster) who owes him drug money, their perfect world begins to shatter as they realize that their mindless prank has become a situation that could get them stuck in jail for the rest of their lives.",2007
8,"When I saw the rating of this movie on IMDb.com, I couldn't believe my eyes. This movie definitely deserves a much better rating (around 7 would be the appropriate rating). This is a story about spoiled, misguided teenagers who do nothing but smoke pot, drink and party. Understandably, all of the teenager characters act in accordance with this care-free life style. So, you should expect this sort of behavior from them (a lot of cursing, violence, sex, drug usage, etc.). I think the director did a terrific job of portraying the setting for this type of life style.",2007
8,"I watched the movie in a sneak preview. I didn't really know what I was in for. But I got pleasantly surprised ... I mean Justin Timberlake as an actor? I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who had/has prejudices about that. But he was really good. I saw Edison too, but he had Morgan Freeman and others by his side. I still can't say for sure if he acted in this one or if it's just an expansion of his personality (only time will tell . which means more movies with him), but I do think that he is good. Not De Niro/Pacino good, but good! :o) He is the first recognizable name of the young actors of course. You can't obviously forget about Sharon Stone (she's BTW in the one scene I don't like at all, because the scene is to long and it looks like Sharon made the director/editor lengthen that scene, just to show off ... her acting skills) and Bruce Willis. But besides them you also have Ben Foster, who some might know form his TV Work, others from his great job in the movie Hostage, but most will recognise as that Angel in X-Men 3! I could name the other young actors too, whom did all a great job in this movie, but you can also read their names on the IMDb list for the movie.",2007
7,"ALPHA DOG is a film that will resonate with the younger generation as its theme of drugs, rap music and sex can be translated through out the world where a group of teens are angry, ignored and violent. Whether it is the San Fernando valley or the Silicon valley, young men and women with time and money to spend on drink, drugs and sex will find the film is very familiar to their life styles. Sad, but true.",2007
8,"Alpha Dog tells an impulsive, thoughtless act. Based on the true story of the Jesse James Hollywood story, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) and his cronies don't know what to do with their new charge: one moment they stuff him in the closet and duct tape his mouth, and the next, he and Truelove's de facto second-in-command Frankie (Justin Timberlake) are playing X-Box. Zack is unfazed ‚Äî on one level, he's enjoying the adventure (in what must ultimately be Alpha Dog's saddest moment, he asserts that he sees it as ""just another story to tell his grandkids"") ",2014
8,I was not expecting to like this movie and I was not sure how JT would be as an actor but the film was very enjoyable and JT was great! The story is basically about a bunch of drug dealers trying to get back at another drug dealer in an escalating war of actions culminating in the main characters kidnapping the other drug dealers' half brother.,2013
10,"Alpha Dog is inspired by actual events and is about a drug dealer named Johnny Truelove who is owed money by an acquaintance of his named Jake. Seeing as Jake is not paying up, Johnny and his gang of friends decide to kidnap Jake's younger brother Zack and hold him until Jake pays. At first Zack is getting along really well with the people who kidnapped him and basically they just party and have fun all the time and Zack is not concerned at all. When Zack's parents and Jake become suspicious of who abducted him Johnny makes a plan with his friends as to what to do and things take a turn for the worst. Alpha Dog has good direction, a good script and good performances by the entire cast. After I left Alpha Dog, I realized just how impressed I was with it. Director and writer Nick Cassavetes does a great job of writing these teenage characters and just showing how they live their day to day lives. There is a certain authentic touch he gives these characters that makes the film all the more real and believable. The performances he gets out of these actors is also really impressive because everyone in this film shines. Near the end of the film the suspense builds up and the tension is delivered well and after the movie I could really feel the power of this film and it really made an impact on me. This is a type of film that left an impact on me that only truly great and powerfully made and delivered films will do. A lot of the film is just these teenage characters hanging out, partying and getting into trouble, but because it felt so real and genuine it was fascinating to watch. The scenes leading up to the powerful conclusion are also well written and I liked how the film looked at times like a documentary and at other times like a regular docudrama. The seediness and gritty nature of these characters and how they live and interact with each other is really showcased very well here and I don't think a film about teenagers and their lives has had such an impact on me since Larry Clark's Kids and Bully. This film is very similar to those films in a lot of ways and at times even borrows in their technique. However seeing as how I loved Kids and Bully this wasn't a problem for me at all and it just added to my love and admiration for this film. For a truly powerful and captivating motion picture that is a genuine and realistic slice of life which really had an impact on me I highly recommend this film. This is also the first film I have seen of 2007 and if there are more films with this kind of style, power and energy this year then 2007 will be a great year for movies.",2007
6,"Maybe I just had to wait too long for this one to finally come out. I have never been a Justin Timberlake fan, but he was one of the best things about this movie. You cannot dislike him in this. He does a good job of showing us the moral dilemma he is twisting in. I always love Emile Hirsch but found this character a little one dimensional. Gone were the moments where you can see everything he thinks and feels on his face as when he portrays Z-boy Jay Adams or as Tim Travis in ""Imaginary Heroes."" He is supposed to be the heartless bad guy in this and since he is portraying a real person perhaps the flatness of this character is due to an accurate depiction of real life Jesse James Hollywood. What this character lacks in emotion, others, such as ""Susan"" and ""Keith,"" give us a bit more to watch. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone are believable most of the time, but some moments feel incongruent (Stones final scene for example was over the top and in such a bad way). Likewise Ben Foster's Jake Mazursky is all over the place as a strung out-stressed out loser that starts the whole mess. He has moments of brilliance but otherwise he's just too much. The movie is way too long and tries to focus on every player in this truly tragic story. I would have liked more of Anton Yelchin's Zach and more of the emotional battles of the key characters and far less of the get high and blast out violent rap while insulting our sex partners in front of the whole gang. The story itself is captivating, but the movie tries too hard to do too much and gets in its own way. Yet I don't feel cheated out of the ticket price.",2007
8,"Taking place in southern California, 'Alpha Dog' is based on the 1999 kidnapping and murder of Nicholas Markowitz (here named Zack Mazursky). Not only does director Nick Cassavetes focus on the obvious ripped from the headlines story, he also zooms in and sheds light on another aspect. That of which being not all gangsters, or wannabe gangsters in this case, are masterminds. Sometimes, the alpha dog is actually the least intelligent member of the pack.",2007

Someone said, ""The film was amazing, heart wrenching towards the end, and very very well done,"" I agree with that 100%. Especially the heart wrenching description. I'll say this right now. Nothing, NOTHING prepares you for the climax of the film. And what's absolutely amazing is that, being based on a true story, we already know going in how it ends. Can you imagine what an amazing feat of film-making that is? To make a movie, where many KNOW the ending going in, and yet walk away feeling so emotionally devastated and drained that it's hard to talk about afterward?",2006

That's not a nice thing for a parent to watch, that's not a nice thing for anyone to watch actually, but the thing is the characters are my age.

1,"I saw this film at Sundance and was so disappointed with the direction and writing, I can't express it enough! The trailer made to promote Alpha Dog is amazing- please don't let it fool you. My first problem was that it had too much detail revealed in the dialogue, subtitles (which were never necessary to the plot), and too many characters to keep up with- making the film so long. I highly doubt the theatrical release will have the same time frame as it did in Park City. Mr. Cassevetes was trying to shock and touch an audience at the same time,which doesn't work in my opinion. All the characters in the story cuss like gangsters, leaving little room for characters' individuality. Especially when Anton Yelchin's character is supposed to be a juxtapose of the corrupt druggies that surround him. He looks different but talks exactly like them. His parents speak like this as well. Another writing problem is the lack of depth that is explored here- there are too many party scenes and not enough character developing ones. Justin Timberlake's character is the only one that slightly develops. The acting is directed to be too over-the-top, and comes across as very unbelievable. All the actors freak out continuously throughout the film for various reasons, screaming their lungs out like children. It becomes aggravating. In fact, at the screening I was in, the audience would laugh at parts like this because it seemed way too ridiculous. I won't give it away for those who care, but know that whether some plot elements are based on fact or creativity, there are many areas which are unbelievable and overemphasized. There is however some entertainment value to it I'll give the film that-the relationship between Anton and Justin's roles is very special, but overall, Alpha Dog did not belong at the Sundance Film Festival. It was very out-of-place there, and you'd know what I mean if you've ever seen a Sundance film, or have been to the festival before. Please don't give in to the hype that is about to come....",2006

His life is so stressful trying to run an expanding business, 3 households, appeasing 3 wives, hiding the fact that he is a polygamist from his neighbors and employees, dealing with the constant stress brought on by a man called the ""prophet"" who runs the polygamist compound Bill grew up in (his parents still live on this compound)who is trying to extort money out of his business and recently blocked it's expansion,and dealing with the stress that his brother and parents cause(i.e.his father played by Bruce Dern is a complete jerk and loves to pee in Bill's kitchen sink and his mother allegedly poisoned his father). I also love that he has a favorite wife,his 1st and only legal wife played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, because I love her character (she tries hard to be a good wife, mother, and support to the other wives) and the jealousy that the other wives feel make it that much more dramatic. His conniving 2nd wife played by Chloe Sevigny is so much fun to hate, not to mention she is the prophet's daughter and is loyal to him. And Gennifer Goodwin as his young 3rd wife is so cute and lovable. Though this show is chocked full of jealousy and emotion,you really get the sense that this family of 3 wives, 1 husband, and 7 children (with another 1 on the way)really do love each other. They're just having a hard time dealing with the stress that arises from this very unique lifestyle. Each week I wonder if the prophet is going to win his battle with Bill, if one of the wives are going to say forget it and leave, if this family is going to be exposed for what they are (a few characters have gotten close to discovering their secret), or if Bill is going to have a nervous break down. This show is jam packed with good actors and good acting with such interesting plots that you don't get caught up in feeling conflicted over liking this show because you think polygamy is wrong. You get caught up in the chaos that is this family's life and it is so much fun to watch. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",2006
10,"I cannot honestly remember when I enjoyed a television show quite so much. There are so many well developed characters in this show, yet there is still so much we do not know about them. We get a few hints each episode. I love the complex relationships these intriguing characters are involved in. The plot is intricate and moves at a fast pace without sacrificing believability. ",2006
9,"I was curious about this series because I like Paxton, Sevigny and Tina Majorino in particular, and also Harry Dean Stanton (whom I got to see play blues at the Mint, in L.A., a couple of years ago - got his autograph that night as well, which was very cool). I don't agree with 'the principle', but I do like the series.",2006
10,"When I first saw the ads for this show I said, ""huh. Really weird premise to base a show on. Not to mention towing the line on being patently offensive. How good can it possibly be?"" Well not only is it good, it's beyond wonderful. This is a series of many layers. It is at different turns screamingly hilarious, poignant to the point of tears and thought-provoking. Most of all though, it is just... human.",2006
7,"""The Sopranos"", ""Six feet under"", and now ""Big Love"". Hbo offers us a totally new outlook of family, this time by describing the harsh quotidian of a successful polygamist. The family according to Hbo is always subject of greater afflictions than the regular family. In ""The sopranos"", the father's profession was the issue (the mafia), in ""Six feet under"", the father's profession was once again the issue (death itself), and in ""Big love"", the father chose to live against the rules of society, he chose to be a polygamist and that's a big problem because it takes a lots of responsibilities to have three houses, three wives and plenty of children. Somehow, in all these TV series, everything rotates around the problematic of being a father and in a larger sense HBO talks to us about MORALITY. The way of life of these men is really the main idea. ""Big Love"" is a really great and profound show. As always, HBO prefers the realistic treatment of his subject rather than the inner and comical sense of polygamy. The cast is unbelievable, and the score is great. In spite of the dramatic aspect of this show, I find it really entertaining. Anyway, if you like HBO's shows, you will love ""Big Love"".",2006
10,"I find myself rushing to put the kids to bed on Sunday nights so that I can watch all of Big Love without interruption. I love how some of the characters struggle with being a polygamist and come to terms in their own way. Also, Nicki's character is one of those you love to hate. She drives me crazy most weeks with her behavior and then makes me really respect her in others. My experience in life is that most people are this way, where they do really dumb or selfish things majority of the times and then they surprise you with something wonderful, which is why you keep them in your life. Although the main theme of polygamy is not something I deal with in my life a lot of the other issues they face are things that can happen to any of us.",2006
9,"Yes, it has a nice complexity of characters, who are ever being revealed to us. Yes, you really don't need to know much about the Mormons to get this show. But what I really love is how it points out how very few people in our supposedly ""free society"" are truly free to be who they are without fear of judgment, or worse, legal hassles and entanglements. Little by little, our freedoms have been whittled down by those among us who think they know best for ALL of us. If you don't believe me, go find a cancer patient who wants to smoke pot for their nausea and pain. Go ask the Californian who adores their pet ferrets but must hide them from the dept of fish and game. Ask the person who exclusively prefers the company of someone of their own sex yet fears losing their job if the wrong people find out.",2007
8,"""Big Love"" begins as a gripping exploration of a family that attempts to walk the tightrope between polygamy and normalcy. Bill Paxton stars as Bill Henrickson, a straitlaced family man with three wives: Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Marge (Ginnifer Goodwin), and Nicolette (Chloe Sevigny).",2010
8,"This is such an amazing show. It has all the elements that make it as fantastic as it is - comedy, intrigue, action, sex - everything coming together in a delightful mix. The characters all have such depth, each with their own problems despite the ""shiny"" exterior of their lives. In a polygamist Mormon family live three wives and their husband, Bill. Barb is the first wife and sometimes longs to be the only one, though doesn't show her true feelings to her husband, nor the other wives. Nicki is a compulsive shopper, having growing up in an illegal polygamist compound. She is in thousands of dollars of credit card debt, unbeknownst to her husband. Her father, Roman, is the leader and ""prophet"" of the polygamist sect Nicki comes from. Margene, the youngest of the wives, longs for a life she once had, where she could freely befriend the neighbors and often struggles with being a young mother with her little boys. Because of their precarious situation, the family has to hide the fact they are polygamists, a practice outlawed not only by the Mormon church but the U.S Government as well. Roman, Nicki's father, gave Bill money to start a hardware store, Henrickson Home Plus. However, Roman has become greedy, insisting that he get a cut of all the profits made not only from the first store, but the second as well. The conflict between Bill and Roman has come to the point that one or both of them may lose their lives at the others hand. Bill makes attempts to bring Roman down along with all his underhanded business deals, but Bill's mothers, his father and much of his extended family would be punished along with Roman for practicing polygamy. Will Bill have to choose between the family that raised him and the family he has now? We have yet to find out. I have become thoroughly addicted to this show! It's sexy, it's funny, it's exciting and it's flat out great. I don't get HBO, but I go out of my way to make my parents record it so I can watch it when I visit them. It's rare I'll make that much of an effort for a TV show. This one is different. I highly suggest, that if you're longing for a fresh, inventive story, that you check this one out. You won't be disappointed!",2006
9,"I think this is a really good show. There are few shows that I can actually keep watching after a few episodes without getting bored, and this is one of them. I am a straight man, and to me this does seem kind of like a show aimed towards women, but the characters bring this show to interest of me. The actors are able to make it look so believable. Even though this is about a polygamist family, a lot of the things that happen on the show can happen in real life, especially the problem Bill is having with Roman. I'm sure that happens a lot in business, especially small businesses, people just do not hear about it. My overall rating is a nine, and I also have to add that the protests the Mormons have with this show really is not true. I hope that there are several more seasons to come, and I really hope that the next will not be as long as HBO is thinking it is going to be.",2006
9,I wasn't that interested in Big Love at first. I used to live in Utah and the issue of polygamy is a serious problem with young girls being forced to marry much older men. My wife even gets upset at me for watching the show because she thinks the show is more about pedophiles than polygamy.,2006
3,"I just wanted to clarify some incorrect information that omgwtflolbbq from washington, DC stated in his comment about the show. He mentions that most think of polygamists (and the LDS in general) as deranged lunatics that are totally out of grasp with today's world. While that may be true, I think it is important to note that polygamists are not LDS. Polygamy was officially discontinued by the LDS Church in 1890. In fact, their current church leader, Gordan B. Hinckley stated, """"This Church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this Church. . . . If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church."" HBO placed a disclaimer on the first episode of ""Big Love,"" stating the LDS Church's position, and I believe the show's creators say they have taken pains to separate Latter-day Saints from polygamists.",2007
10,"Finally, an HBO program I can truly enjoy. The writers write real dialog and scenes and don't rely on foul language to entertain audiences. Each episode is better than the last! The only thing I might caution the writers about is not to make everyone in the ""real"" world evil or suspicious of the bigamist lifestyle. There are people, who are not involved in the HLDS that are likable, tolerant people who would make good neighbors.",2006
1,"I have a HUGE problem with the show. Put the Hollywood gloss on it and try to make it seem OK. They have problems just like you and me, right? Only trouble is, polygamy was outlawed a long time ago and the only people still practicing it are fanatics using it as an excuse for being a pedophile.",2006
7,"This show is very well written (to an extent), executed and acted. I appreciate the complexities of the dialogue and plot lines, but there is an inherent creepiness that I have trouble with. All the religious mumbo jumbo is hard to watch - especially against the hypocrisy of religious fanatics who have multiple wives. I know that's part of the point - part of the dynamic of the show, but still. One thing I don't get and I don't think is adequately explained is why would someone want more than one wife. The financial and other burdens are enormous, as the show illustrates. There are allusions to religious reasons, but that's about as far as it goes.",2007
7,"I am a lifelong, practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served a LDS Mission and was married in the Salt Lake Temple. I lived in Utah from my infancy until I moved to the East Coast at age 27. The Church is absolutely integral to who I am. I love being a member and I try (with varying success) to follow its precepts.",2013
1,"Surprisingly boring for an HBO series. It appears HBO thought polygamy and the archaic mormon religious practices would be more appealing to men. The plot is extremely boring. This guy is a polygamist and has a home improvement business. Take a ride around Salt Lake City and you find this is still completely true. There are large compounds with several houses and one large brick wall or fence. All the plots displayed in the show are true. Warren Jeffs showed the world people like the fictional character Roman Grant is actually not fictional and completely true. The show has no change in plot and is totally boring!!!! HBO cancel the thing and work on something new! If ""Big Love"" is all HBO has to offer I think they jumped the shark!!!!!!! What hapend to shows like The Sopranos and Curb Your Enthusiasm??? Now HBO provides Entourage which ""jumped the shark"" last year and Big Love????????",2009
9,"A few years back, when I saw that HBO was releasing a show about a polygamist family in Utah, I naturally bocked and thought to myself what a dumb idea.. Bill Paxton also isn't the one to sell you on watching anything with his face on the cover.. (sorry Bill, I just remember you from Weird Science) Well I was completely wrong about the entire show.. After a friend mentioned to me that the show was entertaining, I picked up the first season on DVD and immediately fell in love with it..",2009
10,"I really like this show so far. I have only seen a couple of episodes, but can't wait to rent the whole thing. For those people who are talking about whether this show glorifies pedophilia, or whether it encourages prejudice against the Mormon Church, I think you're missing the point.",2007
1,"This show serves one purpose and one purpose only: to make polygamy more acceptable to the American and global audience. This is kinda sick. Polygamy in this form inevitably leads to abuse of power by old men over very young girls. To have it de facto institutionalized is even sicker. And no matter what the lsd-church says, they condone it, secretly support it. Gay marriage doesn't have this potential for abuse, because gay marriage, like heteros, doesn't put young girls in a embedded position like polygamy. Also, children run a greater risk of the poverty trap, especially in America where social security is lacking. If the husband loses his business, he has to support more children who will be poorer. ",2007
1,"OK , i've only seen the last episode , but that's enough. I can't believe this series presents what are basically a bunch of religious loonies as being normal. Are we supposed to care what happens to this bunch of morons ? Morons missing the letter ''m''. Judging by the sentimental background music it seems we are. The potential was here for a satirical comedy , instead we get deadpan seriousness.",2014
8,"I recently saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.I was eagerly anticipating it's release, being a big fan of Pi and Requiem for a Dream. That being said, this is a hard film to watch. It has beautiful cinematography, an amazing score, and very impressive acting, however, I feel that the advertising on the film has been misleading. This is not a love story, nor is it a science fiction film (although it has elements of both).The true core of the film is a man dealing with the idea of mortality. The fact that he, and everyone, especially the woman he loves, is going to die. This is nothing like Requiem for a Dream or Pi, it has a heavier feel to it, though it is not as depressing. Not everyone will like this movie, in fact, I find it hard to believe that this will get a wide release, as it is not a commercial film. It is an art film, a discussion piece, a beautiful poem about the fragility of life and the idea of forever.",2006
10,"Fantastic in every sense. This film is indeed poetry, and a beautiful testament to love and the cycle of life, and the impermanence of death. Wow. The script is tight, and the non-linear presentation works very well. The scene compositions were exquisite. The score enhanced without being overbearing, which is so often the case in contemporary film.",2006
10,"...and here I shall attempt to review what will one day be a classic in the hopefully near future. The Fountain is many things. It's a touching film. It's not long, though, clocking in at around 80 or 90 minutes, but it does manage to pack in enough emotion to out-do every single lame, candy-assed Hollywood romance ever created, or almost. More movies should cut down their running times like this; because there is not a wasted moment in The Fountain from start to finish, despite the movie still moving at an gregariously slow pace. You won't find any blitzed, seizure-inducing cut-and-paste editing scenes here, and there are no epic explosions and battle scenes either. What you will find, though, is an entire treasure trove of realistic passion and jaw-dropping emotion, and that's the strong point of this movie. Nothing here feels contrived or derivative or fake at all - this is a story of a woman with a lot of love in her heart and a passion for life in general, and a man who would do anything to preserve the same love for all eternity. That's the Fountain.",2007
9,"""TheFountain"" is a story tackling three different time periods. Tomas (Hugh Jackman) is a 16th century Conquistador on a bloody hunt though a hidden Mayan temple to retrieve sap from the mythical Tree of Life for his queen (Rachel Weisz), who is desperate for immortality. In 2005, Tom (Jackman) is a doctor frenetically searching for the cure to cancer to save the life of his wife Izzi (Weisz), who is in the final throes of her battle with death. Five hundred years later, Tom travels through space on a quest to reach the place of tranquility that Izzi spoke fondly of, using the Tree as a device to get him to the answers he needs to rest his weary mind....",2006
9,"As I am writing this review I really don't know where to begin. It reminds me of the feeling I had as I left the theatre after the closing credits rolled on the film ¬ñ absolutely bewildered. I can't even begin to describe the feelings I left the theatre with, but I can safely say that no movie has affected me quite like The Fountain has since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind two years ago (and which is known as my all-time favourite movie). All summaries and attempts to present the plot are futile, because it's truly indescribable. Any summaries you may have read about the plot are null and void ¬ñ truly, don't judge the film by what it sounds like it will be like. It's a movie you must experience for yourself. And what an experience it is.",2006
10,"This is not a film for any one public. Americans, often ignorant of philosophy and mythology (by and large) would stumble awkwardly through much of the film, wondering what the hell is going on. Others still would prefer to call the film pretentious and drenched in metaphysical bull----. Woe it is to the archetypes. No one knows how to reach the elemental, the archetypal arena of human experience anymore; a fact proved by so many other reviewers penchant for searching for the ""realism"" within the movie. (cf. Roger Ebert's review; this is a thoroughly stupid and ignorant way of viewing such a film...it seems that the Divine Comedy would be cast aside today, because Dante does not describe Paradise in a ""realistic"" fashion. Which of course is worse than nonsense...its f---ing stupid.) ",2007
10,"I had the immense pleasure of viewing this film for its second screening ever, when it was showcased at Chicago's International Film Festival. Fans of Aronofsky who enjoyed the intensity of 'PI' and 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM' will find that Darren's primary thematic focus has shifted yet again from the mind and gut ('PI' and 'REQUIEM', respectively) to the heart. However, don't take this to mean that 'THE FOUNTAIN' isn't intellectually engaging or visceral in its impact.",2006
9,This is one half of a review. Some films need to be seen more than once to be fully grasped. This is one of them.,2006
10,"I got into a screening by chance a few weeks ago to see a film called The Fountain up here in New York. I was about to see another film while a young woman approach my wife and I about a free screening while I was about to purchase my tickets. Now I have heard that special screenings are common and they happen at random, so we took her up on her offer right away and followed her inside the theater to a screening room. Now considering that the film was free, we were going to take it in stride that it might not be any good and just go along for the experience. Long and behold, the movie started and we were treated to one of the most intelligent and emotional films we have ever seen. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman play eternal lovers who are destine to live in tragedy though their several incarnations over time (Past, Present and Future). Thou these experiences, they are forced to look at the meaning of life and death and if there is a way to prolong their love thou it all. The running theme in the film is about acceptance, wheatear it's trying to live your life to the fullest or to die with dignity and that is more represented in the present day time line of the film where Huge's character is trying to save his wife (Rachel's character) from an inoperable brain tumor. This segment of the film is where the film's emotional bread and butter come from and in my opinion the best part of the whole movie. There is a realistic chemistry between Hugh and Rachel and it carries the far reaching premise of the film with such emotional gravity that you are able to feel their love for each other. Rachel Weisz has always been one of my favorite actors and here she delivers her best performance to date with such passion and such grace that you can literally feel her inside of your heart. She makes her character a real three dimensional person, with real flaws, real fears and real bravery. In any lesser actress's hands, Weisz's role would have been a sad stereotype of a dying woman who is brave in the face of death, in Weisz's powerful hands however, she makes her human and that in my opinion is even more heroic and realistic. Hugh Jackman is extraordinary as well and this performance will prove to everyone that he's among the best actors we have around. In any other lesser actor's hands, Jackman's role would have been the stereotypical man on a mission to save his wife but in Jackman's hands, he give an emotional complex performance of a man who is trying to come to grips with his own fears of loss while watching his wife slowly comes to grips with her own mortality. The climax of the film is set on some kind of spiritual plain where all the stories of the characters come together to give an impression of ever lasting life and renewal.",2006
9,I was lucky enough to see a screening of The Fountain a few days before the official release date. ,2006
10,"Easily the best film I've seen this year. Although definitely not something for everyone, as a lot of people will probably think it's difficult (which it is). But going into the film open-minded, and just taking it all in (the beautiful cinematography/visual effects, powerful writing, wonderful direction) you'll no doubt have the time of your life. It's more thought provoking and emotionally/visually draining than anything else I've ever seen (somewhere along the lines of ""Donnie Darko"" or ""2001""). I can't say enough good things about it honestly. I just can't wait to go see it again. No doubt a movie that will be talked about for years, and will probably be under-appreciated forever.",2006
10,"I do not know how to sum this movie up in this review, and to try to would be an injustice to Darren Aronofsky's genius. So I will just state the facts. I saw this film at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was blown away. This movie is so original and so breath taking. There is only one word that I can use to describe it: BEAUTIFUL. Darren Aronofsky is a genius and the greatest film-maker of our time. He is a visionary, and one of the greatest script writers. Hugh Jackman's performance ranks among the greatest male screen performances in cinema history. Rachel Weisv is amazing, as is Ellen Burnstyn, and Sean Patrick Thomas. Clint Mansell teams up with The Kronos Quartet and the Scottish rock band Mogwai to bring us some of the most beautiful and epic music I have ever heard. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is breath taking. It is so simple, yet so effective and so amazing. Jay Robinowitz deserves special mention here because the movie is so well put together it flows, and as an editor myself, I can understand how hard that must have been. The three time lines weave in and out of each other flawlessly. This movie is so good I need to see it again in order to catch all of it, but this taste will be enough to sustain me for another month, when I will surely see it four or five times. This movie is about themes bigger than you can possibly imagine, and it will take some thinking, and it is genius. In my opinion, the best movie I have ever seen.",2006
10,I have no idea why the plot summary says it's a story spanning one thousand years. ,2006
10,"I was fortunate to see this at the Toronto Film Festival. While I have not seen Requiem for a Dream or Pi, I was fascinated by this film after hearing about the reaction in Venice. This is one of the most thought provoking & evocative movies I have ever seen. I think it is a movie that people will either love or hate, there doesn't appear to be a middle ground.",2006
10,"I got passes to see an advanced screening of this in Boston, and then got to meet Aronofsky after the screening and ask him about the film. I absolutely adored his earlier work (PI and Requiem for a Dream), but as he said at the beginning of the Screening ""For those of you here to see requiem for a dream part II, go home, this is not it."" That comment best gets you ready to see this movie. It takes place during 3 different time periods, simultaneously and actually pulls it off!!! It doesn't have as much of the Hip-Hop montage that Darren is known for in his other films, but while watching, you can still tell it is one of his films. Aronofsky has evolved as a Director and the Fountain is a shinning example of his evolution. It is BY FAR one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a VERY long time. It's hard to believe that it came together as well as it did after it was dropped by the studio a few years ago as being ""an impossible movie to make"" and it took Darren 7 months of coffee and late nights to finally rewrite and re-story board the entire film and convince the studio to give him another chance! Another interesting thing to note is that there is only 1 CGI used in the entire movie (which considering it's amazing visuals is very hard to believe). Instead, he hired a chemist so that he could film the Trippe backgrounds through a microscope (much like 2001 a space Odyssey)and give the film a more natural feel. Another cool fact is that Darren is tone mute, which means he can identify the difference between different musical notes but can't differentiate them when he tries to reproduce them (like singing or playing instruments). He said that he spent almost as much time on the script as he did working with the Kronos Quartet on the soundtrack and that the soundtrack was finished BEFORE any shooting for the film occurred. All in all I believe that The Fountain is a MUST SEE for ANY movie goer this year, as it's by far the best movie of the year. This is one of those films that stays with you a long time, even after the film has finished. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",2006
1,"Here it is... the movie I knew Aronofsky was capable of; after the ""Look at me, I'm shaking my camera"" singularity of Pi... And after the ""starts-in-human-squalor-and-goes-lower"" one-note experience of Requiem for a Dream... Aronofsky has contributed a real service to humanity by providing a litmus test for blind-dates. Just drop the name of this piece of overwrought obfuscation into a conversation, and if your new friend gets excited, you can spare yourself an entire evening, at the very least, with a complete poseur.",2008
7,"How very sad it is when a great film is spoiled by an ending that simply isn't in-tune. Darren Aronofsky received the Visionary Award 2006 at the Stockholm Film Festival where I watched 'The Fountain', which should serve as a mark of his momentous, earth-shatteringly beautiful visions in breathing life into a universe dependent on the delicate cycle of life and death. It is not until the ending, however, that the film abandons all other components and overdoses on the latter.",2006
9,"I just came home from the North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. After hearing that this movie got booed by critics and hailed by the public audience in Venice, I knew it had to be good. A movie that could split crowds just had to be. Having seen both ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For A Dream"", I had pretty high expectations of it. ""The Fountain"" did not let me down, not one bit. The film was a visual spectacle and a beautiful story of love, death and learning how to mourn. Thematically, in the end, at least as I see it now (after about an hour or so of thinking about it), the movie is about acceptance. The acceptance of all our fates, in the end. The fact that we will always return to the earth and it's just inevitable. And as humans, the only way we can get past the death of a loved one is to learn how to mourn, accept and move on. My take on the ending is that to seek immortality is to knowingly or unknowingly seek your own death. So, immortality isn't a way to live forever in the living world, it's to die and live for eternity in the afterlife. Now this is just my opinion on the movie. I may be wrong with my interpretation, as the plot is covered in several layers of metaphors. So I may need to see this film once again. But for now, this is where I stand. For those seeking a great Aronofsky film, you won't be disappointed. This man's way of storytelling is just phenomenal. The film is screening again at Ryerson on September 14th at 15:00. If you are in the neighbourhood, I'd suggest going to the screening before it's wide release.",2006
1,"Thought the movie was boring, pretentious, and predicable. Many elements of the artsy-fartsy stuff were clich√© (for example: the silent walking scene with Tom - until he almost gets hit by a car, the inverted swing around camera-work when Tom rides the horse by/ drives the car by) I couldn't get myself to care for any of the characters: wasn't drawn in to Tom's plight; Tom and Izzy's love for each other just didn't seem to resonate. Somewhere at about the half-point of this movie, I decided that Keanu Reeves (with that slightly confused look of his) would work better than Hugh Jackman.",2007
1,"What a waste of time! I realize that most movies do not live up to the hype or promotion but I had to look several times during the viewing to see if I read the right description. While I appreciate the cinematography and imagery of the film, it still really sucked as a movie. I spent the first hour wondering how they would tie all the ethereal visual crapola together into something resembling coherency, then when I realized they were not even going to try I began to wonder how they would end it gracefully. Guess what?? They didn't. And by that point I was not even surprised.",2008
10,"Its hard to know where to start. I will now attempt to transpose a tapestry into a stick drawing. The basic element of the story is that we cannot live forever in our current state. In the Bible, it says Man was cast out of the Garden of Eden to prevent his access to the tree of life. It says that God did this so that man would not live forever in his sinful state. The Bible then says that God placed two Cherubim with flaming swords to protect this tree. According to the Mayan creation legend, the first man was slain before the foundation of the world, and from his body and blood, the tree of life sprang. These two religious stories are the basis for The Fountain.",2006

1,"I've read, with great interest, the various interpretations and comments on The Fountain and while I appreciate that the film was open to interpretation and probably deserves re-watching to appreciate its finer points, I can't help feeling that it was left so open as to be almost utterly incomprehensible (assuming one was watching it without the synopsis to hand). I persevered in the hope that it would all become clear - it did to some extent but it was such a difficult and baffling experience that I can't say I would want to bother with it ever again. I thought it was pretentious in the extreme. For those of you who got something out of it, I'm pleased otherwise it would have been a complete waste of time, money and talent.",2009

10,"Not since Knots Landing have writers been able to introduce the television audience with characters that you want to get to know and want to follow. Desperate Housewives started out this way, but sadly lost it in season two, I hope they retain it back. The interaction of the siblings on B&S is fresh, interesting, real, and normally dysfunctional, and they admit it. This is The Waltons with Wine. They want to be perfect but they know their not and Sally Field ( THE BEST ACTRESS EVER ) just leads the pack great. She is a MOM all the way, and she puts her children first, even as they get older. I applaud ABC for listening to the fans and keeping the show, I also applaud the writers for great lines, humor and actually making the characters on this show believable....... I can honestly say that not since 1993 when Knots Landing went off the air, have I looked forward to an hour of sitting in front of the T.V.",2006
9,"The pilot managed to introduce a large cast of complex characters while maintaining individuality and clarity--and the characters and their problems were interesting to boot! Calista Flockhart gets to use her very real acting ability portraying a character who has very little in common with Ally McBeal. Tom Skerritt and Sally Field are terrific as the parents, and each of the brothers and sisters has his or her own problems to deal with, and yet the story doesn't have the feel of a tear-jerking melodrama. The ending of this episode was a shocker, and it will be interesting to see if the writers can maintain the tension in future episodes.",2006

10,"I was pleasantly surprised to watch the premiere episode of Brothers & Sisters. It is such a refreshing change to watch a well written drama with talented actors instead of the all too common prime-time shows which consist of murders, blood, sex, violence & bad acting. I had really given up on prime time television. I am sickened by the amount of graphic violence that have become commonplace in television shows. That is not entertainment to me! I loved every minute of Brothers & Sisters & cannot wait to see next week's episode! The story line is realistic, yet still entertaining. During commercials my husband and I were excitedly discussing the characters and the story that was unfolding. Thank you for offering such a great program~I have been waiting for a show like this for years!",2006
10,"Just excellent!!! I don't know why TV companies are trying to hide some talented actors just like Flockhart...She is an outstanding actress..and from her first 10 minutes of the show I knew I was going to love this show..with all of its relations and characters... This show is a breath-taker and I just love it...and I can't wait to see the more of it... we are all waiting... The characters and their problems were interesting to know! Calista Flockhart gets to use her very real acting ability portraying a character who has very little in common with Ally McBeal.

10,"Today this show premiered and I thought it was great! I love the relationship between the brothers and sisters, and the relationship between Kitty(Calista Flockhart) and Nora(Sally Field), because it is full of drama and argumentation, but when it all boils down to it they love each other so. I am looking forward to many more years of this show and I hope others enjoy it as much as I have. It has a wonderful cast starring Sally Field, Calista Flockhart, Balthazar Getty and Rachel Griffiths just to name a few. I also love how they incorporate politics into this family-oriented show, and they incorporate 9/11 as well. Everyone should tune in next Sunday to watch this show it is very enjoyable!!",2006
10,"Wow! I couldn't wait for the commercials to be over! I think this ""is"" my NEW favorite show! I can't wait for next week. Wonderful Acting and Writing! Make sure you turn in next week to watch. The hour went too fast. Sally Field is AMAZING! As well as Calista. A few new folks that mix well with those two ladies. Highly recommend. It's a breath of fresh air watching a new show like Brothers and Sisters. I'm from a family of 7 kids. So it's neat to see all the dynamics. The show has already surprised me by the first night's ending... Again, I almost can't wait for next week. Great show to watch after Desperate Housewives. I hope this one sticks around. I think it will. There's a big fan over here!",2006
9,"I started watching this show because of the names, but stayed because it was kinda good. I liked it. I like all the characters. Maybe I like it cause I relate to the story-line, but I think its a good story. The 10/8 air-date episode is the first one I've seen. I hope it sticks around for a while. Sally Field is always awesome and fun to watch. Other than her and Calista, it seems the other actors and actresses are holding back a little. But such is the beginning of a series and I think it has a lot of potential, as long as the writing holds out (and could serve to get a little better.... BUT ITS STILL GOOD). I could really love this show.",2006
7,"I enjoyed the show but cannot help but see it as a regular TV version of HBO's ""Six Feet Under.""

The patriarch dies unexpectedly in the first episode leaving mom and the kids to figure out how to pick up the pieces including taking over the operation of the troubled family business.",2006
1,"I keep running into this awful, awful show as it is run between two good shows here in Australia. I have to say I am embarrassed for Rachael Griffiths, who is a very talented actress and who has generally appeared in pretty good stuff prior to this dross. She does her best with what she is given, but no-one is good enough to save this rubbish.",2009
2,"..., except even more banal?",2009
7,I have finished watching the first episode and thought I would like to leave a slightly more favourable review than the previous poster. I like to give a show more of a chance to pique my interest than 5 minutes so I sat and watched the entire episode. There were the usual introductions to new characters... since it's a rather large ensemble depicting a family of adult children and two older parents there wasn't much room for in depth intros but it was adequate for a premiere episode.,2006
1,"I don't know, maybe I'm too lad-ish and distant to US culture to enjoy this show, but this is so utterly boring and pointless show that almost painful to watch, and the reason is that this show is full of clich√© and there's nothing more in this, period.",2007
10,"This show has me hooked!! It's an amazing balance of all the conflicts and joys within a family. It delves into diverse belief systems; political, social and religious, and how they affect this family's structure. There are times of division, and amazing times of solidarity, as if to say: We are family...we fight, we love, we are at polar opposites sometimes, but we are always together. ",2006
10,"The writing makes you feel it's right out of life today. No phony, pretentious, over reaching, stale or trite scripts. The characters are relatable and all have redeeming traits, while not afraid to show their flaws, vulnerable side or sensibilities. This family talks to each other. Even about the tough stuff. How great is that?! The acting? Love Matthew Rhys. He does more with his face and body movements than three actors combined. And the reason it is so outstanding is that it is all minimal - the viewer isn't condescended to - you get to discover the details of his acting to appreciate his naturalness and charisma. I can't get enough of this kind of acting. Dave Annable shows a wide range, funny and intensely serious. Marika Dominczyk makes it look easy to come across so natural on camera. Keri Lynn Pratt oozes love of being alive. If it was for sale, I'd buy some. Balthazar Getty is sensitive and is that fearlessness? Whatever it is - it is working for him. I like Luke MacFarlane with Rhys' character. He seems appropriately mercurial. Sally Field strikes all the right chords, as her own woman and as mother to five individuals. A tough balancing act and she does it winningly. Sarah Jane Morris is so believable as a solid and sensitive person who loves Tommy. Rachel Griffiths covers all the bases with just the right touch. The comic timing by this cast keeps me laughing out loud every episode. Each and every cast member plays his or her part with thoughtfulness and gives us a gift with this best show on TV today. I Lo-ove Brothers and Sisters.",2006
10,"This show is absolutely the most wonderful show on television right now. The story lines are very well conceived and written. This is without a doubt one of the most amazing casts ever assembled. Their chemistry is undeniable and you have absolutely no problem believing that these people are family. How refreshing it is to see that one of the Brothers is not only gay, but in a very warm, tender, and even funny new relationship. I sincerely hope that Kevin and Scotty stay together for a long time and that we get to see two gay men in a loving, committed relationship on TV on a regular basis. It's about time! This show has had me hooked from the very first episode. It has given me reason to be at home at 10:00 on Sundays. It's very hard to not fall in love with this family and care about what happens to them. The Walkers may be a dysfunctional family (as if there were any other kind), but to me they have become the perfect family (at least to keep me entertained). If you haven't seen this show, you should be ashamed of yourself! You don't know what you're missing.",2006
2,"My wife and I watched this show after several people recommended it to us. I was not the least bit impressed. The writing and dialogue on this show are awful. Predictable outcomes to every situation leave you wondering what the characters are thinking (if I saw it coming, why didn't they?). Nothing that happens in this show warrants its 60 minute running time. A waste of good talents from actors who have proved themselves in film and TV careers before coming to this show. It will likely be cancelled due to lack of interest, but develop an eager fan base consisting predominantly of women who just want to watch something ""smarter"" than Desperate Housewives.",2007
10,"*Spoiler* The season Finale was last night and it was great!! I have watched this whole show since the premiere and my dad and I love it!! It addresses real problems and shows a lot of heart. I cried when Tommy and Julia had to make a HUGE decision about their twins and laughed when Kitty and Holly went at it at the vineyard. It did seem predictable at times but, all in all, it was a great TV drama; although, we could have gone without Kevin's Gay Story line...the creators could have been more creative. I loved Sally Field and how she played the role of the matriarch...she acted beautifully and had all the traits of every American mom!! I can't wait for the second season. I really loved last night's episode; Garry Marshal was great and it was both sad yet left you with a feeling of satisfaction- no big soap opera cliff hanger.",2007
1,"I am at a loss for words. If this is the standard for network drama then don't invest in that big screen or plasma because there won't be anything worth watching in the next few years. The writing is so poor I almost feel embarrassed for Rachael Griffins after her tour de force in Six Feet Under. This poor girl has talent but to have to utter those awful lines must affect her sleep at nights. Sally Fields should not have come out of retirement. It appears that she went right from Smokey and the Bandit to this abomination and all of the good stuff she did never really happened. When you can lay there staring at the ceiling and finish the lines of dialog from these transparent sappy characters you know this is a ""stinker"". When will they put it out of it's misery?",2006
10,"I watched this show AFTER it had been axed already. I was bored and just decided to watch something that is pretty well-known, but I haven't seen anything about. So I saw ""Brothers And Sisters"" running on Fox Life. Started from the very beginning and watched EVERY SINGLE episode.",2012
8,"When Brothers & Sisters first started, I was very fond of it. However, I don't consider Season 5 to be as good as the rest, the finale was good and the actors great but the written quality and story lines were not in general as compelling as they once were.",2011
9,"What I like first and foremost in this show are the AWKWARD situations. I feel like crawling under my seat with embarrassment two times per episode at least. And it's the worst kind of awkward! Just when a moment seems perfect, no clouds in the sky for once, someone says something totally embarrassing for everyone present (yes: most of the time, that would be the mother, Sally Field at the very top of her game if she ever was), and it makes everyone mad at her for destroying the perfect moment - but they find it hard to say it in his/her face as brutally as they feel it...

10,"i missed the premier. But even without watching it, I am pretty sucked in. I really went on this to say that i loved the song they played during the funeral scene. does anyone know what the song was? I would really appreciate it if someone could write me back. iamdet@gmail.com -This comment is going to lack a lot of substance. I don't have much to say- plus I can add to the fact that I'm using a crappy PC since my MAC is out of commission all thanks to my brother breaking my charger. I really apologize for this useless information. Just know that if your looking for a sweet movie to move your emotions and feel some kind of normalcy, watch this. It's something that I think some people can relate to for whomever character they decide to choose.",2006
8,"I just saw the premier episode of this show last night, and for someone who never watches network television, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I will watch Sally Field in anything. She definitely did not disappoint. I thought it was cool her husband was played by Tom Skerritt, who played her husband in Steel Magnolias. I was sorry that the show ended as it did, but it does open up story lines for future episodes. Calista Flockheart played the central role well, in that, being a Liberal, I already hate her character. When she told her gay brother that he should join the Log Cabin Republicans, I wanted to hurl. I do enjoy the back stabbing that appears to be going on in the family business, and I think I will continue to enjoy this show as it unfolds.",2006
1,"The final arc in the X-Men franchise has finally landed. Let me start this review by saying that X2 was and is a hard act to follow. In my humble opinion, it might be the best comic book movie ever made. Even Bryan Singer would have had a hell of a time topping that bad boy. So does X-Men 3 live up to the hype? The short answer is, of course, no. There are some extremely fundamental problems with this film's script which should have been addressed long before one bit of celluloid started to roll.",2006
1,"Last night I went to watch the German premiere of what I hoped would be the triumphant finale in the X-Men trilogy.

4,"X men 3: The best and the worst of the trilogy. The film begins better than the others with a lot of potential and a strong emotional charge, which leads you to believe that the second act will be nail bitingly intriguing and the finale explosive. But as the dreadful storyline, which deviates from the cartoon and comic immensely, unfolds, we are left as bewildered and unsatisfied as a diner who has been able to smell the gourmet meal from the kitchen, but is served 'Jellied eels and a pint'.",2006
1,"I just left a sneak preview for this movie and I could not be more disappointed. The only people that will enjoy this film are the ones that know absolutely nothing about the X-Men. Shame on Avi Arad and Lauren Shuler Donner for allowing this terrible representation to be completed and released. After watching the first two X-Men films, I was positive this would be amazing, mind-blowing, and above and beyond any fan's expectations. Instead it did not even try to meet those expectations. Please do not continue to read if you do not want to read about details of the film.",2006
5,"**This contains very minor spoilers** I was really very excited for this movie, but having seen footage of the Danger Room sequence at the beginning I didn't have very high hopes. If you've seen this scene, you can pretty much apply that to the whole movie. It contains cheesy dialog, sub-par performances (despite good actors), a horrible plot, but worst of all: it completely fails to represent the characters as they are in the comics or other movies. Magneto is a horrible strategist in the film- he doesn't care when other mutants are lost. Wolverine is completely out of character, the Pheonix Force makes Jean look undead rather than- you know- like a pheonix (I didn't see any flames), Juggernaut is a joke, Callisto is reduced to a poor man's Quicksilver (the super speed looks like it's from Smallville). In the final battle, most of the mutants there (Magneto!) could easily win the fight in an instant but instead use their powers in the most inefficient way possible: Magneto and Pyro ""team up"" to launch flaming cars at the enemy. Magneto could easily tear up a car and shoot everyone with a chunk of it, while pyro could BURN THEM. All the time spent on this movie went into thinking up the coolest special effects possible, and that failed too. It's not that I couldn't get past the bad plot, it was that the effects were tied to the plot in a sickening way. Throughout the whole move I was thinking, ""Singer, where art thou"". The best part of the movie- and I REALLY hate to say it- was the new Superman Returns trailer at the beginning. He gets shot in the eye slo-mo and it bounces right off!",2006

1,"I originally gave this movie a 6. But after thinking about it, and realizing how bad it was, I had to give it a lower score, after all, the only thing that saved this movie was the special effects and action.

1,"I have to say, when I initially heard that Brett Ratner was directing this movie, I was a little worried, when time passed and I saw the teaser and following trailer, I was very excited, it looked like Ratner was even going to do a better movie than X2, so I went to see it full of expectations.",2006
3,"First of all I just have to say that growing up and to this day I have always been a huge fan of Marvel comics and their expanded universes, specifically Spider-Man and X-Men. I'm still wondering what to think about this movie about an hour after seeing it. I waited so long for X-Men to be made into a movie series, and after seeing ""The Last Stand"" I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy some of the film, for example the danger room sequence at the beginning, that was exactly what I thought the X-Men fighting the Sentinels should look like. However, the story, or lack thereof for that matter, literally angered me. How do you kill Professor X, Jean Grey, and Cyclops in the X-Men movies?! These people weren't supposed to die, what connected me to them throughout my years as a fan was how strong these characters were and how they were able to overcome the problems their world put into their way. ""The Cure"" as they called was hardly developed, the characters introduced in this movie lacked an introduction, and although it was nice to see Angel, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, and Juggernaut, among others, they may as well not even been in the movie. It was as though the entire thing was one giant spectacle, and disappointed me to the levels of the final installment of Star Wars. X2 left me hungry for more, and the original X-Men film had its problems, but at least stayed true to the foundations on which the story was based. This movie left a very bad taste in my mouth; Magneto and Rogue lose their powers (Rogue before she is even given any chance to shine), three major characters die, and the main character of the trilogy thus far, Wolverine, received the spotlight role among all of the other equally interesting X-Men, yet he gets his own film afterward and many characters we fans wanted to see, if for only a few minutes, never even made it to the screen. Like I said before, there were a few things I liked about the film. In my opinion, Beast was done justice. Seeing Iceman and Colossus reach their full mutant forms was also pleasing. Beyond these few things I have mentioned, I was not very impressed and thoroughly disappointed. The moment I heard Brett Ratner was taking over the project I began to worry, and this film proved me right. As a film student myself, long-time film lover, and X-Men fanatic, my hope for good art and good movies to be created from stories that had been around for so long just waited to be brought to the big screen was poisoned by this film. I know a lot of people will say that some changes had to be made to bring the comic to film, and I agree, but not to the drastic extents that this film took. The Spider-Man films weren't entirely true to the comics, but the changes were minute and fit well into the already famous and beloved storyline. Sam Raimi nailed those films and I remain thankful for his adaptations bringing my, and many others', beloved Spider-Man to the big screen. And as far as the first two X-Men films went, I was happy for the most part. But I have never been so disappointed in anything in my life as I was in this movie. To me, the X-Men took a creative and interesting spin on a problem that actually faces humankind, and all of that was lost here. There was really no resolution, no payoff, and no story. The film could have gone in a much better direction had the X-Men been forced to face one of their own, the Pheonix (Jean Grey), and brought her back with having her face the same attacks by the humans (Sentinels)that the X-Men faced. There would have been much more room to bring characters many wanted to see thoroughly into the picture (ie. Angel, Gambit, Beast, Psylocke, Colossus, Kitty, etc.) instead of bringing in many insignificant parties just to complicate things and provide for non-stop action. We could have easily got to know all of these new characters and then some if the story had been much better devised and the movie not been so rushed. This was also evident with the film's length; did they really expect to pull all of that off in less than two hours and have it work? The action in the film was well produced, but it seemed as thought that's all there was, action. They had enough to work with from the original story lines (ie. the rise of the Pheonix and the mutant-human war), they shouldn't have brought ""The Cure"" in to complicate things. Through all of my disappointment I still hold hope for a better X-Men 4 with the final scenes from this movie, and hope that the numerous X-Men fans finally get the pay off we so well deserve for buying all of those comics and keeping Marvel in business for so long.",2006

Oh wait did Ratner think he had a Hannibal Lector thing going? Okay so they wanted to get rid of him, but then why does she kill the Professor? She doesn't want him trying to ""help"" her okay, but why not just turn him into a bloody mess, or knock him against the wall so he winds up in a coma? Instead she turns him into confetti? What the heck was that? Then after the mutants tear up the city, the president just changes his mind and the mutants are okay again? To the point where the guy with wings can just fly around in the park and no one even looks up? Some how I don't think most the presidents we have had would just live and let live. If I was a resident of San Francisco I wouldn't be too happy that the terrorist who tore up the city where allowed to go on their merry way.

I'm upset because of terrible writing and horrible directing.

1,"While this movie wasn't as bad as some of the movies that have come out today, it was by far an unfitting end to the possibly epic X-Men Series. When Bryan Singer dropped out to instead direct Superman Returns, they should have just scrapped the script, because it was total sh!t. The script was a convoluted reference at best to a very creative comic book story arc about a 'cure' to the genetic mutation. Unfortunately, that's where the similarities end. The cure is supposed to be a hoax, created to help an evil mutant bring about the end of the world with the help of mutants that he brainwashed. All of our favorite characters were either killed off or not in the movie. Nightcrawler didn't even make an appearance. And who picks Storm to lead the X-Men? She's Storm. Her powers suck. They're stupid and nobody in their right mind thinks to themselves, ""I think Storm is probably the best X-Men character."" And my complaints don't end there- not only was the script awful and the choice of characters to receive major roles unintelligent, it was also inconsistently related to the other two movies. Characters changed drastically between the second and third installments, with no explanation given. Like, what the hell happened to Mystique and Storm's voices? Accents don't just go away. F--, Brett Ratner.",2006

If you are looking for a deep introspective look at the horrors of airborne terrorism and reptilian exploitation, look somewhere else, and don't complain about it. If you are like me, and I would assume you are since you are reading my review, and are looking for a solid hour and a half of ass-kickery, then congratulations. You just hit the jackpot with SoaP.

Snakes, some gore and Sam Jackson. The plot is simple enough. A man is witness to a murder by a crime lord and Sam Jackson is an FBI agent protecting the witness until he can get to LA from Hawaii to testify. Snakes are released on the plane in mid-flight and chaos ensues. I would recommend this film. It's fun, funny and extremely entertaining. It's a rare film that delivers straightforward what it promises. A good time, Sam Jackson yelling and lots of snakes on a plane.",2006

I tried to have an open mind when I saw the movie at the theater but it was so bad that I didn't even pay attention to most of it. In fact I spent most of the movie working on my hand-held PC while my family watched. Of coarse the kids liked it, hell,they would like anything. I have recently made myself sit down with the DVD and watch it thoroughly and I have to go with original feelings on this. Did the producers, in some odd way want this to be funny? There are so many stupid things in this movie that would never happen. Oh, and the acting is HORRIBLE. Sam is usually ""the man,"" but not in this one. This movie sucked, from the awful acting of the prosecutor's killer in the beginning to the fake as hell landing of the airplane in the end. And why would someone intentionally shoot out the windows of an airplane? All od the other negative comments (which I have read) in the SOAP comments area are true!! I sit through movies that I don't like with my kids all the time but can still find the humor in them, but nothing even remotely in any way shape or form of this movie was any good at all. This movie is horrific....Awful, awful, awful!!!!!!!!",2007
1,"it looks like Samuel desperately needed money, it's it not his acting which spoiled the movie, because I think he's a good actor but the rest of the cast just blew it. even the fake snakes will nobody believe. i understand it is a fiction but common it is just bad. maybe if Adam Sander was playing the lead role in this movie I would have rated it better.",2006
1,"I'd give this a negative rating if I could. I went into this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously,the worst thing I've ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny,I wasn't even bored! I wasn't anything. It wasn't even so bad it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie. No clue how it's getting such a high rating.",2006
8,"Oh my god. I think I might still be a little excited, since I just got back from the advance screening of Snakes on a Plane. I want to preface this review by saying that IT'S NOT SERIOUS. DO NOT go to this film expecting to see some great, dramatic film because you'll be let down. However, if you want to go and see Samuel L. Jackson kick the holy sh*t out of snakes (on a plane) then this is the film for you. It's dumb B-movie summer fun, and it delivered it by the truckload. It knows it isn't serious (with that title, how could it be), and honestly, the whole time everyone involved is just having FUN with it. So go, sit back, have fun, and see some snakes (on a plane).",2006
1,"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone? It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it's not even good cheese. It's the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it. Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. I watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness. We got the crapness (plenty of it), but not the chuckles. It doesn't even qualify as a so-bad-it's-good movie. It's just plain bad. Very, very bad. Here's why (look away if you're spoilerphobic): The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene. Oh, and a guy witnesses it. So, we already have our ultra-evil bad guy, and wussy but cute (apparently) good guy. Cue Hero. Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e. Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily. Cue first plot hole. How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he'd watched the murder. Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it. In fact, I'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese (which we all know is good cheese). So, the 'plot' (a very generous word to use). Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he didn't, Hero Sam stands between the two. Cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane. As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I'll just leave it there. Passenger plane. Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is - Snakes. Yay! Oh, pause. First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. Hot, horny couple (see if you can guess how they die), dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear British guy (those pesky Brits, eh?), cute kids, and Jo Brand. For all you Americans that's an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. Now that we've met the cast, let's watch all of them die (except of course the cute kids). Don't expect anything original, it's just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious (really not) parts of the body. Use your imagination, since the film-makers obviously didn't use theirs.",2006
1,"This movie was the worst movie I have seen since ""Date Movie."" I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite. For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person. I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior. I cant believe I wasted my money on this movie.So I don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it.",2006
4,"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production. The audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend. How is it possible to be objective? This is our movie, isn't it? Or is it? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them. Just look at that prime self-publicist Eli Roth, promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'Hostel'.",2006

9,"I was surprised at how much i was NOT disappointed by this movie. I was expecting the cheesy lines, and the predictable actions (and re-actions) of the characters, but knowing I was going into a movie that was hyped as ""so bad, it's good!"" made it easier to ignore logic and just enjoy myself. Seeing it with a big gang of friends certainly didn't hinder that enjoyment either. In fact, I don't think i would've enjoyed it as much if I didn't have 6 other people laughing their asses off right along with me! And having the entire audience yell out THAT line along with Sam Jackson was incredibly amusing. ""Snakes on a Plane""- I don't know if I'd label it a ""Best Worst"" movie (it's no Deathrace 2000); I think I honestly liked it too much for that. I found it hilarious, campy, and gratifying. It's a must-see for B-is-for-bad movie fans, and mainstream followers will get a kick out of it too. Just for fun: bring along a pocket full of rubber snakes. I'm sure you'll think of SOMETHING to do with them!!",2006
1,"This unfortunate movie founds its popular success on the simple and sad fact that its viewers have been pre-exposed to tens of thousands of grotesque images and that they find entertainment in a concentrated dosage of grotesque images. This movie has no redeeming qualities -none- except to the coffers of the cretins who made it. The revolting and trite juxtapositions of sexuality and blood-rendering; the purportedly tongue-in-cheek posturing of good vs. evil; the dearth of acting talent; the unusually awful special effects; the bad miking; the racist use of blaxploition; almost all and everything a greedy but infertile mind could bring together to cause a blighted society to spend money on a movie comes together in this piece of garbage. Barring the works of a certain director of violence-without-consequence movies, this is the worst piece of brainless drivel I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.",2007
6,"I'm calling this an ""experience"" rather than a ""review"", because a review wouldn't really encapsulate how enjoyable this movie is. If I was forced to review the movie, I'd talk about how slow it is in the beginning, how although some of the dialog is witty quite a lot of it is hackneyed (a scene with SLJ telling JM to ""Be strong"" was especially cringe-worthy), and the climax didn't have a lot of tension and was a bit disappointing. Five stars out of ten sounds about right, and is perhaps a bit generous.",2006
1,"what the hell is going on in this world when a snake can jump on to a mans snake and bite it off while he's taking a leek, the only thing good about this movie is a bite of side nip from the blonde. plus if a snake can give pleasure to a woman at least make her attractive, not some fat old Mexican broad that hasn't got lied in her stinking life. I'm not even going to go into the rest but one last thing............ Playstation bloody 2, the fat one out of keenan and kell lands the plan cause he played a GAME you got to be shitting me, the plane shouldn't have lift off with the fat mess on it in the first place! if i were you i would watch maria carey's glitter for Christ sake, geeks beware you fooled me for the last time.",2007
1,"Perhaps I am the strange one, but I thought this film was terrible. I cannot see what was enjoyable about the film, unless of course they were trying to make it so awful that it made it funny. I did find myself laughing at the corniness in a few places, but overall it was just painful to watch! Samuel L Jackson has sold out his cool persona in the worst way possible in my opinion. He just made the film seem more out of place. I would expect an unknown lead in a film of this poor quality. The only good thing about the film was the special effects, but the fact that they involved unbelievable killer snakes took away any enjoyment of this. To top it all off, the pathetic attempt at shock factor (the snakes attacking rude or bizarre body parts) was laughable and I honestly couldn't care a less whether anyone survived.",2006
10,"If you got at all caught up in the hype of this movie, even so much as chuckled at any of the viral videos inspired by its epic title (or at the title itself!), you will LOVE this film.

Seriously it's not that great its not that bad. Its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous. These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say ""I'm rick james b!tch"" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I dread having to hear ""I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane"" months from now from idiots trying to be funny.

1,"I am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie ""rocked"". It is pure CG over-acted CRAP! Don't send an Assassin, it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive, venomous Snakes on a Plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to. It is not ""so bad it's good"" It's so bad I'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again. I honestly thought was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A spoof! Was I wrong. It's that whole ""It sucks, get it!"" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells ""Snakes on the Plane! thing. Well I'm sorry, I don't get it. It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, still live in their mommies basement, and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn, then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket for Snakes on a stupid-butt Plane. To hell with movies like Full metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There's no irony in watching good movies. The true decline of the western civilization. Calling this a cult film is an Insult to true Cult classics like Repo man, or even Orgazmo. I've said enough here.",2006

For me I was laughing all the way! It was obvious that all the pilots were going to suffer the snake wrath but what really made me laugh my head off was the idea a kid with ""5000 hours"" of flight time on the Play Station 2 could land a 747 along with all the attitude on the radio!!

8,"""The Illusionist"" is a unique film that combines two often stale genres into something fresh: the lush romantic period piece and the ""AHA!"" mystery thriller (a genre M. Night Shamalyan has single-handedly run into the ground recently). Helmed by a first time director (Neil Burger), based on a short story, and featuring an eclectic cast, ""The Illusionist"" had the perfect set-up to be a monumental disaster. With a graceful slight-of-hand, it ends up being something very good.",2006
9,"I am a long time fan of the old theatre magicians and have been fascinated by the wave of spiritualism that swept both continents around the turn of the last century. This movie plays off those real life happenings, with the added twist of court and political intrigue. The movie is lush - as a period piece should be - with terrific performances from a true ensemble cast. Edward Norton has the charismatic gaze that makes you believe in every thing he does. Jennifer Biel is tragic and compelling as a woman trapped by society and dubious duty. Paul Giamatti - who seems to be in every other movie these days - is wonderful as a conflicted man unsure of whom he serves. Rufus Sewell, as the Crown Prince Leopold, is that man, and he embodies the boo-hiss villain. Vain and driven, he is larger than life and not one to cross, as the illusionist comes to find out. The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension. Plus the horses are very old world with large hooves and a heck of a lot of presence. A compelling and beautiful film.",2006
10,"This movie was stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton was mesmerizing, a superb performance that allowed the story to unfold seemingly at his discretion. Jess Biel was very believable and stunningly beautiful. Paul Giamatti (sp) played an admirable role and took the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. The story was fresh and imaginative, very intriguing. Not as predictable as you would think. We saw this at a Sundance screening and the entire theater of 500+ seats was full and when the movie was over all you could hear was excited and happy chatter, lots of applause as well. Director came out for a Q&A after and was very amiable in answering questions. Highly recommended!!!",2006
10,"I went to this see this film knowing only the names of the actors, having seen no trailers and having read no reviews. It is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I was completely captivated, as were almost all of the others in the audience, judging by the loud applause. I love magic shows and was delighted by the authentic look of Eisenheim's illusions performed on a stage having at most a chair and a table, lit by limelights. Other reviewers have described better than I the beautiful scenery, music, visuals, and acting and have given the movie high marks..",2006
10,"I just saw this wonderful film at the San Francisco Film Festival as a surprise entry. Beautifully shot and realized, it keeps you guessing until the end as to the true outcome. It was throughly entertaining and innovative. This movie has it all: romance, suspense, star crossed lovers and supernatural illusions. Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Eisenheim The Illusionist. His accent flowed seamlessly and he simply disappeared into the role. The real revelation to me was none other than Paul Giamatti. Paul's richly accented role was not altogether unlike Tommy Lee Jones' role in The Fugitive. I found his scenes with Norton full of respect and begrudging admiration. It was an absolute joy to see these two pros at work. I will definitely be paying to see this one again when it's released theatrically.",2006
8,"The Illusionist is a very entertaining movie. The beginning of the movie sets an awesome foundation for the rest of the film to work with, without making the rest of the movie predictable and pointless. Although the basic story of boy gets girl, boy loses girl may not be original, the way the plot is presented with the excellent magical imagery keeps one interested in Edward Norton's character. My only complaint would be that the movie needs a little editing towards the end as the creators seem to show basically the same scene over and over in an attempt to drive home Norton's character's emotional distress. Unfortunately, this gets a little monotonous for viewers. Still, Norton, Sewell, Giamatti (and surprisingly Biel) provide excellent performances that, along with the beautiful cinematography, make a great movie.",2006
10,"I love movies of all type for different reasons. Action movies to become stimulated physically, comedies to laugh my troubles away, suspense to sit on the edge of my seat. But mostly, I attend movies to escape from a humdrum and dangerous world. ""The Illusionist"" is the ultimate in escape movies. It is gripping from he opening scene and the grip lasts until the final realization. The story is masterfully crafted and the screenplay intriguing. The special effects and illusions are entertainment enough. But all of this surrounded in the backdrop of the story, it's movement from one idea to another is an added treat. First there is the marvelous acting of all the major actors, surrounded by great support. The cinematography and music are awesome. This movie is filled with entertainment, suspense, romance, sensuality tastefully done, treachery and surprises. I have not been so entranced by a movie since the first Banderas Zorro movie. I didn't look at my watch once and the one hour and forty-five minutes flew by in delight. I want to see this movie over and over again. and I will still marvel at its perfection. You all must go and see it.",2006
9,"Hats off to director Neil Burger. He bit off a big challenge with The Illusionist, and he pulled it off admirably. This is a very liberal adaptation of a Steven Millhauser story about a magician in Victorian era in Vienna.

It doesn't try to make a political point or manipulate the audience into being for or against Bush, global warming, animal rights, the plight of the three toed salamander etc. etc. etc. It does what Hollywood movies are best at by taking you away from all the tiresome simplifications of complex worldly issues and letting you enjoy yourself for an hour and fifty minutes. It is a story of lovers and their struggle to be together and to be in love - a story that has been told a million times (at least) and never wears out. The acting is capable, the lovers have good chemistry, the villain is sufficiently believable and evil, the hero is clever and the plot is excellent. This is storytelling at its best. So forget about the war, the economy, or if you are politically correct enough to survive in this crazy world and enjoy yourself. Go to the movies - or at least this movie. Walk out feeling good. It's therapeutic.",2006

7,"Although I spotted the inevitable conclusion coming about half way through the film (Jessica Biel and Ed Norton are discussing a possible future together; her pragmatic analysis of what would need to take place set off alarm bells for me that ultimately proved my instincts correct), it is a testament to the film that I was still engaged enough to see how all of the pieces in the story would fall into place. 'The Illusionist' is a fairly decent example of a script that sets up a certain number of expectations and then toys with the outcomes before knocking them all down like dominoes.",2006
5,This is a very pretty movie and indeed for all intents and purposes it appears to be filmed in a different period. The colours are soft and faded much like going through a very old photo album ( the album of The Empress Elisabeth of Austria comes to mind). And indeed the story is reminiscent of 'Mayerling' and many others of that ilk.,2007
6,"The Illusionist is a good looking film set in Vienna in the nineteenth century. There's plenty of romanticism, empiricism, and mysticism to ponder over as you try to keep awake with the plot about a magician, no an illusionist, who's trapped by his class, born the son of a carpenter, and can't have the woman he really loves, a duchess, who's equally trapped in her royal status. Not to sell the film short, the story includes a career police officer who's pushed and pulled by a cruel crown prince who promises to make him mayor of Vienna in exchange for his complicity. Their relationship is the film's most interestingly done facet, especially as the police officer noses around into a murder that brings him closer to Mr. Crown Prince. The film's best scene is when the Crown Prince is hunting on his estate and fires off his shotgun, bringing to an abrupt end the talk he was having with the police officer. In the end, it's a meticulous recreation of a time, which isn't nearly matched by a meticulous presentation of a story.",2006

It was more of a crime/love drama than a magician story. I'm sitting there waiting for more magic tricks, and explanations for the ridiculously great acts he performs, but the story won't go there. It just focuses on the love story, like a hundred thousand other movies. To me, it was boring. It didn't deliver. Sure, I didn't see the end coming, and it was logical enough, but not that impressive. How did he create those intangible holograms? No explanation. That's just silly.",2007

3,"gosh what an awful film, really disappointing. no panache, no charisma, no genuine feeling of magic, just dull dull dull. i had just watched edward norton in the superlative ""the painted veil"" so i was expecting far far better than this. the script was absolutely dire with some of the most banal mediocre clich√©d utterly lacklustre dialogue known to man and the acting is so drab all round that nothing can lift it. what is missing? it is not understated, it is just incredibly boring and irritating. and duh - eisenheim is told by his manager that the crown prince is a bit of a wife-beater, and sophie herself tells him that if they ran away together the crown prince would hunt them down and kill them - so what does she do? play along with him to his face & run away in secret? oh no dearie me no, she has a bit of a row with him and tells him exactly what she thinks of him and what she is planning to do. and then no doubt is a trifle surprised to find herself dead on the back of a horse (which isn't credible even taking into account the ridiculous denouement. The problem with this sort of magic is that it is so downright unbelievable so who gives a damn about any of the cardboard characters). everything about this film is second rate, even the lovely edward norton sent me to sleep - he manages to imbue his character with no charisma, no mystery, nothing - just mumbles his way apologetically through the whole film . ignore all the rubbish people write about this film, it is cr*p. oh yes and all that candlelight effect is so tedious.",2009
6,"THE ILLUSIONIST 2006 (EDWARD NORTON, JESSICA BIEL, PAUL GIAMIATTI) DIRECTED BY: NEIL BURGER ~ THE RUNDOWN: A well acted, nicely polished piece of entertainment, but made with little passion and little drama. ~ It's hard to say exactly what this movie's missing; the performances are fun to watch, especially that freaky Rufus Sewell guy, and, as always, Edward Norton is amazing as well as Giamatti; it is entertaining in an old-fashioned, mystery type of way; and it's beautifully shot, but I think that's part of the problem - it's too beautiful...too old-fashioned...too much like a movie that tries too hard to impress us with its image and not engage us enough with its story. To compare it with 2006's The Prestige, a film about the same subject, the Prestige simply crushes the Illusionist when it comes to ""movie magic"", relying very little on CGI and reaching our hearts through an amazing script about humanity...the strive for success, the need to be loved and at the same time showing us how magic really exists in our modern world. The Illusionist, on the other hand, is simply more superficial in nature and would work better as like a thirty-minute TV show. The big twist at the end would be very satisfying for avid TV watchers just after a commercial break, but, seriously, when your making a movie around it you shouldn't just have the viewer sit and wait with little to no hints just to fill up time and then hit them with it and expect a big hooray. ~ Overall, this actually is worth watching because it is indeed entertaining, well acted and interesting, but don't feel bad either if you decide to skip it.",2007

But ""Miami Vice"" fails to live up to Mann's past success in the crime genre.",2006

While the insanely cool trailer makes this out to be a big, loud, mindless, shoot em' up action movie filled with car chases, explosions, and damsels in distress, the movie is actually anything but. They had to advertise the movie this way if they wanted to make money, but the fact is, if you go into this expecting what it was advertised as, you will be bored to tears, and most certainly hate the movie. I myself found the movie unbearably boring the first time I watched it. However, after a second viewing that I forced upon myself in my unwilling to be disappointed by such a cool looking film, I felt completely different about it. I was thoroughly entertained. Miami Vice is a gritty, intense, and often brutal, no- nonsense suspense drama that rewards patience and attention.",2007
3,"A die-hard Michael Mann fan, I deeply respect all of his prior work and hold ""Thief"" and ""Heat"" in the highest regard. I essentially went into the theater to watch Miami Vice expecting a reaction similar to when I viewed ""Ali"" and ""Collateral"" on the big screen. I expected to see the big Mann pull off what I didn't think anyone else could pull off... restructuring the perception of a specific actor and producing an engaging and resonating plot in an otherwise skeptical script idea. In ""Ali"" I didn't believe Will Smith was the right choice but he worked and Jamie Foxx as Bundini was amazing. In hindsight I understood why he focused solely on the height of Ali's career. When ""Collateral"" was announced, I had severe doubts as to the believability of the plot, the choice of Tom Cruise as a villain and the decision to shoot on High Definition video. I've watched those two movies several times over and love them both. ",2006

It's the allure of doing that undercover work and what happens to you when you're deep in that role of that fabricated identity. These roles protagonists(Colin Farrell,Jamie Foxx as Sonny Crockett and Tubbs) are filled by real deal. This is a cool film directed by Michael Mann. He tells that his ambitions with a picture like that was to really go exploring into some of diverse areas. It's shot in location Scout, South America. One of the exciting things about Michael Mann is the choosing real location all the time. We're dealing with environment that can often surprise us. Whether it's the light, whether it's dramatic moment with the sky, or some interior or some sort of background action that would not have happened in a controlled backlog situation. Michael gets this slickness, finding places, that, you know , that aren't even on the map.He makes as real as he possibly can. He's all about, why fake it, when you can do it for real? . The cameraman Dion Beebe gets a maximum chromatic saturation. The shooting in these places like Ciudad del Este is incredibly stimulating and exciting.It's a Tri-border area where Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet. It's such a unique part of the world. This town have people who are from Middle East, Lebanese and Syrians, a lot of ethnic Chinese and the country speaks Guarani, which is the indigenous language. These people were extras and director got to be pretty determined to get a crew to these places. Also was shot a lot of stuff in the Dominican Republic and in some areas, it took a lot of social engineering to be able to bring a film company in and shoot responsibly and shoot safely. The main shooting is Miami, it's kind of globalized city with a huge population and a lot of money, and lot of people from Haiti, Brazil, Venezuela Columbia. In the movie Miami seems to have elevated itself, up into the most sensual which is up into the air.It's reflected the storm systems, the clouds, the dramatic weather and nature in a very, almost tactile way. Filming in really swank, fantastic places, and the girls are still beautiful(Gong Li, Naomie Harris,Elizabeth Rodriguez) and the cars are still fast but doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the underbelly of Miami.The city is photographed with alluring, it's very attractive, very engaging , sensual and also very dangerous and things that we can see around the images; furthermore an atmospheric music score by John Murphy. The motion picture is well realized by the successful director Michael Mann.",2007
9,"While this is called 'Miami Vice' and has the same names as the characters from the TV show, thats where the similarities end. This is a no nonsense undercover cop thriller. There are no 'buddy cops', wisecracks, car chases, or O.T.T action, so the casual movie goer is going to be a little bemused by what they are seeing. But fans of Michael Mann's work will be in seventh heaven, because this has all the director's trademarks.",2006
6,"I thought the movie was slick and stylish, yet Mann gave absolutely no nods towards one of the biggest t.v shows of all time, aside from the characters having the same names and residing in Miami.",2006
9,"If you have seen Collateral by the same director, you have already seen a film that is almost identical in stylistic approach to Miami Vice. In fact several scenes are very similar indeed. As well as the frequent use of the vocal talents of Chris Cornell from Audioslave on the sound track.",2006
5,This movie was simply lacking.,2006
8,"Michael Mann presents the city of Miami as attractive, engaging, alluring, sensual and also dangerous¬Ö ",2007
9,"There is almost a documentary quality to this movie. Aside from one short sequence the film almost exclusively focuses on the characters at work. In essence the film is about two groups of exceptionally competent professionals- one set cops, one drug dealers - at work. And their work is a cat and mouse conflict between the two. There are almost no exposition or explanatory scenes. Similarly the film makes no concessions to the viewers in terms of the use professional jargon and language. The viewer is thrown in at the deep end, as in many documentaries, and has to work out for themselves what is going on.",2006
5,"Just saw the film today- I am a big fan of Michael Mann' films but I must say I was somewhat disappointed. The story is realistic and believable, the acting was on point for the most part and of course the cinematography was excellent. The films biggest fault-unintelligible dialog. I viewed Miami Vice in a digital surround theater,and the effects-gunshots,helicopters,speedboats,sports cars etc.were plenty clear but I found myself straining to hear most of what the actors were saying. Of course, the heavy accents and macho low voice tones didn't help. Its a good drug/crime action movie but very far from the caliber of films Mann is known for(Heat,Collateral). I remember rushing home in the eighties to see Miami Vice,I don't think I ever missed an episode. Maybe I just expected too much.",2006
7,"Flashbacks of a white suit worn to the wedding of an ex-girlfriend's sister went through my mind when I saw that there was another Television show Turned Movie. Go ahead and laugh, but I am sure more than one of the men out there had an Angel's Flight suit or some other Don Johnson wannabe be piece of 80's kitch clothing.",2006

8,Great movie...have to watch it with an open mind. You will have to watch it on its own merits and not compare to the series.,2006
10,"Being a huge fan of the show my expectations were very high, so I was very worried about if this would be another bad TV to movie adaptation. Well my friends this took my breath away. The film is very raw and pulls no punches. It give you a hardcore look at the underground drug world. The acting is great, and the action is phenomenal. Foxx and Farrell pull off a great Crockett and Tubbs. If you are a fan of the show you will also see the characters: Gina,Trudy,Switeck,Zito,and Castillo. This is by far the best movie of the year,if you never see this film, then you have missed out on a great piece in cinema. This is Mann's best work since Heat. This is a Best Picture Nominee, and if they don't think so were they are just a bunch of overpaid political saps. I went with a friend that had never seen the show and he found it amazing. The story has a lot of detail so pay attention, and the love story might seem a bit long, but trust me it's worth it. So people buckle up for the wildest ride of the yea! VICE is back BABY!",2006
8,Saw it tonight; my take:,2006
9,"Over the years, Miami has been the set of many television hits, most recently Nip/Tuck and of course CSI:Miami. The most popular show remains Miami Vice, which started breaking the barriers between big and small screen. Now, thanks to writer/director Michael Mann (who produced the series back in the '80s), Miami Vice receives the Hollywood treatment. However, that doesn't mean the movie is a ridiculous remake (Charlie's Angels) or a funny, if inspired, homage (Starsky & Hutch). This is a dark, strong, ferociously adult blockbuster, which doesn't flinch for a second from letting us know it's some ugly territory we're visiting.",2006
1,"Okay, I'll make this real easy: Q. What's good about this movie? A. Nothing. Q. Was there any part of the movie I liked? A. No. Q. And your reasons are? You've got to be kidding....where to start, there is no much that is God-awful about this ""movie."" Okay, I'll try. Direction: b o r i n g. Music: I can't even recall any. I mean, really; they could have used any of Jan Hammer's TV scores from over a decade ago, and that would've been a vast improvement. Acting: Jesus, I mean, with the box office draw they had, you think SOMEBODY would have put forth an effort? Totally, incredibly, bad acting. Action: Now here's what really ticked me off. The genre IS action, isn't it? Where was it? I mean, if you spend the money to rent some cigarette boats and exotic sports cars, shouldn't they be central to an adrenalin shocking chase scene? Nada. Sheesh! Anyway, I left the theater not only grossly disappointed, but feeling as though I had been ""ripped off."" This is one film that would have been better off left on the cutting room floor, and I mean all of it. Simply put: they don't come any worse.",2007
8,I worked in law enforcement on the waters of South Florida from 1985 until 2001 having captained many high speed boats for drug interdiction. Many of the critics stated that this movie was not all that good. I watched it and enjoyed it a lot. It wasn't nearly as corny as the original Miami Vice TV series.,2007
1,"After reading a few reviews on some well known film sites i thought this was going to be great...but the totally opposite was true. What a huge disappointment. The plot was going from one place to another and at times just gave you one big headache. Poor red herrings and over the top sub plots were shown to us as believable (I think not!). The film was just one sub plot over another and a zig zag of labyrinthian proportions of where the film should be going. And how about this for corny dialogue...'probability is like gravity...'? er..yeah, like dog crap and cheese are identicial???",2006

1,"I recently had the profound displeasure of viewing this film. Along with my two amigo's, I was shocked by the dearth of quality in this film. The first thing I picked up on was the lack of lighting. It was scarce throughout the film, leaving faces indistinguishable. As such, facial expressions were rendered completely useless.",2006

10,"Okay, so ""wonderful"" and ""heartwarming"" are typical clich√©s. I did not want to get addicted to another show because it always seems the shows I enjoy end up getting canceled (anyone remember that little gem ""Arrested Development?"").",2006
10,"I fell in love with this show! Executively produced by Salma Hayek and starring the always lovely America Ferrera as Betty Suarez, a young woman who breaks into the fashion industry as an assistant to the editor-in-chief of Mode magazine Daniel Meade (sexy Eric Mabius). Betty is sweet, smart, and always on top of things, but of course she is not the most beautiful girl, but when they say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder they were not kidding. Squaring off against Daniel Meade is the conniving Wilhemina (Vanessa Williams...I smell Emmy) who covets the title of editor-in-chief. I just saw the pilot episode and this show is a winner and I hope it stays on the air because of America Ferrera who is lovely and spirited as Betty. She is without question the female heroine that all young women need in times where women are expected to be sexy and beautiful under superficial means.",2006
10,"This show is bright, innovative, and extremely clever. It may be a spin off of a Mexican Soap but hey, if it works, why fix it. The characters blend so well together and America has proved herself to be a very talented woman. Two shows I refuse to miss each week, Lost and Ugly Betty, and now not necessarily in that order. Betty's worries between her home life and work are what most everyday average person goes through. She doesn't have weekly life altering occurrences like most title characters. Betty is not hopping into bed with a new guy every week like all the other whorish female characters on prime time television. She just tries to deal with life as it happens which is what we all try to achieve. I am so very glad that that the producers took a chance with this show.",2006
10,"This is one of the best programs on television. Its such a refreshing break from all the other garbage that is on t.v. today. What I find funny is the title ""Ugly Betty"" In spite of her bushy eye brows, braces and glasses and the way they dress her....when she gets treated so badly by all the beautiful people, it turns out that Betty is the beautiful one and all the others are Ugly. What a wonderful team of actors. I do hope this program will be on for a VERY long time and I hope the show sweeps the Golden Globes. I think the first season should come out on DVD now so I can add this program to my library. Two BIG thumbs WAY up on this one.",2006
10,"We all have an ""Ugly Betty"" in us. This show is fantastic. I love the warm messages you get from each episode. At first I was like, ""these people are mean to Betty."" or ""I don't want my daughter ever to act like that...perhaps this isn't a show for her."", but by time the episode ends, the true message that you get from the show is astounding and a show everyone can learn from. I can cry, laugh, feel sad, get excited all in one episode. The emotions run high and you can't help but feel for these characters as if you know them personally. It's fresh and such an innovative comedy. The only thing I am upset about is the channel in which it airs. It is canceling it this season and as we know, the storyline will be rushed and it will not receive the proper finale it deserves. I am saddend to see it go as its loyal viewers will not see their characters evolve into what the writers had intended. Only 7 or so episodes left...no justice can be served with trying to finalize a series in such little time. This is a series that I will buy on DVD and keep for my children and grandchildren. Thanks to the writers for bringing us such a great family show, and no thanks to ABC for changing the time slot, losing views and cancelling this amazing, witty and cleaverly written show. After ABC canceled Life on Mars, I stopped tuning in to new shows on that Network. After Betty is gone, I'll wait for Lost to end and then ABC will be banned from our household. I wish another network would pick up UB so it can get the recognition it so deserves.",2010
10,"Not the usual network fare. The story may be an old one, but the cast delivers and there are some amusing barbs that strike home. The Hispanic-American environment for Betty's family gives the formula new life, with true-to-life touches like the telenovela playing on the TV at home. Mark Indelicato as Betty's nephew is believable with a subtle touch in a role that could easily be overplayed for cheap laughs. Vanessa Williams gets a chance to vamp as the conniving, power-hungry rival for the company, and Gina Gershon offers a wonderful parody -- or is it? -- of an aging supermodel. The Beautiful People -- and the less-than-perfect who also inhabit their world, however under-appreciated -- are here in force.",2006
8,"A dramedy with a lot of heart. The humor can be pretty subtle which makes it more effective and does not detract from the story line. It also has a moral point of view that shows that the consequences of behavior can be long lasting and far reaching, and that other people are affected even when you want to believe that no one else is being hurt. The fact that Salma Hayeck, who is one of the producers, is willing to make fun of herself by being shown in an over the top Latino soap opera on the TV in Betty's house that her father is hooked on also adds to the levity and fun of the show. The ongoing story thread about Fey is a good hook, since you keep watching to find out what is going on. You find out a little more about the plot line each episode, much like a good mystery.",2006
8,"I have been an Ugly Betty fan since episode 1 back in 2006. The minute America Ferrera's plucky Betty Suarez walked through the doors of Mode in her Guadalajara poncho, I knew I was going to love this show. I've been a faithful fan for all four seasons and was truly sad to see it go. So much so that I put off watching the series finale until today - nearly a month after it originally aired. Throughout it's four seasons, Ugly Betty remained witty and engaging. Ugly Betty knew how to play up the drama, but what made this show so endearing was its expert use of comedy. Vanessa Williams, Ana Ortiz, and Becki Newton and the rest of the cast provided constant moments of hilarity throughout the years. ",2010
10,"In light of the show's cancellation, I had to go back and rewrite my original review. I had originally sung Betty's praises for not pussy- footing around the ridiculousness of its glossy world while still embracing it wholeheartedly. It was campy, melodramatic, and unabashedly fun.",2007
10,"This long time New Yorker had an instant connection with this program. When Betty first told Marc that she had just graduated from Queens College, I had to laugh at his sarcastic reply, ""That's a terrific value school."" From that moment on this fellow grad of the very same ""value school"" had felt a kinship with Betty.",2010

9,"""Ugly Betty"" is a refreshing show from ABC that is based on a soap opera, I believe from Mexico. The place and the characters are quite similar to ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" except that in ""Ugly Betty"" her boss loves her. ",2007
9,"I enjoyed this new comedy. It's a little predictable and naive in a fairy-tale style, but what the heck, it's an 8:00 family entertainment! Easy to let yourself absorbed by this simple pleasure. And it is refreshing to see a wits vs. looks sitcom, so better realized than ""Almost perfect"". And socially appropriate, when many Latino-American girls only have models such as Jennifer Lopez. As to the actors, I loved most of them, particularly America Ferrera (who is not ugly at all, amazing how they were able to make her realistically unattractive!). Also a particular mention for Gina Gershon, very convincing as the pretentious Italian fashion queen Fabia, a parody of Donatella Versace. Hope it will go on in the same style.",2006
1,"Ugly Betty is one of those American comedies using the same humour as Desperate Housewives, their is no humour! Both Desperate Housewives and Ugly Betty and loads of other American comedies are 99% drama and 1% humour. I can't imagine someone watching this show and actually laughing aloud. Clearly they are trying to make people laugh by satirising the fashion industry, but you can't keep on doing that the whole time, you need to make people laugh some other way, because when you see the advertisement for it, you then know what the programme is about, and channel 4 have been advertising this show non-stop recently, you think to yourself 'that looks like a funny show' and you watch it to see what else happens in the show. However, you don't expect to watch the same thing you saw in the adverts.",2007
1,"I'm going to keep this as brief as possible since frankly, the abomination that is 'Ugly Betty' deserves very little of anyone's time.",2008
10,"This new hit TV series is amazing because of its constant humor, enticing plot, and its strong grasp of REALITY. Ugly Betty is definitely the start of a new era of television, and hopefully a new image of what is truly beautiful in women. This show is already beginning to remind young girls about the importance of inner beauty, and hopefully, it will alter the media's portrayal of sickeningly thin as ""beautiful"". Each and every week, this new TV series only becomes better and better, and more and more addictive. I'm sure many will agree that ""Betty Suarez"" is the most positive TV role model for young girls and women today.",2007
3,"I've watched the first season of this show, in search of a feel-good comedy series. I was not even expecting them to be sensitive about the gender stuff (and they should nevertheless have been careful about that). But that issue has been covered by many previous reviews, so I will look through a more different window.",2011
7,"What a hoot! ""Ugly Betty"" follows the basic telenovela structure without playing it over the top. It is easy to see the difference, especially since ""La Fea Mas Bella"" is playing on Univision in my area. And finally!!!!! A Mexican-American family that rings truer to life than any I've seen in a while, pardon me George Lopez. The father is dedicated and loving (and present!), with a fierce loyalty to his favorite daughter. This shows in one scene where he threatens to go to the parents of Gina, the Book thief. Hilda (the ""pretty"" one) is street-wise and capable, but Betty will always be first in his heart. The scenes of the Suarez household do not take away from Betty's struggle at Mode, but serve to complement her determination to remain true to herself in a world that prizes perfection and ignores individuality.",2006
1,"I cannot believe that this show is getting rave reviews. I must be seriously missing something because I just don't get it. It is not funny,the acting is poor and the story line is lame. This show sucks big time. I hope this show gets cancelled right away because I don't even want to see a preview of this piece of garbage! I usually can get a laugh out of almost any comedy but this one did not even get a chuckle from me. I like Salma Hayek but I think she is terrible in this. Ugly Betty is so unrealistic, it is really a stretch to think that anyone would choose to look this way and even more unrealistic that anyone would hire her even discourage the guy from sleeping with her. This leads to the assumption that you would have to be attractive to have an office affair and believe me there are plenty unattractive people getting their groove on.What a shallow, insulting show.",2007
10,"I Love Ugly Betty very much. America Ferrera did a great job for played as Betty Suarez, she totally nailed it. and so did the other stars. They are all acted so well. When i watched the very first episode i knew that this series is going to be huge, and I cant stop watching it. It always came up with a different problem in a every single episode but Thanks to Betty has always the way to figured it out. Betty is a sweet, Intelligent, Confident, Cheerful Woman who has to deal with not-so-nice people from her job. As we know, Working in a fashion magazine it is not always the easy one. ",2010
10,"ABC family was hosting a marathon of season 1 of Ugly Betty right after the 2007 Emmys. It was a Saturday, so flipping through the channels I decided to try this show.

8,"When i first found out ""Ugly Betty"" i was like:""it's just another soap opera or something like that.""But fortunately my instincts let me down. By the time i started watching it i couldn't stop laughing.This show is clever,witty,hilarious,realistic and sad.And what makes it so special are it's characters and it's funny script.The actors do an amazing job.They play strange and yet totally believable characters(e.g. homo Mark and bitchy Amanda)which have depth.All the characters are unique and even the seemingly ""bad"" one's make you love them(e.g. Amanda). A.Ferrera does a very good job as this clever,emotional,charismatic,responsible girl,without making herself graphic. E.Mabius gives a performance that balances between drama and comedy. M.Urie is hilarious,every second of him is a precious comedy moment. B.Newton steals the show every time she appears with her moves,her speech and her facial expressions. V.Williams is DEVILISH!! and this is probably one of her best performances. And also all the other actors give wonderful performances contributing to this perfect result;which is,a show for everyone.",2008
8,"With ""The Perfume"" it's like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it's horrible - if the critics hate it, it's brilliant.",2006
9,"To my dismay this movie has been accused of dealing with the addressed subjects only on the surface and just trying to shock the audience with extreme imagery. I strongly have to disagree with that. ""Das Parfum"" may be a lot of things but shocking sure isn't one of them. Of course it is visually overwhelming and not only with pictures of pretty flowers and sounds of the wind softly shaking the trees on a warm summer night but what is this movie, if not a piece about the sensuality of the human being? Yes, it is about smells but smelling is just simply not one of the things you can experience while sitting in a movie theatre. This motion picture however comes very close to it. We see close-ups on maggots crawling around and fish getting their heads chopped of but also human bodies in all their perfection and people declaring their honest love for one another. It might be impossible to make the audience fully understand the world in which Jean-Baptiste Grenouille lives but it does manage to create a similar vibe that brings us close to what Grenouille ""feels"" when he smells. Tom Tykwer beautifully achieves to always put the audience in the right mood, with the help of an amazing soundtrack and great camera work.",2006
10,"wow, a serial-killer movie WITHOUT blood and action and wild chase sequences and stuff like this.",2006
10,"In this colourful and gripping film, you can literally ""smell"" the pictures. Sometimes they are captivating, sometimes awful, but they are always fascinating. A great, great movie about sensuality, desire, greed... and the quest for love. Wonderful cast (even Hoffman is excellent!), wonderful music (and the score is not ""too"" present, which is a good thing), wonderful direction. 2 and a half hours may seem a long time for some, but not for the real sensualists. The story and the film may have their flaws, but they also have outstanding qualities and in a perfect world Tom Tykwer should receive an award for his superb adaptation of the splendid book by Patrick S√ºsskind.",2006
9,"It was a masterful achievement bringing the concepts of scent in to a book, bringing it to the large screen has even more challenges, which I believe was superbly overcome in this film. The film is narrated to ensure the audience understands some of the concepts and some parts of the plot were ""dumbed-down"" to make sure the audience got the point.",2006
8,"I don't understand people who say this movie is dull, boring or bad. I guess these people are only into mindless action-movies with simple dialog where people get slaughtered in a brutal and visually gory way. If you have a mind and you are able to think, this movie maybe something for you. The characters in the movie are strong, you sympathize with them easily. It is upsetting why the main character is killing the girls, as it is actually unnecessary. The sceneries and costumes look great. I felt like I was there. The movie shows moderate violence, which is all just suggestive, you don't see any blood. I give this movie 8 points. It is a good movie, which I'd recommend to my friends.",2006
7,"I'd only heard bad things about this movie in advance and I hadn't been too impressed with the trailer - I thought the actor playing Grenouille was too pretty, giving his behavior an almost sensual feel, which it definitely shouldn't have. However, when I had the chance to see a press showing of it, I knew I had to see it because S√ºskind's book was one of the highlights of my school career. I was pleasantly surprised - the movie is well done, beautifully filmed (I especially enjoyed the period details that always felt very down-to-earth and alive), and the main character was never attractive and actually quite creepy (although in my mind, Grenouille will probably always more resemble a Gollum-like creature).",2006
10,"This is an art movie with an ending that will puzzle many. As of this writing (January 5), this movie has not yet been seen by many Americans. It has however, based largely on its European release, garnered a user rating of 7.4 already; a quite good rating. It was undoubtedly the right decision to have it open in Europe first. Assuming that Americans probably won't be able to appreciate it as much as us Old Worlders, the user rating will probably go down once a few thousand Americans have rated it here. But let me try to prevent that from happening by explaining what the movie is about.",2007
8,"I just read the book last week and watched the movie yesterday. And I have to say, I liked it. For sure, it wasn't as good as the book. On the one hand it is hard to visualize smells and on the other hand not everything can be shown during the movie. But for me, it was realized pretty well. Even you can not smell the things, you can imagine how they smell which may be due to the camera work, which was well done! For me, the actors did a really good job, too. They played their roles really good and according to Grenouille, I really thought that he was the Grenouille described in the book. The only ""negative"" thing I can say about that, is that in the book he is described as an ugly person, but Ben Wishow is not ugly. But to me, that didn't really matter. So, all in all I have to say, that the movie isn't as good as the book (which is mostly the case), but although I think that it is a really good made movie.",2006
10,"I didn't expect too much of the film as the producer, Bernd Eichinger, didn't succeed in my point of view with other book to film transitions like the name of the rose, the house of spirits or Smilla's sense of snow. they were all far too corny and even though each film had its moment, the films just weren't very good. I suspected the same to happen with the perfume. the teaser trailer was excellent, but the regular trailer spoilt a lot as it just showed too much and didn't capture the film's quality at all. so i entered the film with trepidation and was convinced otherwise. Tom Tykwer showed us again and again that he is a huge talent, be it winter sleeper, Lola runs or the warrior and the empress. the perfume is a visual feast. all roles are perfectly cast, the music, the camera, everything fits together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. And the film isn't Hollywood-like mainstream like e.g. the Da Vinci Code at all. thank god. it has lots of black humor without getting cynic, it is quite amoral and at other times just immersed in beauty - and every penny of its 50 Mio euro budget shows. how much better to spend 50 Mio in the perfume than 150 Mio in crap movies like Wolfgang Petersen's latest. i am already very much looking forward to Mr Tykwer's next film. he plays in another league now.",2006
10,"People who know the book tend to expect an exact illustration. This c a n work, but serves in any case to prove the book as untouchable ""original"" of which the movie manages or not to find appropriate images. The film has its flaws, I admit. I won't repeat the points others found. But the book has flaws as well. Art is always flawed. So S√ºskind fails to make his main character real. Through narration we understand smell to be deeply connected to our emotions, but we have no soul in the book to identify with. Therefore everything is left to our imagination. ",2006
8,"Director Tom Tykwer has created a visually lush, unique piece of cinema again. From the highly original Lola rennt, to the visualization of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's Heaven (the first part to a planned trilogy, the second of which has been made by another director), Tykwer's talents continue to make beautiful films built around emotion and characters. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is adapted from the novel of same name and, while I have not read the book, I can guess that the film version is pretty spot-on. With its narration and long silent pauses to help the audience experience the amazing gift our lead has, this story is read on screen through its imagery. As the camera pans lovingly over each object of Jean- Baptiste Grenouille's affection, one can almost smell the beauty as all other senses help to create a manifestation of the one we can't use. If ever a movie needed Smell-O-Vision, it would be this.",2007
10,"Of course, (mercifully) we cannot smell what the Perfumer smells. In compensation we have hyper-real imagery, using stunning macro shots that are extreme close-ups in startling detail - the tiny hairs on a nose, the explosive splash of a single drop of essence falling into a pool. But more than the classic beauty was also the revolting beauty - maggots in a rat, the filth of the fishmonger, bad teeth, dirty hands - all in amazing, sometimes squeamish detail.",2007

I predict this movie will arouse disputes concerning all of its aspects: director's style, Ben Wishaw's contribution to the image of protagonist, the (possible) miscast of Dustin Hoffman (though I think he was incredible as Baldini), etc¬Ö I've got plenty of thoughts on it, but English isn't my native language so I'd better be short. I'm not a movie critic; I'm a mere mortal who really likes good movies. From this point of view Perfume is a brilliant feature. There are two things about it which I admire the most:",2006

10,"The novel PERFUME came out about twenty years ago, and was one of those international sensations blending a mystery with the feel and texture of an historical novel, and adding either theological tones (THE NAME OF THE ROSE) or philosophy (PERFUME). Despite some differences with the novel the screenplay here does a fine job keeping the story of olfactory triumph and it's empty results to the front, holding the audiences' attention to the interesting conclusion.",2008
10,"This is a bit of a fable, with darkish undertones. If I said this movie was transcendental, a sort of metaphysical morality play with deeply unconscious architypes, it would sound way too planned. All of that is certainly powerfully present, but those themes are masterfully invisible. All we see is an engrossing and thrilling and entertaining movie. The 'lessons', if any, only emerge as a tantalizing aftertaste of an exciting night at the movies.",2006

At the time I'd never heard of Suskind's novel, let alone the film adaptation and as a result, I entered the cinema without any preconceptions of what to expect. I was staggered. I cannot think of a film I've seen that is as cringe-worthy, nauseating and ultimately, as ridiculous or as embarrassing as this awful, awful waste of 50 million euros.",2006

1,"This a fictional, quasi-historical film beginning with the hero's hanging, then an outdoor fish market close-up birth scene where his evil mother drops him newborn into the mud and abandons him. For this Mom is hung and he is placed in an orphanage that makes Fagin's look inviting (his new brethren try to smother the baby). He is some sort of idiot-savant whose talent is being able to identify any odor. Next young Osmond is off to Paris where he catches a whiff of his first lady-love, who he runs down and strangles, and strips her while sniffing the corpse. There are lots more naked corpses (I think 12), the magic number he needs to scrape their odor-essences into a single potion that, when a drop is hoisted aloft on a handkerchief, causes the whole town instantly to disrobe and begin an orgy that makes Woodstock look sedate. The photography, both gross and beautiful, is very good. The music is excellent. The acting and direction are top-notch. But, to quote Luther as he debated Erasmus, the content is dung borne in a silver vessel. What is most disturbing is that the packaging has seduced anyone, other than Charles Manson and his girls, into thinking this movie is either Art or Romantic. Females under 18 rate this movie the highest (8.2); same with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (9.4). Why would young women want to see women like themselves murdered by a psychopath? Am I the only one who sees a problem here?",2007
1,"From his grisly birth on the fish market stones among the maggots and entrails to his evisceration and destruction upon those same stones, the warped protagonist Grenouille of this bleak but beautifully filmed movie never fails to disenchant the viewer with his obsessive sniffing. Sniffing and capturing scent is his raison d'etre. Alan Rickman keeps his wits about him longest and infuses this mad bouquet with his sturdy sanity and wise protectiveness of his lovely daughter. Dustin Hoffman prettily plays a vain and avaricious perfumer, past his glory days, who uses Grenouille for his own monetary ends. But when Grenouille spends most of the film thwacking lovely young women on the head and covering them with animal fat, scraping it off, and simmering it to produce their essences, well, as far as I was concerned, Grenouille could meet his demise with a similar thwack at any time, the sooner the better. Such a miserable and creepy person. This film will delight abnormals everywhere to whom Grenouille can be a touchstone, his fame bringing similar sickos encouragement. For there *is* that what-if surge at the denouement. A man, however devoid of normal human impulses, could with such seductive skills rule the world!",2007

That being said, if you have seen either of those films and did not like them, it is probably fair to assume that you will not like ""Babel"" either. Thematically and stylistically, this film continues in the same direction, but increases in scope, illustrating that one incident can trigger a devastating series of events all around the globe.",2007
9,"Babel is one of the most intelligent and artfully made films of 2006. The film has two central themes - culture and communication. It also exposes the connections between these themes in the arenas of politics, religion and geography sensitively and intelligently. The tag-line, though intentionally obtuse, sums the film up well - ""If you want to be understood... Listen"" - The parable is designed to speak to people all over the world who seem to believe that the meaning and importance of political boundaries somehow supersedes the value of humanity. It has especially important messages for Americans, however. And its release was well-timed to coincide with an election (2006) which may, in the long term, provide some hope for American foreign policy.",2006
1,"Babel won tons of awards and tremendous critical acclaim. This tells us that coherent plotting and sensible storytelling are no longer requirements for cinematic accolades. Let's briefly outline some of the irredeemably absurd elements of the story: Morroccan authorities, without benefit of weapon, interviews or any other physical evidence whatsoever are able to track down the previous two owners of a rifle as well as the current owner - a desert goatherder - and locate his family. While they are doing this, with SUVs crawling all over the desert, neither they nor anyone else is able to get an ambulance, a helicopter or even so much as a golf cart to the person who has been wounded. A goatherder hands a high-powered rifle over to his two pre-teen sons with neither instruction nor apparent concern about their safety or anyone else's. Those sons - who are possessed of enough maturity and responsibility to tend the family's herds, give no thought to the possible consequences of using a moving tour bus for target practice. An illegal alien who has cared for two children since birth (a) waits until the day of her son's wedding to make plans to attend, and (b) decides to cross the border back into the U.S. with the two children she cherishes in the middle of both the night and the desert...with her drunken nephew at the wheel.",2008

9,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Babel weaves four disparate and seemingly unrelated tales into a distinct, gritty narrative about the importance of communication - and what can happen when it goes awry. The movie is oftentimes difficult to watch, with ultrarealistic cinematography and gutsy, honest performances from its entire cast, particularly Oscar-nominated actresses Adriana Barraza (Amelia) and Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko).",2007
10,"Babel is my film of the year, and probably the best film I've seen in  quite a few years.  The film looks at relationships, from husband/wife, parent/children,  brother/sister and plays around the themes of love in adversity. The  characters are all interlinked in a very random way, it's a little like  10 degrees of separation.  The film is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the US, and the director  makes full use of the different backdrops to bring the picture alive.  The characters are deep and insightful, each has a problem to face up  to and the subtle, naturalistic way their issues play out make for  truly emotional cinema. This is not a film about heroes, it's a film  about trying to make the right choices when your back is to the wall,  and the doubts that go with this.  Great movie, especially if you're a parent as your protective instincts  will kick in at least once during this movie!",2006
9,"I loved ""Amores Perros"" It was revolutionary in so many ways and smelled like the real thing even if I couldn't quite put my finger as to what the real thing really was. ""21 Grams"" had gigantic intentions and superb performances but didn't feel quite revolutionary because we had kind of seen it before - and better - in ""Amores Perros"". Now ""Babel"" and, my goodness, the first thing that comes to mind is, what an extraordinary filmmaker Inarritu really is. I suspect that his universe, even if it feels infinite, it is framed - beautifully so - between the walls of biblical references. His methods may be way ahead of the times but the roots are as ancestral as fire itself. I'm not sure where I want to go with all this but the question is, Inarritu is taking me places and that's what I long for in a filmmaker. He's not taking any of us for granted and I'm very grateful for that. His movies are experiences and I for one can't wait for the next one.",2007
9,"BABEL is better than I'd expected it could be. I've heard the beginnings of the backlash (""it's another CRASH"") coming on the heels of the Cannes Film Festival triumph... and I kind of bought it.

1,*** Oh so many spoilers *** Yeah. Hated it.,2006
10,"I admire Gonzalez Inarritu's balls and his talent of course. He opens himself up for a barrage of criticism and ridicule but at the end his genius wins. I saw the film months ago and I still think about it. I haven't seen it again because the recollection is so powerful and I don't want to mess it up by seeing it again intentionally. The Mexican woman with the white kids in the desert has become part of my nightmares. What an enormous thing for a movie to accomplish. I'm giving it a 10 and not because I ""like"" the film so much but because I saw myself coming to the conclusion that the film is a masterpiece all on my own. It inspires respect. Christ! I can't believe I'm saying that but I am and I'm meaning every word. In a way it reminds me of Bunuel's ""Viridiana"" a film that I hated so much it has become one of the most important films of my life. Go figure. To be disturbed. I mean deeply disturbed is a strange experience and I suspect that it has to do with being confronted by the truth.",2007

8,"If you ¬ñ like me, and so many others ¬ñ found 'Crash' (2005) offensively finger-wagging and dumb (its inherent message was: ""Racism is bad.""), Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's Babel will make it up to you with refreshing intelligence, respect for cultures and crisp acting. The plot outline is difficult to do justice in one sentence but much like Crash it explores culture clashes in life by navigating multiple interweaving story lines.",2006

10,"There is nothing coincidental about the human connection but if you're interested in finding a reason for it, for them - you would have to dig into your spirit. It was meant to be and it was meant to be in the way that it unfolds, no matter how absurd, how contradictory, how seemingly coincidental. I don't know anything about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, other than he is one of the most extraordinary filmmakers to emerge in the 00's, but I suspect he has the soul of a Christian prophet, the mysticism behind the realism of his stories reek of God and of New Testament. Amores Perros, 21 Grams (the weight of the soul, remember?) now Babel the famous, or infamous biblical tower. Gonzalesz Inarritu has put together an immediate universe populated by incomprehension and humanity shaken and wrapped in a bloody cloth of the purest linen. His images will remain with me forever in particular Adriana Barraza's moment with the American kids in the desert. A total triumph.",2007
9,"most of it was anyway. You didn't need subtitles or speaking roles to get the true impact the director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu (21 Grams, Amores Perros) intended. Babel was definitely 2006's CRASH, only more subtle. The message within the movie is that pain is universal but we did not need a movie to tell us that or do we?",2007
6,"With ""Babel"" Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has crafted the apex to his trilogy that began with the gangbusters ""Amores Perros,"" and continued with the finely crafted and haunting ""21 Grams."" Unfortunately, it seems that peak is crumbling. ""Babel"" has the same intertwining story structure as the previous two, but in hopping across continents and making the stories global (taking place in Mexico, Morrocco, and Japan), he loses some much needed focus. It also has what has now become his signature editing-with-a-hacksaw-style of chronology that worked beautifully in ""21 Grams"" but seems forced here. In fact there's one set of scenes taking place at a Mexican wedding that is needlessly incoherent in its jumping back and forth. Everything in this set of scenes is taking place at one location on one night, so why the jumbled chronology? It makes one wonder if they forgot an editor all together.",2006
9,A new director's cut of Alejandro Gonzales I√±arritu's Babel was shown last night in the opening of Helsinki International Film Festival. This cut was said to be slightly different from the award-winning version last spring in Cannes.,2006
3,"Having recently watched Babel I would classify this movie as part of another in a long series of alienated laments modern directors are making about this so-called, ""Post 9-11 world."" I found it so boring, frustrating, and gratingly tedious that I eventually turned it off and only barely made it through on the second try.",2009
9,"Just saw the movie at the Rio Film Festival. Crash-like or not, the film is not the first to tell a story of intertwined events, nor will it be the last. Discussions about screenplay similarity are irrelevant. What should be considered is the story being told by the very competent director, Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu. It is a tale of different lives and the choices people make. Choices made in extreme situations and how their repercussions are interpreted and dealt with around the globe. It is also about how misconceptions and stereotypifications are unfair and misleading. The movie will not please some, but at least it brings light to a debate on human relations and cultural identities that is much needed in the world today.",2006
8,"While I am not exactly sure why I did not bother seeing Babel when it first came to theatres, I do know that I kicked myself after it started picking up awards and nominations with some of the bigger critical societies. It looked good, but it also looked off. After the Oscar nominations were announced, I knew I had to make a point of finally seeing the film before the big night. And despite my excitement over finally seeing the movie, I am still a bit mixed in my feelings about it.",2007
8,"The film opens in the Moroccan desert: an elderly tribesman trades a high-powered rifle to a goat herder for 500 diram & a goat. He hands the rifle to his two young sons and tells them to kill jackals with it, to protect the herd. As practice, the start shooting at rocks, a car passing on the hill below, and finally a bus. That's the only thing they manage to hit, putting a bullet through the shoulder of a tourist. In the middle of nowhere, there's no medical help, and no one wants to wait with the injured person except her husband. That's the setup of this complex, challenging film. It splits into four related stories, one in Japan, two in Morocco, and the last in California, where a housekeeper has to get to her son's wedding in Mexico, but has no one to watch the two children in her care. She decides to take them along, and of course things go sour. A good cast, great acting, fine cinematography, and expert direction make this film well worth watching. It's not for everyone, but for people who are ready to see deliberately paced low-key thriller, this is one good film. The split story line is reminiscent of ""Syriana,"" but in no way copies it.",2006
4,"This is a film that is in part about how we fail to communicate and how we fail to understand not only with people in other cultures but also with people just around the block. This is the story of one family and how miscommunication and a lack of understanding spirals out into tragedy. Told in a disjointed manner that alters the time frame we have four stories: A family in Morocco who get a gun to protect the sheep they herd, A couple on vacation in the same country which has its vacation shattered by a shooting, the children of the couple who take a trip with their housekeeper to Mexico, and a seemingly unconnected story of a Japanese father and daughter. Thats what happens in simplistic terms. What happens on the screen is an often rending tale of how life connects us all in weird ways that we can't always explain. Its a beautiful movie to look at and is magnificently acted.",2007
1,"No redeeming value whatsoever. If I had been in a theater I would have walked out, but since I was comfy on my couch at home, I hung in there till the end. There is nothing here to hold on to, nothing to take away. Flawed characters can be illuminating, but these characters make mistakes that are simply stupid and annoying. No insights to be had. No revelations to be found. No laughs, no ""aha!"" moments anywhere. Some works of art illustrate the futility of life, man's inhumanity to man, and offer insight into our own struggles --but unfortunately not Babel. A shallow movie, when it knows it is shallow, can be amusing at times. But the worst thing is, Babel thinks it is saying something. It is trying to con us into believing that something profound is being said: something about our inability to communicate, something about cultures, something about families. But it is saying exactly nothing! Vapid stories woven together, however artfully, are still vapid stories. Save your $$$.",2007
8,"If you are expecting an epic cinematic masterpiece, then ""The Holiday"" is not for you. However, if you are looking for a light, entertaining movie, I would definitely recommend this film. While the previews were intriguing, I was thrilled to find that not every plot element was revealed before I even entered the theater. I completely enjoyed Kate Winslet as hopelessly devoted Iris. She was neurotic, a bit spineless, and absolutely winning. Although I do wish that her story had been developed more thoroughly. I felt a bit like her relationship was rushed through and the film spent a majority of the time focusing on Amanda (Diaz), Graham (Law), and their developing relationship. Despite the fact that I am not a huge Cameron Diaz or Jude Law fan, I was pleasantly surprised with their part of the story! Jack Black kept his character to an energetic hum rather than an explosion of crazy antics. You've just got to love that eyebrow! The scenery was beautiful! The supporting cast was hugely entertaining. I laughed out loud. The ending is fairly predictable. This is a romantic comedy after all. However, ""The Holiday"" is a great film for those of us who would like to suspend reality for a while and just enjoy. Go see it!",2006
7,"Well yes, a 2006 romantic comedy that delivers what it promises. Mostly due to the disarming likability of the four leads plus Eli Wallach. Not for cynics, naturally, but very few things are and what the hell I laughed I was moved and I surprised myself all the way through. I came out of the theater smiling from ear to ear. Listen, that's not small feast in a world that seems too self conscious to be cute, even smartly cute like in this case. Kate Winslet can't help but being truthful so, there you go, you identify with her Rufus Sewell situation rooting for her - and I'm a guy! Cameron Diaz is, how can I put it? Yes adorable. A scatterbrain with a brain. Jude Law is another than I don't remember when was the last time he was this charming and Jack Black manages to keep it real and I was taken for a ride, going along, falling happily in Nancy Meyer's lovely trap. Well done!",2007

At almost two and a half hours, I thought it might drag on, but I never felt like it was really that long. This movie is not only about heartbreak and heart ache, it's about finding yourself and appreciating the true things in life. I felt that Kate and Cameron did a wonderful job. Their characters come from two very different worlds yet they both seek the same thing...escape. They encounter so much more upon arriving at their destinations, and ultimately end up finding the completely unexpected. Jude is a star charmer as always, and Jack, well, he's Jack. Seeing this movie should be on everyone's holiday ""to-do"" lists, and I can guarantee it will be in my DVD collection once it is released. Nancy Meyers hit a home run with this one and it is sure to bring everyone a nice large dose of holiday spirit.",2006

8,"The Holiday is about two women who each have recently had problems with the men in their lives. Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. Neither of these women have ever met before, but they both want to escape for the holidays, so they talk online and decide to swap houses and automobiles for two weeks, so in other words Amanda would be staying at Iris's house in England and Iris would be staying at Amanda's house in California. Once they both reach their destinations they are both pretty bitter about men, but each of them soon meets different men in their lives who mean a lot to them and may make their holiday something to remember. The Holiday has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast and good original music. At first I wasn't really getting into this film and thought it would be a film that would probably appeal more to a woman than to me. Also the Amanda character played by Cameron Diaz annoyed me at first and I found her kind of artificial and ego centric. However as the film played on I found myself really liking this film. The characters grew on me and I found quite a bit to like about this movie. The chemistry between all the different characters works very well and their parts are all quite well written and the actors playing them each do a good job. I found that the film also developed and showed a lot about these characters which I enjoyed because the more I got to know about them the more I liked them and they were able to grow on me more. Each character in this film brings something unique to the table by being different and by really making this film more interesting than perhaps it sounds. The really rewarding thing about this film is how well the characters work with one another and that they are well written and well acted. This film is a romantic comedy and for the most part a lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because I find them silly and more for the female viewer than the male viewer, but this movie offers a lot of humour, heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy.

1,"Three of us went to see this movie -- me, who is open to an occasional chick-flick, my boyfriend who was accommodating enough to be open to seeing it, and his mother, who only watches chick flicks. None of us thought anything good of this movie. After the first scene I found myself regretting choosing this movie. Before half the movie was over I found myself busy talking to my boyfriend about all the ridiculously bad acting and terrible script-writing that was going on. The Cameron Diaz story seemed to be the main focus of the film (even though it was the worse of the two stories). Every scene between Diaz and Law was awkward and contrived. Law falls in love with Diaz after having sex with her on the first meeting. My boyfriend told me he would think she was a whore, not fall for her. I agree. Someone said there was GREAT characterization in this film, which is an opinion I, personally, do not hold. Jude Law's character starts out as a man who sleeps with a different woman every night, then with little to no transition becomes a loving father falling for Diaz (a materialistic career woman with no maternal instincts and no desirable traits as a long-term partner), and finally ends as a pussy boy sobbing to himself when Diaz leaves. Diaz's character was anything but a character. The Winslett story was slightly better but not much. She interacts with Jack Black (usually hilarious but in this movie it seemed like the producers must have killed his dog or something because there was nothing funny about him) and their story also involves some old man who miraculously is able to walk without his walker within a week (and I'm not sure about what the point of having this old man in the movie is at all besides to insert a Jewish celebration of Hannukah). I don't have time to go into more detail but I can tell you this: if you like your movies to have a single bit of wit, make any sense, resemble anything like a story that could actually happen, and are not retarded, you will not enjoy this movie.",2007
1,OK,2006
1,"Seriously, it was like someone had spilled Fondue over everything it was that cheesy. It was also completely predictable and formulaic. Winslet and Diaz overacted (and badly so) throughout the whole movie.I was actually cringing when Cameron's character tells Jude that her family was so close they used to call themselves ""The three Musketeers""! In fact, I was actively cringing for most of the film. I thought Kate Winslet's character was excessively stupid for being in love for three years with a cardboard man that used her when he needed to and then ran back to his fianc√©e. And to get over him she decides all she needs is two weeks in LA? And he still doesn't leave her alone then, but she never outrightly tell him to F*** Off, which really really got my goat because if she had the film might, just might, have been worth the ¬Ä9.20 I paid to waste 2 hours of my life on this dire atrocity. The only thing I liked about the film was Jack Black but he was woefully underused. It was also as if the director told him "" OK we're going for completely formulaic here, NO IMPROVISING, no off-the-cuff funny stuff, nothing, just work from the script"". And they probably cut any bits out that he did do on the spur of the moment. ",2006

3,"Why do movies like this get made? Is there some sort of virus in Hollywood that disables the ability to differentiate between a well written script and a piece of drek so phony, so formulaic, so divorced from any human being's real life, that its mere existence insults intelligent filmgoers? Women and chick flick fans, arise and unite! Let's mount noisy protests outside movies like this. Let's demand that Hollywood hire people who can write.",2006
6,"Although this isn't my typical pick on movies I'd love to see, I have to say I enjoyed screening this one. The run time is a bit long, and the movie gets a bit soft in the middle, but considering you're actually watching two love stories (as opposed to one), I guess the run time is justified. It still seemed a bit forced to get the story told in a descent amount of time (still over two hours). The performances were moderate to good, with exception of Jude Law as Graham, who was wonderful.",2006

There's a nauseating bit where Diaz's Amanda puts on The Killers' Hot Fuse album and dances her head off to the great band's Mr Brightside while slugging from a bottle of beer. Believe me, the cinema was full and no one was laughing.",2006
1,"Music, images, dialogue, camera shots, soft focus, scenes like the lifetime achievement award bit -- all supposed to make the audience do the one thing the Cameron Diaz character can't do...cry. Unfortunately, I caught her problem with this movie. Try as I might I couldn't find any real emotion in this movie, other than nausea.",2007
1,"Since seeing this dreadful heap of muck last night as a favour to a young relative I have racked my brains for a reason this garbage was made. Thanks to IMDb I now know why: there are clearly enough utterly and completely stupid people in the world to make it some money. But: shame on all of you IMDb users who have boosted The Holiday right here: shame on you for being lame brained, feckless and dim. This movie is less intelligent than a Lassie movie, and I tell you this: far less entertaining.",2006
8,I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.,2007

10,"Today is just one of those days, when you get tired from work and just want to chill a little, with a beer in one hand and remote control in the other. It's been a month or two maybe, since this movie passed on our cinemas, but I was not able to see it on the big screen and here I am - at home playing it on the DVD player. I like Jack Black - this is the reason I got the movie. Like Cameron Diaz, Jude and Kate too, but of all those four, Jack is my favorite and what I was expecting to see was something more like ""The School of Rock"" (2003) or ""Nacho Libre"" (2006) - I wanted something funny to release the Friday work stress. Well... I got something else. ""Different"" is the actual word. I remember I saw the trailer few times months ago, but as I now remember it was little misleading. Jack Black plus Cameron Diaz should be equal to who-knows-what, similar maybe to ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998), I though to myself and that's exactly what I need this Friday night! Today is one week since I work for another company, some more stress as You may guess and I prepared for a little fun. First of all to say - it was not funny. There were some amusing moments, but this movie for me was not funny at all and not a bad one at all either! It just was not ""comedy"", no matter how some label it. Surprisingly for me, this is one of those movies who really could make You think of the world around You and the way we live our lives. This is like ordering a sausage with fries and getting a fine fillet au champignons instead or however some would like to compare it, because in this movie, we see Jack and Cameron in very serious situations. It's not all credit for Jack and Cameron, of course - Jude and Kate did great too, as well as the director and writer did. I almost cried in few moments. It is a long movie - my player stopped at credits at 2h and few minutes, time now is 2:40am but I wanted to write this anyway. As my girlfriend sleeps next to me and I was watching the movie, it really made me thinking and recalling different moments of my life with her. I do not know - maybe I am just too emotional, please tell me Your opinion. Anyway I totally recommend the movie to everyone, really. In brief: story is not bad at all, actor play at the end is great, music is great, great level of originality, make you recall of movies like ""The Cable Guy"" (1996) a little. Great work guys! Now all of You, go and see it!",2007
10,"What would at first seem to be a particularly predictable storyline turns out to be a wonderfully written, beautifully told love story. Two women currently unhappy in their own skins decide to temporarily trade lives, or homes at least. Iris (Kate Winslet) escapes the horror of unrequited love and ends up in an enormously plush house in L.A. Amamda (Cameron Diaz), fresh out of an unfaithful relationship finds herself in a cramped little cottage on the outskirts of a small English town. While Iris is immediately impressed with her new surroundings, Amanda needs a little convincing and this comes along in the form of Graham (Jude Law), Iris's brother, in whom Amanda takes an immediate, if very reluctant interest. The story goes on from there to include a mixture of both wonderfully clich√© and surprisingly original situations. The dialogue between the characters is brilliantly written and completely believable and the little snippets of movie trivia along the way keep it interesting and fresh. This movie was a delight to encounter and will be a pleasure to watch over and over again.",2007

10,"I don't think I can add anything to the previous 10 out of 10 comments, other than that I'd give it a full 11 out of 10 if this were possible. I have seen my share of nature documentaries, but this takes the cake. Utterly awe-inspiring, mesmerizing and brilliant. I own an extensive DVD-collection, but if I had to choose 1 title and had to throw away everything else I had, this would be the one I'd keep. I have no better DVD-title in my collection. Period.",2007
10,"Thankfully, I caught a couple of these episodes on American television, which led me to this 11-part series on Blu-Ray DVDs and over five hours of outstanding entertaining and education. Looking back, I still shake my head in amazement at the things I saw on these discs.",2009
10,"The subtitle of the series is not an exaggeration; it has a literal meaning: This is indeed our planet as ""never seen before"". Right from the outset you are witnessing the most amazing pictures modern technology has ever produced: Views from space, but close enough so we may see the glorious beauty of specific regions of our home planet. Birds of paradise of such beauty that can convince you this is the real paradise and you need not ask for anything more; All the creatures are filmed in unique settings and situations (a polar bear with two cubs emerging from their den as spring comes and gliding down a snow covered slope, the strategic genius of wild dogs encircling a herd of impalas, rare views of a snow leopard and her cub, a white shark in chase of a seal bursting completely out of the sea and hanging in the air for a second and hundreds of other breath-taking shots. Feeling happy for the gift you are given and the next moment plunged in bitter thoughts about how unbelievably brutally has mankind treated it. My rating: Definitely 10/10.",2006
10,"I have seen many nature documentaries in my life and none have left me in such amazement of our planet as this series. The sheer work that went into its making alone is impressive. The shots that are captured on film are like none ever seen and remind us of both the power of mother nature and her fragility. I highly recommend this series to people of all ages as there is something for everyone. If you do watch any of the episodes, do watch ""Pole to Pole"". It is a great all-encompassing view of many animals and their habitats. David Attenborough does a great job as narrator. If you enjoy this series also check out ""The Blue Planet"", a series by the BBC on oceans (also narrated by Attenborough).",2006
10,"I have never, ever given any title a perfect ten. Mainly because I never thought that there will ever be something that truly deserves the praise. I was so wrong. Watching this amazing display of planet earth's resources in high definition is just simply breath taking. In addition David Attenboroughs commentary is spot on. Calm, informative and quiet in just the right places. Sometimes the picture is so beautiful, that one just simply forgets the commentary and just starer in awe on the beauty of the landscapes and other details. Sometimes the director feeds the viewer with juicy bits of slow motion scenes to add to the effect of the moment. I simply can't recommend this title enough to everyone. Just pick it up anywhere you can find it. Spectacular.",2007

10,"I'm just laughing at all these negative comments. I know it's hard for you PETA freaks to believe but, in the circle of life your precious animals actually kill each other. This movie is not a statement, it just shows the ""Planet Earth"". Kind of simple, don't you think? It's not an Al Gore ""made up"" movie. It just show images of our planet and what happens in the animal world. It's not a ""made up"" Micheal Moore film. It's just shows beautiful images of our planet. I mean my goodness, just watch it for what it is instead of making a big deal out of everything. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who is interested to see what goes on in nature.",2009
10,"I doubt any oil execs will see this amazing footage, nor do I think it would faze them...and that's morally and ethically criminal, as is what the almighty dollar is capable of doing to people that can sell off 'our world' as if they actually own it...All it takes is one look at a NASA image of earth, seeing that thin film of atmosphere and then think of the daily onslaught of pollution humans put in it, to realize we have an impact on the very survival of this place and its creatures.",2007
10,"OK, I'm writing this to explain few things to people who wrote their reviews and gave this documentary 1 or 3 point with argument that there were too much killing and gallons of blood were shed or something like that.",2008
10,"You don't have to be a nature film-buff to love this series. That's what all the HD hype is about - striking BIG, sharp images with beautiful music and unobtrusive narration by David Attenborough make this an experience worth repeating. From sharp close-up the camera zooms out, out... Every detail of the landscape is carved out. Patterns in large animal migrations otherwise unnoticeable reveal themselves, demonstrating the perspective of the individual amidst the immensity of its environment like never before.",2007
10,"There are plenty of other reviews for you to get the gist of this series, so I won't add my 10 pence worth (except to say that if you like nature documentaries, great camera work, beautiful scenery, accompanied by just the right level of information for this type of series, then I can almost guarantee that this series will be truly satisfying, and in all likelihood become the benchmark by which you measure all other nature documentaries, or even all documentaries of every genre - yes, it really is that good!).",2010
10,"Planet Earth is without a doubt one of the greatest television series ever put together. The images they have captured and effort the film makers have put in is note-worthy on every level. More than enough comments have been written about how incredible this series is, the only reason I am writing is in a response to a lot of the people who have missed the point of what they have done. A lot of the people who have written reviews have complained that the show has not been more political or that it will not reach the people who really matter. The people who made this show are not conservationists, they are film makers. Whoever dares to fault them for not making this series with more of an agenda should be ashamed. The point of this series was to show people how truly unbelievable our planet is. These filmmakers have given the viewer the decision to decide whether or not they want to react to our current situation, and this is the most powerful way to do it. They claim to have no real agenda, but at the same time, nobody who watches this series views it without feeling something. These filmmakers have accomplished something very impressive. Nobody who has watched Planet Earth has accused the filmmakers of being preachers, yet everyone who has watched it has been deeply affected. The filmmakers have accomplished something truly unbelievable: getting an extremely important message across to all viewers without smothering or hitting anyone in the face with it.",2007
8,"I have watched 3 or 4 episodes and the photography is the best I have ever seen on television. But I think in general it lacks depth of understanding on the plants/animals and their ecosystem, for a ""documentary"" series. For example, the episode on fungi that produces horrific tubers out of the heads of ants was amazing visually, but - anything on the ants' social structure? Which other plants/insects depend on them? Their role in the forest habitat? Anything else children should learn about their fascinating ecosystem? Nope. But the tubers sure were icky. ",2007
10,"10 on 10 from my side, echoing the view of so many others who have felt the same. I think the team didn't waste a single penny of their enormous budget and captured spellbinding footage for eternity. Almost every episode is truly remarkable and capture enormous diversity and beauty of living things around us. Serious attention has to be paid to conserving our fish stocks, rainforests and mitigating the effects of global warming. I was brought to tears at the mention of polar bears plight, blue whale's dwindling numbers, Amur and snow leopard's measly numbers and Panda's heroic efforts at raising its young. We humans have blood on our hands at having reduced such magnificent creatures to a pale shadow of former glory. David attenborough is an apt choice for the narration lending his understated but perfect voice to the documentary, speaking only when necessary to make apposite comments and remaining silent at other times to let us marvel at the beauty of these creatures. In India this will cost more than 200 USD, a touch expensive by Indian standards where pirated DVD's are rampant. But without question this DVD is a collectors item. A must have.",2010
9,"This series is incredible. It took 5 years to shoot the footage, and it really shows that they took their time with it. I bought the DVD recently, and its full of ""firsts"" in nature photography, including a snow leopard kill and a blue bird of paradise mating dance, both of which are incredible. Everything is shot with crystal clear quality and the score is at times epic, and fits the video very well. ""Ocean Deep"" features camera-work from two miles below the earth's surface and shows some truly tremendous life forms. This is basically the place to start if you're interested in nature at all.",2009
10,"Simply put, I have never seen a better series, or film for that matter. After re-watching the entire series for the 5th or 6th time this past week, I continue to be in awe. From the deepest oceans to the highest peaks, the coldest winters to the hottest deserts, Planet Earth makes you feel like you are there, experiencing the most incredible things are planet has to offer. From rare animals rarely spotted in the wild to incredible time lapses to beautiful panoramic shots from space, the film provides some of the most humbling images I have ever seen. Coupled with an AMAZING score and humble, sincere, and informative narration by David Attenborough, this epic piece of film making is Perfect in every way. Everyone I have ever shown it to is at the very least impressed, and usually in Awe. From nature lovers to computer nerds and jocks, the humbling images shown in Planet Earth makes everyone a believer in the power of nature once again. An Incredible series that should be included in all talks for the ""Greatest of All Time"".",2009
10,I really admire what BBC did all over the years for the sake of education and entertaining the world of useful programs and TV series.,2008
10,"According to IMDb trivia: ""The project took 40 camera teams shooting at over 200 different locations all over the world for more than five years."" I really think this says it all. After all, instead of the usual documentary where one or two cameramen shoot some nice animal footage, this one goes way, way beyond. In addition to the best footage you'll ever see in a documentary, you are also treated with terrific time-lapse footage, video from airplanes and it's all in glorious HD. Add to this the wonderful narration by David Attenborough and you have the very best nature series ever. In fact, other shows just don't even come close. A visual treat not to be missed--chocked full of so many WOW moments!",2015

10,"This is not just a kids show. One of the biggest reasons I love this show so much is because it involves relationships, friendships, heartache in great depth yet includes no foul language or anything of that sort. The show is well developed from season to season as well as the characters. Some of the quotes are pure genius (if you watch it you will see what I mean) there are some hilarious one-liners and scenes in the show as well as some serious moments, gripping moments, and moments that have made me laugh out loud and cry. The cast is amazing and perfect for their parts - which is pretty rare. The casts acting improves as the seasons go on and the episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Brilliant, stunning, 10/10.",2010

Gets the boat going picks up Emma and (with the help of Rikki) Get stuck on a island. While trying to get a phone signal Cleo falls down into a cave and Rikki and Emma go down after her. After they walk for a little bit they find a little pool which if they swim underwater would lead them out to the sea. When they get into water they find that the water starts bubbling and sparkling. They don't think anything of it and swim to safety. The next day the girls realize that they have tuned into mermaids. They decide not to tell anyone because they were scared they would end up in a freak show. Later on they find that they have powers over water. Rikki can boil it, Cleo can morph it and Emma can freeze it. While tyring to keep this secret but not let in ruin the lives Cleo decides to go to a party where Zane (The bad boy) throws her in the water while everybody goes inside Lewis (Cleo friends who she likes and he likes her two)is shocked to see her turn into a mermaid he helps and finds out that Emma and Rikki are mermaids to. I have only seen 6 episodes. Because i missed it on channel ten so i am now watching it on the Disney channel.

10,"This is the BEST new show I've seen in many years, and I've been watching television since 1966. The effects are superb, the actors are both very attractive and very talented. And the Australian accents make it all the more adorable. ""MERMAID"" just sounds SO much better when it rolls off the tongue of a beautiful Australian actress. You have to watch this show from the start, and give it until season 2 to really hit its stride. It gets very humorous in season 2 - truly a joy to watch. Great for all ages - trust me on this one - i know my mermaids! If this show had an advertising budget behind it it would have been a super smash. Oh and yes I agree - the music is also excellent especially the theme song NO ORDINARY GIRL. I just LOVE this show! If you only watch ONE EPISODE - be sure its SEASON 2 episode 15 IRRESISTIBLE. This is by far the funniest of all the episodes, some of the humor will be lost on you if you haven't seen the prior shows, but it can stand on its own just fine. I'm off to roll around in some ambergris and shamelessly throw myself at the cast...",2010

9,"I was just channel surfing and my digital box summary for the show read (almost exactly)""The story of three Australian teens that are able to transform into crime-fighting mermaids"".- Crime-fighting mermaids? It sounded like a lame, animated, 7-year-old, kiddie, ""Totally-Spies"" copy television show. So I waited for the commercial break to be over while I was reading the show info. When the show came back, I started watching it. It was the pilot episode (I guess it was the premiere of the show on the channel). It was actually REALLY good. As soon as the episode was over, immediately went on youtube to see if anyone had posted some episodes.-I was NOT gonna wait once a week to watch the show. ",2008
5,"Quick and easy: 3 Aussie girls Cleo, Emma & Ricki,(all with opposing personalities, for some added tension whenever it suits) get stuck on a boat, land on an island and their only way back is through magic water. From then on whenever water touches their skin, they immediately turn into mermaids, just like the series title connotes. Life is then a very strange journey for the girls and their time to accept their new powers concerning water. There's the nerdy side kick 'Lewis', a young scientist and trusty friend and Miriam the class bitch who's nasty comments just show her immature personality. Tweens will love the show, but anyone over 13 will recognize the Friday afternoon time slot and the ""kid type"" plots that come along with it. However it is good to see some Australian shows on our screens.",2006

They discover their amazing powers over water - Cleo can control the shape and volume of water, Emma can freeze it, and Rikki can boil it. Lewis McCartney, a friend of Cleo - helps them from being exposed. These series is mostly about Rikki, Emma and Cleo learning to use their powers and dealing with everyday problems, such as pesky siblings. Cleo meets an old lady, Louise Chatham, who was a mermaid in her past and who warns her, Emma and Rikki from the full moon. They have to be careful because people are trying to expose them like Zane Bennett(the Bad boy)when he was trapped on a sinking boat and Emma has to save him. Zane sees a half of her tail and looks everywhere near Mako Island for the ""sea monster"". later he and rikki date. I would recommend this show to anyone.",2010

I will say that I do love the original 3 girls and not the new ones that replace the old.",2017
6,"I used to watch this show as a kid and I loved it. The effects were good and are still decent today, the tails were beautifully designed if you watch the behind the scenes videos. However, the characters didn't seem all that realistic, the acting was decent but I'll give it credit for covering important subjects like animal abuse with illegal fishing of sea turtles etc. This show does have some substance and morals that are interesting but besides that it's dull. The underwater scenes are beautiful to look at, although there are some aspects that I just can't overlook. First of all the title is incredibly stupid. H20 just add water doesn't make any sense, if you replace H20 with water, the title literally means water just add water! H20 is just the chemical name for water which is made up of two hydrogens and 1 oxygen= water. There are a few plot holes and stupid moments that make no semblance of sense. ( spoiler alert) How Lewis first tests the water inside of the girl's DNA. It is not scientifically possible for a person to have a mermaid's tail just by swimming in a ""moon pool"" there has to be an already existing genetic material from some line of lineage. So, he should've tested the girl's DNA first and then the water to see what activated the genetics. They do explain some of this when Charlotte shows up in season 2-3 but besides that it should've been obvious. It is an enjoyable show for kids but lacks in certain parts.",2016
9,"I love the first two seasons of this show. The acting is great, the characters look like normal girls, the plot is believable, it has great effects, it's not clich√©, etc. It has everything a good series has, but admittedly, it is probably most appealing to tween and teen girls.",2015
3,"I am 13 years old and in the U.S.A. And out of all the new shows they're putting on Nick, I would have to say this is by far the stupidest and least thought out. The creators took a childish storyline and tried to add teen-ish elements to it. And it didn't work. ",2008
2,"In an effort to steal 'Charmed's thunder, Australia went ahead and created something rather diabolically stupid, that it seems almost pointless and a waste of time. H2O Just add water is a television series about three teenage friends who become mermaids, and gradually avoid danger at every turn. Although the three friends must also avoid the greatest danger of all: Themselves. Risking exposure is not a priority that sadly seems very high for them, amongst trying to control their powers. Their powers include the different stages of the H2O cycle, like steam, Ice, and liquidized water. The threats also come from below; other mermaids who want to steal their powers, and their boyfriends... From boat chases to drama both on land and off, H2O just add water promises adventure and spectacle at every turn! ",2012
10,"The Best Show Ever H2o Just Add water is the best Australian TV Show I've ever seen.The acting,the plot,the place and storyline are incredible.The Girls have some amazing magic powers,which an ordinary Girl can only dream of.To me,Emma has the most amazing power and I think that she shouldn't be replaced by Indiana Evans.That would be very sad to all Emma real fans.And the girls have got a lots of enemies:Charlotte,the evil mermaid,Zane,the rich boy,Denman,the marine biologist and Miriam,the stacked up rich girl,which they can fight with their powers.I think that H2o Just Add Water is the best show I've seen and it is suitable to children to all ages.Also,my opinion is that there should be more shows like that,that do not involve sex,nudity,stupid scenes,violence and etc.I just can't wait for season 3!The only bad thing about the upcoming season is the fact that Emma won't be there and she'll be replaced by the stupid Bella.Also,That show has some outstanding music.I love all Kate Alexa's No Ordinary Girl,which is played at the beginning of the episodes and Feel it Too,which is played at the episode when Kim and Eliott go on a date,it's good music.",2009

9,"First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying ""that was a stupid movie"". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.",2006

10,"You have to approach any movie adaptation of a video game with extreme trepidation. Think of the other corkers we've all caught on TV in the past: Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil. Stinkers, one and all. Doom was vapid, but at least got close to the source material.",2006
8,Horror? Try psychological triller and you might be closer to understanding why is it that I found Silent Hill such an amazing piece of work.,2006
10,"For everyone who has seen or is going to see or is thinking of seeing silent hill, do not go into it thinking ohhh its going to be a scary movie,,, because its not suppose to be. Its for intelligent drama based crowds who like good visuals, story line, acting, and mystery. This isn't doom and this isn't resident evil, this is a well written drama/mystery that happens to be very disturbing in its visual and story. People who have not played the game go see it with an open mind and not look at it as a video game movie because even without the game it could stand on its own as a great movie. So that said, if your looking for pop crap gore then don't see silent hill, if your looking for a memorable movie you well think about for years to come then do see silent hill. WELCOME TO SILENT HILL....",2006
10,"Agree 100% with agentmatheus: This is, hands down, the best VG adaption bar none! Seriously, it truly is like you are living the game. Granted, several characters have been changed, but that's to be expected. (Having a woman as the main protagonist, ensure's the main character is more vulnerable, than if it were a man). The set-pieces with the creatures are even more disturbing than their VG counterparts - I kid you not! The production design is truly superb and you get the feeling that Silent Hill really does exist. ",2006
9,Someone said worst movie ever- dude- ever see UltraViolet or Scary movie? Please easily those are the worst movies that should NEVER have been made.,2006
8,"Fans of the game will enjoy this film. Critics should be impressed with the set design, effects and cinematography; but I'm afraid most of them will miss the boat entirely. As far as a game to film translation, this is one of the best ever made.",2006
7,"I remember I sat down to play Silent Hill a couple of years ago because the mystery genre intrigued me and the game had an interesting look to it, so I started running through the abandoned town of 'Silent Hill' as the main player. I stopped playing very soon because, in truth, not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience, eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense build-up in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination, so I gave up. OK, fine - I was scared.",2006
8,"This movie was simply incredible. To all Silent Hill fans, I say, yes, PH was nothing more than a fanboy favorite and they changed the storyline a little from the first game, but I have never actually felt dread like I did in this movie when I heard the air-raid siren indicating that ""the darkness is coming"". I actually remember feeling the same dread while playing the game. The ending, while a bit of a letdown due to a lack of definite closure, was definitely very Silent-Hillesque in that it had a certain meaning that IS possible to find if you look closely enough into the clues.",2006
10,"This movie was amazing. Beginning to end it had me drawn in. This movie  breaks the rules and thinks outside the box...and gets away with it.  Maybe not a blockbuster, but definitely a cult classic :D To other  reviewers: Please, do a little research before you cut the movie off at  the knees. 1st off they're not Christian fanatics, they're another  cult. Secondly, not everything is movies are based on real things.  Certain things can be completely fictional. The movie was made to have  that dream/nightmare feel. It was an amazing movie if you actually paid  attention to it, and I'm sorry if your feeble mind cannot comprehend  what is going on. As for the part where they tell you the back-story,  it had nothing to do with anyone not knowing what was going on. Konami  as well as Sony loved it so much they didn't cut anything. That is why  the movie is so long. Not to mention this is a European FILM!!!!  Japanese horror, European writers and actors with few Americans (yeah  some of the actors were but they don't write the film). The movie is  supposed to make you sit back and go ""what the ****??"" when things  randomly happen...that's what Silent Hill is all about. This isn't your  run-of-the-mill horror ""horny teen"" slasher film (which unfortunately  is what's most popular in America). If you can, go to a matin√©e where  you can watch it without all of the people who think they're in MST3k  and all of the people who feel the need to talk to the screen. The  story is deep, really deep. The ending is tragic. And if you still  don't get it, it doesn't mean the movie sucked...it just means you  don't get it.",2006
7,"OK, I have just returned from seeing silent hill. Did I like it? Yes! Did I love it? HELL YES! ",2006
6,I've got mixed feelings towards this film. I've eagerly awaited it's release ever since it was first announced.,2006
8,"Wow. Silent Hill marks the return of well-written, well-acted, R-rated, balls-out, minimal use of CG horror. Did I mention it's R-rated? After months of PG-13 crap like Stay Alive, we finally got a movie that actually seems to stretch the limits of the R rating when it comes to gore. This movie drips and splatters blood. The use of CG is surprisingly low. Most creatures are really people in costumes, but it's so realistic yet strange that you almost think its CG. The movie is well-casted. Instead of, say Sarah Michelle Gellar they went on a limb and casted Radha Mitchell, who's biggest role so far has been in a minor Woody Allen movie. She carries the movie and does a fantastic job. They casted someone named Laurie Holden for the role of Cybil the cop, and she impressed me. Sean Bean as the husband is pretty much the only well-known actor in the movie, and he's basically a secondary character (though he does fine for his role).",2006
4,"If there was any video game-based movie I feel I had a stake in, it was Silent Hill. I'm a devoted fan of the games, having played all four multiple times each. I don't think I've ever had as spine-chillingly memorable a time doing anything related to the horror genre as I've had playing those games. After the crushing disappointment of the Resident Evil movies, I had cautious optimism about Silent Hill. Early interviews with director Christophe Gans seemed to point to a guy passionate about the material and determined to do right by it.",2006
8,"I have been a fan of the first game since it came out. As with most video game adaptations, I expected this to be a piece of sh#@. Instead, I got an atmospheric, haunting thriller that slowly creeps into you and doesn't let go.",2006
8,You might learn that this supernatural thriller comes from a video game but don't let it stop you from watching it. It's an adaptation that's actually decent and that works very well as a serious horror film. How did they manage that rare feat? It might be because they hired a talented french director (he did Brotherhood of the Wolf which you should see) who loved the original material and actually found it frightening (which it is). He even had to woo the notoriously protective Japanese producers (Konami) for years to be accepted. The guy was dedicated and he shoots some hellishly beautiful scenes. It might be because the story is engrossing and mysterious. It might be because the mostly unknown actresses (mostly a female cast in the major roles) play it very well and seriously.,2009
3,"Oh, please, viewer... Won't you please see me as a deep and creative filmmaker? ",2007
10,"Silent Hill came in with big expectations from video game fans, and horror fans alike. Knowing what I do about ""game based films"" usually tending to be sub-par, I was very impressed when Silent Hill not only met my standards for a great horror film, but also surpassed them.",2006
7,"Silent Hill is far from a perfect movie. But, Silent Hill is also one of the best video game to movie adaptations out there. That's really not saying much. If you were to watch this movie without playing the games, you might as well bring your pillow. Fortunately for me, I've played all 4 games in the series multiple times, and it was for people like me that the movie was made in the first place. The plot of the movie steals familiar elements from the games. But, it doesn't tie into the games. They combined the plots of the first two games, changed the focus around, and ultimately steered away from the MUCH darker and much more confusing plot of the games. The fans will either be smiling with glee or reliving their darkest nightmares as the movie tosses fans a lot of bones. There are EXACT shots recreated on the silver screen that were used in the games. Multiple times I THOUGHT I knew the direction in which the movie was going, because it was so familiar, and then they'd go in a completely different direction. It was actually irritating at first, but once I got over that, I just enjoyed it for what it was. Do NOT expect to watch ""Resident Evil"" with this movie. While they may share similar genres, that's where the comparisons end. MUCH like the game, the movie is slow, and it's scares rely on a creepy, skin-crawling feeling rather than ""jump"" scares. But, the acting is actually what impressed me. Some may see it as annoying, but those that played the game, will actually feel like they pulled dialogue directly out of it. And, Radha Mitchell does a good job acting like a frantic mother searching for her child. I will admit though, at times I wanted to pull my hair out in frustration because her character actually hardly does anything. She just runs around, chasing after a little girl that she thinks is her daughter. Did no one learn anything from Event Horizon? If they run AWAY from you, they are playing a game with you. Apart from minor annoyances with her character, the other characters were bland and flat, but hey, you can't have an ""R"" rated horror movie without a high corpse count. Although they did take the ""survival horror"" to the extreme with the survival part. It would've been nice to see some of the violence directed at the creatures. C'mon, you beat them senseless with lead pipes in the game, but that was lacking. Sean Bean could've helped make the movie all that more stellar, but he's kind of a side-plot. Without giving too much away, there's some closure to the movie, but it would be naive to say they wouldn't make a sequel starring Sean Bean, unless, of course, he was only a ""draw"" to bring more to the movie. The cinematography and camera angles steal from the game, but they are effective and well done. The sound was superb, with many sound bytes from the games, and a lot of eerie effects for the creatures. The gore was a little over the top, and like mentioned earlier, needed to be directed more at the creatures. All in all, the movie felt like a throwback to the games, putting in as many elements that made ""sense"" with the movies plot, to make the fans happy. Those unfamiliar with the series, MAY appreciate it for what it is. Basically this- it's a creepy and gory distraction, that's pretty boring as is, but given that it's based off of a video game that's just a creepy and gory distraction, that's pretty boring as well, they're a perfect match. Just remember that it's probably the best video game-to-movie adaptation out there (need I bring up Uwe Boll?), but leaves it's fans wanting more. Thankfully, the movie industry milks licenses for all they're worth, and we'll probably see a sequel sometime in the future.",2006
8,"I don't play video games, so I went into this film with no pre-conceived notions or expectations. I came away pretty impressed and a little disturbed.",2006
4,"The title says it all : - the ""spooky"" moments (when darkness falls) are sort of cool visually but not creepy (to my mind). I never played the game but I suppose some of the gory stuff shows in the game (like bloody characters - or parts of them - hanging from barbwire and stuff, the big demon itself with its funny box hiding its head, and its huge sword are typical of a video game). The small distorted creatures are quite nightmarish. The change of reality is also successful I think. Also, when Rose is going down the pit to face the source of evil, I could definitely feel video gaming there. The screwed up nurses were a bit funny (but not spooky) ... ",2006
2,"A two you might be asking yourself right now. Yeah, that's right. The ONLY reason why this movie got a two out of me was because I was impressed by the creature and setting designs. The transforming of Foggy Silent Hill into Nightmare Silent Hill was definitely a visual I would've loved to have seen in the game series. Also, the creature representation was excellent as well right down to their movements, and of course, freaking Pyramid Head. I loved that guy...monster...thing...I give up. But that's about it. In dead on terms my opinion of this movie was mostly bad, a little good, and a lot that was bad but was inevitable in the movie adaptation. Stop reading now if you gave this movie higher than a 5.",2006

I thought that my mother and I liked it more than my niece did, I'm not sure if that was because we could relate to the moral of the story but I know she laughed a lot louder than we did at times. But we all laughed. The crowd was mostly teens. Compared to other movies out this summer I think it is worth paying the day or night rate. I would actually go see it again.",2006
1,"I was forced to see this atrocity with my gay roommate, only because he thought the guy playing John Tucker was hot. Thank god it was on HBO and not for rent; this wasn't even worth ten cents. I pity today's teenagers that have to endure crap like this. All the actors looked a decade older than teenagers, the plain-jane Kate looked a lot prettier than the mean chicks out for revenge (how this girl is seen as ""invisible"" is beyond me), Jenny McCarthy still can't act (isn't her 15 minutes up yet???), and the whole revenge storyline was just plain boring. If they had concentrated on the Kate-having-a-crush-on-John-Tucker's-older-brother storyline and have them hook up in the end, the movie would've been way more interesting. Instead, we had revenge by thongs, estrogen pills, ""invisible"" Kate playing hard to get. So where's the ""killing"" part? If you're going to call your film JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE, shouldn't SOMEONE kick the bucket? What a ripoff! Save your money...and your sanity.",2007
9,"When I first saw the previews for this film I thought it looked funny, but shallow..and a little trashy. However, after I saw the film I was surprised to find the film uplifting, with some depth , and good actors. Ashanti,Bush,and Kebbel blend together well as they team up against Tucker. Each of their personalities contribute to this film in a special way. Snow (the lead character) was what made the film. She truly lit up the screen.Actors aside the movie as a whole was enjoyable and exciting. This movie maybe was not the most spectacular movie created. But it was fun and worth spending a few bucks to see.",2006

We were not sure if we'd like it, we thought that it was more for a teenage crowd. We found ourselves laughing out loud throughout the movie and came out thoroughly satisfied with this movie. It was definitely worth seeing and I didn't feel ripped off paying the night-time price. The pranks are hilarious in this film. If you want a good laugh I recommend this movie. Men running around in thong underwear, ""it's like having your best friend in a silk hammock"". The comments are really fun in this movie.",2006

8,"Today it was 100 degrees in New York City and frankly I went more for the air conditioning than the content, but this movie was much better than the trailer or the critics give it credit for. As solid as ""Bring it On,"" it is definitely a notch above the average teen comedy; not quite ""Mean Girls"" but a good substitute. The girls are all terrific and Jesse Metcafe struts his acting and physique to an even higher standard than what he demonstrated on Desperate Housewives.",2006
7,"...But, Jesse Metcalfe is still hot. Shame about his limited acting ability though, as the infamous John Tucker was simply a more confident version of his ""Desperate Housewives"" character John Rowland, but nevertheless, Metcalfe seems to enjoy his characters, and certainly makes them come to life.

3,"Its the typical teenager movie. Unpopular girl becomes popular, snobby girls become unpopular girls friend just to crush the unpopular girl in the end leading to the feel good fairytale ending! PLEASE spare me! I honestly wasn't totally turned off while watching it, there were some funny parts I could laugh at and the story moved pretty quick. But there were some parts that were really unrealistic. First of all the fact that a girl like Kate(Brittany Snow) didn't have any friends was pretty phony! The fact that the head cheerleader HAS to date the basketball captain is just so clich√©. The thing that I really couldn't get past was the stupid Boom Mic!!! It was in so many scenes it was almost laughable. Who ever edited this movie might be in the wrong career! If I was staring in this movie I would have been humiliated at the premier!",2006

So, I expected the worst possible thing. Now it wasn't the worst possible thing and so that is why I think I didn't mind it very much. That is not to say it is that great. If you are expecting something AMAZING, it's not. It's just a pointless chick flick, reusing familiar jokes over and over. Some of these jokes were funny, but very old and worn out.

But when the girlfriends discover each others existence, they bring in Kate to help take down John Tucker. . This movie is a great date for your high school sweetheart.

I would have to say this movie is more for females than males. But then again if a guy wanted to see some pretty nice looking girls they just might like it. Plus it might give them some insight as to how a girl gets even. LOL. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because I can't say it was the ""Best"" movie I've ever seen.

It is amazing that something so clich√©, so terribly acted, with such a terrible story line and stupid stupid dialogue could ever be approved of by others! I see comparisons to Mean Girls, that movie was actually good and pretty well acted. That movie was at least interesting. This movie blatantly tried to copy Mean Girls in certain parts. The girls are the worst actors I have ever seen. This should have been a B-movie of National Lampoons except it doesn't have any nudity and the girls aren't' attractive. Usually I like Teen Movies with stupid humor, but I wish I had my money back. I wish I had those awful two hours back. I wish. But, like ""A Perfect Storm"", I will never be given that time back in my life so I hope that this comment dissuades people from seeing this movie and wasting their time.

You get the message but if you're into watching tasteless filth or if you just want to see some hot girls than this film is for you. This movie even makes The Fifth Element a good movie to watch & everybody knows The Fifth Element sucked. I personally can't see why anybody would want to waste their time & money seeing this God-Awful movie. What also adds to the useless crap in the movie is there is a Food Fight scene in the last part in the film which is ridiculous & is not needed for a movie that already sucks from the get-go.

The ingenious plot is a basketball player John Tucker who has three women, who find out that they are not his only true love. In spite of his acts they take vengeance on him by trying to humiliate him and all out kill him. These girls are so stupid to fall for this loser, and Tucker himself brings nothing new to the table.

Some might be let down by Sophia Bush's role in this movie, although she did have some good moments. Ashanti wasn't half bad in her head-cheerleader role, Arielle Kebbel was okay (didn't have enough good lines though), and Jesse Metcalfe was truly born to play John Tucker.

As I was walking out of the theatre, i decided that the movie could have all been worth it if the makers took a small chance and changed one part of the script. (for the record, these ideas look awful in writing) As the movie is being summed up, and we learn that John Tucker never lied again, they should have also explained that he was also coming out of the closet. The other idea would to have Kate dump John for his little brother, but when she asks the brother out, he reveals that HE is gay.

1,I absolutely hated this movie. It was the worst movie Ever made. heres 5 reasons why I hated this movie.,2008
10,"I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. ""Click"" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in ""Click"" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book.",2006
8,Going in to this movie I expected to have the normal 2 hour thoughtless escape from everyday life that these type movies normally deliver. Instead I laughed. I even cried. I left pleasantly surprised. Leaving the theatre I couldn't help reflect upon the need to really appreciate life's little moments and close friends and family more. Walken was outstanding. Sandler was effective and really funny in his toned down approach to this more intelligent comedy than the usual Sandler fare. Kate Beckinsale is very lovable as the wife and mother of his children and Hasslehoff couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the cluelessly self-absorbed exec/ boss. I liked it a lot and I'm not normally one to feel either way about these type of movies. I'd go see it next time with family and friends that I really should spend more time with anyway!,2006
10,"Being an Adam Sandler film I went into the preview expecting the same Adam Sander film which I do enjoy quite a lot, sometimes it's great to escape and not get too critical about the film you are viewing. I went in with this mentality to Click and I was surprised with how good this film really is. A lot of the time people that write comments will judge a film without seeing it and it gives the film a bad name. Ignore what you hear about this film and take a look, I'm sure you will be surprised with it also. Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film, Click is no different, Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film, in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on Foxtel/Austar.",2006
10,"I have to say I did not expect to enjoy this movie. My son wanted to see it and finally I gave in & said yes. I thought I was going to have to sit through an hour & a half of mindless comedy. WRONG! This movie did not have a slow moment. There were plenty of laughs for all ages. The 10 yr olds with me didn't get the meaning behind the movie but enjoyed every moment of it. When the movie was over people clapped and were saying that was a great movie. You really must see it! I think a movie that keeps the attention of children and adults is absolutely worth seeing. Although it was full of laughs, keep a napkin handy for a few moments of tears.....",2006
9,"What a pleasant surprise ""Click"" turned out to be! Based on the trailer, one can assume that Adam Sandler, playing Michael Newman in his latest movie, has made a movie that is just like Adam Sandler's last movie... and Adam Sandler's movie before that... and the one before that... i.e., the comedy at which you groan, shake your head, say ""what the..."", and yet can't help from laughing out loud. That's what you get in the first hour of this film. That hour is also as much as the trailer shows, and for good reason.",2006
8,"This movie surprised us. We cried. Yes, we cried. The trailer barely tells you what the movie is about. There were some unfunny dumb things having to do with dogs, etc. (no one in the theater laughed much) and some cheeseball stuff, but the emotional core of the movie delivers a wallop that is unexpected. Along the lines of a sort of combination of ""Family Man"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- more ""Family Man"" -- this movie didn't just bring tears to eyes, it makes you cry. Because of that, I liked it and give it a thumbs up. The annoying stuff is a relatively small price to pay for the lessons the core stuff teaches. Lastly, Kate Beckinsdale (the epitome of domestic beauty in this movie) is absolutely a dream and the actress that played her grown daughter had eyes that matched -- well done. Enough said.",2006

My only complaint is that it certainly isn't ""family fare"" for a nice story and should have been rated ""R,"" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.",2006
8,"Where did the old Adam Sandler go? I'm not complaining mind you. I never really liked the fire breathing, short-fused Sandler and it seems that with every new movie I like him even more.",2006
10,"This movie is very entertaining, and will make you think long and hard about your own life for many hours after you leave the theater. I was expecting a slapstick comedy, and ended up shedding some tears. This movie sends lots of messages about life, and teaches us all a very good lesson. I also loved the soundtrack, lots of great older songs used throughout the film. I left the theater, and drove to Best Buy to purchase the soundtrack, but was disappointed to learn there was not one! Bottomline, GO see this movie, you will NOT be disappointed! Two thumbs way...............up! I took my 10 year son, and he loved it as well, however, some of the humor is a bit crude, and may be offensive to some younger children. For example, there is lots of ""dog humping"" shown throughout the movie. But it's the message the movie sends that's the most beneficial. It will truly make you ""think""............",2006
8,"The architect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) has a typical middle-class family with his lovely and gorgeous wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and their son Ben and daughter Samantha, and a constant visit of his parents. However, Michael is workaholic and under stress, trying to satisfy his boss with overwork and get a partnership in his company, giving priority to his work and neglecting the family issues. When the tired Michael goes to a department store to buy an universal remote control, he rests on a bed and he meets the weird salesman Morty (Christopher Walken) that offers him a remote control capable of controlling his own universe. Michael uses too much and loses the control of the device, having his own life controlled by the remote control. Then Michael sees the worthwhile parts of his personal life he missed while working, and in the end of his life he lately concludes that the family comes first.",2007
1,"The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was. From ""Faust"" to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" The what if, the second chance, the realization and all the rest. So, can anyone explain to me why the new moronic turns of this perennial tale. The Jerry Springer sensibility that corrodes, diminishes and ultimate destroys what it should have been a lovely movie is what I took with me as I rushed out of the theater. I think that we should all know by now that technical wizardry is not nearly enough and that audiences are smarter than what the smart ass marketing experts seem to think. Is this movie making money? I don't know but I don't think so not even with a million copy opening week end. How sad really. How sad.",2006
10,"Click was a movie that words cannot even describe how AWESOME it was.From Beginning to the end you'll laugh and you'll cry.I know all of us want to have be financially successful,have that position etc but let me tell you one thing I've learned from this movie FAMILY comes first.No matter how good of a job it sounds or how much it pays off if it takes away from time with your families its NOT worth it because none of us are promised tomorrow and cherish every moment every second you have with them.Parents enjoy the time you have with your kids no matter how young or old they are.Because you won't be able to make up for the times you've missed.Even if you have missed time it's never too late to start.Time is so precious and goes by too fast But I would not recommend this to younger children under 10.It does have some scenes that are not appropriate for them to see.But I do recommend this incredible movie to teens,parents,and grandparents.This is a life-changing movie that will make a difference in your life as well as your families.Don't miss your chance.This film will change your life forever and the way you look at life.Life is too short to miss out on the things that are really important and matter most.Lastly this movie has opened my heart and reminded me of is to tell your family (husbands,wives,kids,brothers,sisters,mom's and dads) you love them everyday and always make time for them.",2006
1,"It first starts like a comedy it turns into a ""drama"" and then it ends like a comedy again.Why couldn't simply end with the death of Sandler? Why we had to see this typical happy ending again? In this movie there are a lot of clich√©s. Is the typical story of a man who finds something that change his life,he doesn't like it, tries to have his old life back and when a dead end appears...how original he wakes up from his sleep!!!",2006
7,"Michael Newman loves his family. But he wants to be promoted no matter what, since in this way he could spend more time with his wife, Donna, and Ben and Samantha, his kids. One day,he argues with Donna that he could not stay with his family in an important camp day, and goes out, angry, to buy a universal remote control, since he always had problems with the amount of remote controls they had in their house. He then meets Morty, a strange man and inventor that gives him a one-of-a-kind universal remote control, that cannot be returned. Michael finds out that the remote is literally universal: it controls the universe, and interprets his wishes,altering time and reality, as well as he can ''forward'' things he doesn't want to wait and ''pause'' others. Michael starts using the remote in his way, and discovers that he boss waits forever to give him a promotion, while making him spend more and more time with work each time. The time passes very quick, and the remote is automatically programmed (by his usage of it) to skip or fast-forward many important things of Michael's life. When he sees the thing is out of control, he tries to destroy the remote, but it doesn't work.",2007
1,"This film was not funny in the slightest. It was crude, I refuse to believe that anybody encourages their dogs to behave so. It was a mishmash of styles. There was sentimentality, crudity and complete illogicality.",2007
1,"i guess it was time for Adam sandler to try a heart-warming family comedy. i really didn't want to see this, because i end up hating almost anything Adam sandler does. he always seems to be doing the ""waterboy"" voice, even when he isn't trying to. i gave him some slack because i enjoyed ""punch-drunk love"", a movie where he actually seemed to stretch a bit as an actor and try to make you forget for a few moments that it's him on screen. well, back to the same old garbage here. he surrounds himself with an excellent supporting cast (including Christopher walken, Kate beckinsale and even Jennifer Connelly), but to no avail. it's a story about a busy family man given a ""universal"" remote that allows him to access all parts of his life, including fast-forwarding through the parts he doesn't like (and accessing the commentary track, done by James earl Jones). of course, it spirals out of control. It's an interesting premise. with a different actor, one more capable of pulling the audience in, it would have been spot-on. instead, with him, it came off as syrupy, trite and heavy-handed, eliciting no audience empathy at all. to me, sandler seems to have a smirking, sleepwalking quality to his performances, like we're both in on some joke. i never bought him as a father, a husband or an architect. boo!",2008
5,"Too bad the movie isn't that original. Throughout the movie, I kept trying to remember where I had read a similar storyline but it kept evading me. Then, recently, my daughter picked up her R.L. Stine book called ""30 Tales to Give You Goosebumps"" and announced that there is a short story in it called ""Click"". She read it to me (I read it to her sometime ago first) and both of us were amazed at the similarities. In Stine's ""Click"" story there is a kid named Seth Gold whose dad (not surprisingly) brings home a universal remote that allows him to replay, fast forward, mute and slow mo' real life at his home, school and with his friends. I actually found R.L. Stine's ""Click"" to be more amusing than the movie, but then again, Goosebumps movies are pretty darn scary - even if they ARE supposed to be just for kids!!!",2006
5,We've seen this movie way too many times...,2006

2,"This movie had some humor but I feel the generic family stuff overrode it. And the generic family plot wasn't even that good or interesting. It was barely developed throughout the movie. In bits and pieces it was but throughout, no.",2006
8,"this movie is comedy(and pretty good),drama(not often but really emotional) and fantastic(with one of the best superpower). I think everyone wants to have power like Adam has in this film,because you can do anything any'time',it is good and bad at the same time,so it makes movie better to watch.plus Adam Sandler acts quite good in comedy and in drama part too and it's one of the best hes films.this movie will make you think about that everything has good and bad side.this is great movie for all kind of people,so you can watch it with whole family.",2016
1,"Harried workaholic Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is given a ""universal"" remote control, by Morty (Christopher Walken) that allows him to (1) REWIND time, (2) JUMP FORWARD in time, (3) SUSPEND time altogether. Unfortunately, the audience is given no such device that might blessedly allow it to SUSPEND its strained credulity, which screen writers Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe tax beyond all tolerable limits.",2007
1,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It pretends to be a comedy movie, but in reality it's the most depressing and disturbing thing I've ever seen. The whole premise is that Adam Sandler is tricked into thinking his life can be improved, and this ""improvement"" causes his life to shoot forward in time to when he has cancer, when his wife leaves him, and then to his death. You see him die, and it is disturbing.",2007
8,I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.,2006
9,"I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I laughed SO hard -- literal out loud, deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. Granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. The actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.",2006
8,"I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching She's the Man. Despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie.",2006
9,"She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type ""chick flick"" films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my all time faves) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, ""Three's Company"" style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.",2006
6,"Now I would just like to say that I love this movie for what it is. Namely, a smart and hilarious teen flick that is at its best when its staying with ""the funny"", and completely sappy and or cheesy when it attempts anything else. ""She's the Man"" had solid comedic acting from Amanda. She has really grown as a comedian, and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. The film also had enough pretty people to make the setting nothing like any normal person's high school. I don't know else I can say other than this movie made me laugh way too loud, even for a movie theater, and I had to stifle my chocking laughter numerous times with my coat. i highly recommend this movie to anyone in need of a few laughs and some mindless dialog",2006
10,"I got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in Brea and I have been crazy for it ever since. The film is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night which I have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so I certainly liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not it won't matter - the movie stands on it's on. It is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and so was David Cross. Actually the whole cast is great - I just happen to be a huge David Cross fanatic. The cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few I hadn't heard before but I know they have a CD coming out so I will definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!",2006
6,"Though I hate to admit it, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have scored again. ""She's the Man"" is a ridiculous but ultimately entertaining teen movie which takes the gender-bending action of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" and drops it in the middle of a modern-day American boarding school. The premise should sound familiar because screenwriters Lutz and Smith also penned ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" another twist on Shakespeare, starring the likes of Julia Styles and Academy Award nominee Heath Ledger (before he was an Academy Award nominee).",2006
10,"I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Sure there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me up. I thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good in acting out this comedy. I have to give kudos to Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were funny as well. Of course there were moments where you yell at the screen ""how can you not tell?"", but that's all part of the fun. In the end the plot turned out pretty well. There's a happy ending, but what'd you expect. ",2006
9,"This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. The strong superstructure of its plot is upheld by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present. And, so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are used to good effect in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes. And the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming coming of age movie.",2006
9,"This movie is a great movie, however it is, as most movie highly predictable. The greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. She is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the most strangest and gut-busting faces ever made. It's good for the kids, and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. All in all, they did a good job updating an old classic, and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with O and 10 Things I Hate About You. The other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debuts.",2006
9,"I saw this film at a special screening. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The movie is based on the Shakespeares book ""The Twelth Night"" This movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer. Well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school. On her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love, lies, and deception. This movie is this years Mean Girls. I think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie.",2006
8,"At first, I honestly thought it would be a corny movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast (Especially that character played by ""Bullet tooth Tony"" from Snatch. What a contrasting role between those two movies!). Now, i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not, but her act, especially, was thoroughly enjoyable. Even though the plot devolved into a teeny-bopper love triangle (though very funny) half-way into the movie, I feel that this shouldn't discount, what I think, the movie really is: simply entertaining. So if you happen to stumble upon it, whether by DVD or theater, i'm confident that you'll enjoy.",2006
2,"I went into this film not expecting much, so in that respect, I wasn't disappointed, but even then, I can't believe how dire this film really is. Amanda Bynes as the cross-dressing Viola/Sebastian takes every opportunity to mug for the camera, and reinforce the gender stereotypes that always plague such teen comedies. It's so full of over-exaggerated types, that it seems like the filmmakers took a teen comedy proforma and just ticked the boxes: spunky/pretty/feisty girl? Check. Spunky but dumb athletic jock boy? Check. Ditzy frou-frou mom? Check. Gay best friend/hairdresser needed for makeover? Check. Beautiful but unattainable girl who really is shy? Check. I could go on. What's most disappointing is that this film had a real chance to say something, albeit through comedy, about gender roles, cross-dressing and even sexual attraction, but backed away quickly whenever it got close. The concept of same-sex attraction isn't explored at all in the film: when Duke finds himself attracted to 'Sebastian'; he just says it'd be 'weird'. I'm just giving it 2: one for the all the scenes where Channing Tatum and his hot friends are topless, and one because you can't really muck up Shakespeare that much.",2006
6,"Viola Johnson (Amanda Bynes) enters a prestigious boarding school disguised as her brother, so that he can run off to London to become a musician. Unfortunately, she immediately falls for her male roommate, who already has a crush on a girl who now has a crush on the male version of Viola.",2006
6,"When the Cornwall school cancels the women's soccer team, the player Viola (Amanda Bynes) is absolutely disappointed since the sport is her passion. Then her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) skips class to travel to London to play his songs and Viola disguises herself as if she was Sebastian to join the Illirya soccer team. Viola falls in love for her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) that has a crush on Olivia Lennox (Laura Ramsey) that feels attracted by the sensitive Sebastian (indeed Viola) that is chased by his girlfriend Monique (Alex Breckenridge). Out of the blue, the real Sebastian anticipates his return from London and he is not aware of the situation and has to play soccer game against Cornwall.",2010
3,"On a flight back from London, I watched She's the Man; apparently Air Canada has a crap movie policy. Perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. Even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian David Cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). The ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. I guess if I was a 12-year-old girl, I might have really enjoyed this one.",2006
10,"This movie is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her quest to beat her school Cornwell boys team after they kicked the girls team out. So she goes to the rival school Illaria and joins the boys team, in doing so she falls for Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks shes a guy and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Viola as a her brother. ",2006
3,"My girlfriend talked me into renting She's the Man and I will never forgive her for subjecting me to the horror that was this ""film"". The only slightly intriguing aspect was the idea of Amanda Bynes dressed as a boy. Sadly, even that was not enough to pull it off. Admittedly, there were some entertaining lines and I may have laughed out loud once or twice but the painful moments and pathetic, repeated attempts at humor (during Amanda's attempts at faking masculinity) just made me wince and shake my head. If you've recently been subjected to a lobotomy and have lost all sense of what entertainment is, this is the film for you.",2006
7,"Finally! A good just have fun movie. I saw this movie at a Promo and it is hilarious! Though the acting is a little eh, and the plot is ridiculous and it obvious that she is a woman it is funny and enjoyable with some GOOD material.",2006
3,"This movie sucked. It made me long for Garfield the Movie. I sat through Gigli mildly entertained, yet I wouldn't wish this on Sadam. Its almost as if Amanda Bynes has a King Midas-like ability to turn everything she touches into refuse. So if you're looking for a good movie, or even just a movie that is not too funny but at least somewhat entertaining, then go see Ice Age II. Otherwise just save yourself the nine dollars I paid to Muvico Cinemas and stare at your watch for two hours because that's what you're going to end up doing if you go to see ""She's the Man. For further reasoning on why this modern day adaptation of Twelfth Night sucked, here is the review i'm turning in to my English teacher who forced me to sit through this wretched abortion. ",2006
9,"I thought this movie was so funny! I loved how it was set into a teens life and I loved the actors. As well as funny, I thought it really did have a lot of meaning to it and I would see it over and over again! Viola is twin sister to her brother, Sebastian. Viola loves to play soccer but, her girls soccer team get's cut because not enough girls signed up, the boy's team won't let her in because they think she's not good enough. Turns out, Sebastian is going to skip school for 2 weeks to go to London for a band concert which he so passionately loves, but what is he going to do about school? Viola is there to help, she disguises herself as her twin brother, Sebastian, she then goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team so she can prove that she is a great soccer player just like any other guy!",2006
10,"Ignoring the fact that the movie is unrealistic and a little cheesy, you will love it! I was already a big Amanda Bynes fan, but this movie definitely made me like her even more. If you enjoy subtle or dry humor, she may not be the comedian for you, but she pulls off over the top humor like that of Jim Carey, Lucille Balle, and Mary Tyler Moore. You may know some predictable jokes are forth coming, but you will be surprised at how they are pulled off and what original jokes are presented. If you are quick to judge a movie, i have to warn you that the first 20 minutes have all the qualities of a straight to television tween movie, but as the plot thickens so does the movie and humor. As you watch the movie, you can actually feel the awkwardness that develops as Amanda Bynes character ""Sebastian"" begins to fall for her male roommate. The humor within the background characters such as Eunice, Malcolm, and Principal Gold is down right silly, but in a hilarious way that makes them stand out. She's the Man won't be winning any Oscars, but that didn't stop me from buying it on DVD the day it was released. It has become my favorite comedy without using the obscenity that Will Ferrel, Ben Stiller and others like them often need to make their movies funny. With the exception of sexual innuendos, it is a fun movie that i think your entire family can enjoy!",2006
10,"While on spring break my mom, dad, 9 year old brother and I went to see She's the Man. Being a teenage girl I could not wait for this movie for many reasons. Reason 1: Amanda Bynes is my hero. 2: It has soccer in it. 3: Looks really funny 4: Boarding School 5: Guys soccer 6: Channing Tatum with out a shirt. Typical, but very good reasons. We got to the theater and of course my dad was being grumpy and complaining about the previews and how we wouldn't be out of the movie until after dinner. Continuing with his current mood, 25 minutes into the movie my dad turned to the rest of us and said, ""You guys owe me big time."" But, he was laughing so hard sometimes that he was slapping the arm rest in the theater. If this movie can make a 45 year old man laugh it's way worth seeing.",2006
7,"Just returned from a screening of She's the man. It's not a cinematic masterpiece. There is no nudity whatsoever. No swearing whatsoever. But still a solid production with strong comic performances from the leads, especially Bynes. The writers are Karen Lutz and Kristen Smith who also wrote ""Legally Blonde"" and ""10 things I hate about you"" Expect the same theatrical set up/punchline/soundtrack dominated flick with more ""Series of Shots"" plot development montages than most people care to see. The dozens of 16 year old girls at the screening (""I told you at lunch that I was gonna sit with Amanda. Cause remember during study hall when that cute Senior was walking by and Amanda asked me first if I would sit with her? Remember?) all loved this movie. I have watched Legally Blonde numerous times on cross country flights and it never fails to disappoint me. Mainly because Reese Witherspoon is despicable and one dimensional. She is easy to hate. Amanda Bynes is a piece of work. Impossible to dislike. She reminds me of Lucile Ball and Ellen Degeneres with a natural sense of timing and uninhibited range of expression. Bynes is adorable. These types of comedies live or die on how memorable the cast is. If the performances are wooden such as in 10 Things I Hate About You, the film fades into dust. She's the Man is a fine effort. I found myself laughing at regular intervals. That wasn't true with Mean Girls because the performances in Mean Girls were not convincing. They seemed too rehearsed. The cast of She's the Man is theatrical to a fault, but the situation demands it. Their performances come across as improvised and authentic. They are going for laughs and mostly get them. I can't see how anyone under 20 would not like this movie. Anyone over 20 should see it if they like teen comedies with clever situations.",2006
8,"This movie was really great! I went with my boyfriend (we are both 20) and he loved it just as much as I did. Amanda bynes who if you don't follow her work has been working since she was very young and got her big break on nickelodeon. Now Amanda stars in the WB comedy series ""What I like About You"". Amanda is hysterically funny in this movie, as is the rest of the cast. The way she depicts a teenage ""all-american"" guy is right on target! I would def take your tweens/teens to see this, and parents would have a great laugh too! I feel they got the teen life right on target...usually in teen comedy roles are extremely EXAGGERATED! Def worth the 10$$",2006
10,"If you have ill feelings about this movie because of its straight-to-video status then put those feelings aside and you'll be treated to a fun movie. This sequel succeeds where ""Bring It On Again"" miserably failed (and let me tell you, that movie failed BIG TIME!). Unlike the previous entry, this third installment gets everything right with a likable & appealing cast, killer dance routines, a terrific soundtrack, good story and better production values (most likely thanks to product tie-ins from Cingular, Teen People and Volks Wagon). While it doesn't top the original, it still comes close as a worthy companion. The film borrows the same basic premise as the original: pompous upper-class cheer squad (this time the Pacific Vista Pirates) vs urban middle-class cheer squad (Crenshaw Heights Warriors). But thanks to a new twist involving the former captain of the Pacific Vista team having to transfer to Crenshaw Heights and join their squad, the film focuses more on the racially diversified Crenshaw Heights Warriors and their point-of-view. Much credit is due to writer Alyson Fouse, a former writer for Chris Rock and Keenan Ivory Wayans, and director Steve Rash who both do an admirable job of going back to what made the first film so great without making it seem like they're trying to do the exact same movie over again. The cast, although made up of young unknowns, should also be complimented for bringing the right amount of spark and attitude to their characters so that you can't help but like them, no matter how stereotypical some of them may be. Which is more than can be said about the charmless, bland wannabes from the second film. Going through the DVD's bonus features, you'll be able to tell that the cast and filmmakers worked hard to make this movie live up to the original by having the cast go through rigorous training at cheerleader camp as well as hiring a variety of talented and innovative choreographers to come up with some unique and dazzling routines. So, put all prejudices aside, wash the awful taste of ""Bring It On Again"" out of your mouth, and give this fun addition to the franchise a shot.",2006
6,"First, I will say I enjoyed the first movie, thought it was well done and entertaining. The second movie, in my opinion, was pretty poor, it just tried too hard and didn't flow at all.",2006
10,"At first I thought the movie wasn't going to be any good. For the same reason a lot of people had. It is a third sequel with none of the same people in it. But to my surprise it was really funny. The mix of urban street and high class attitudes was excellent. I thought the movie also showed both sides to the racial prejudice that we in the United States still face. They did not show a one side issue with upper class whites downgrading the minorities. They went on to show that the minority groups also have stereotypical attitudes about whites or people who live in the upper class of society. The ending was the best it had a dance challenged at the end that rocked the cheers were out of this world the audience were on their feet and filled the theater with laughter the whole movie. It was great, the kids love it. Get it when it comes out you will not be disappointed. Great family movie with parental guidance not for younger children but the preteens will enjoy",2006
9,"So I loved Bring it On, then Bring it On again or 2...sucked now this movie rocked my world. Maybe good movies are hereditary and skip a generation...who knows, but All or Nothing is freaking amazing! don't judge, just watch. I am not a fan of Hayden but she proves herself in this movie breaking the boundaries of what I had her pinned for. There are great characters, some hilarious moments and everything a good bring it on film needs. Although it may lack the star power of the first movie these kids hold their own. With a fun soundtrack and some great dance moves everyone can learn something from this movie. If you want a grooving movie this one is for you!",2006
8,"the writing in this script is excellent, almost as good as Clueless, except for the fact that it has to keep to a predictable ""Cheerleader"" story line, but the dialogue between the characters is sharp, crisp and witty. The direction is also excellent, the cheer/dance numbers are great and the cast, while not matching the teen star power of the original, bring a lot of energy and commitment to their roles. this is a very, very likable teen movie. The extras on the DVD are entertaining but it would have been nice to hear from some of the actors and the gag reel as usual on most DVDs is far from funny. but they did put in a lot about the dancing which is enjoyable.",2006
8,"This movie was really good. A bit racist, a bit rude but very funny, with a great storyline and a good cast. One problem- why do the teenagers look older than the adults? Mostly talking about Winnie- she looks about 30! But it really was a good film. I'd recommend it for all girls 12-17. Even if you don't like cheer-leading! Plus the IM language was cool. And the music was v. gd as well. The beginning worried me a bit cause I thought I might be in for another dodgy high-school-musical type thing, but it was just a dream! Phew! Winnie was just such a bitch, but I was surprised to find out she was the only one, most movies make the cheerleaders seem like nasty snobby girls, so this was a change. A great film, see it!",2007
10,Bring It On All Or Nothing was one of the best movies that i have seen this year as pure entertainment and as a movie to watch with family This movie to me was better than the first two and it included a lot of new cheers and moves. It also showed more than just cheer-leading which is what made it better it showed the difference between your friends and who you think are your friends but really just want what you have. The storyline was terrific and so was the music. Solange played her role excellently and couldn't have been better. Rhianna was excellent as well and the video part at the end was excellent i can watch this movie over and over and over again. SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE THAN YOU SHOULD IT IS GREAT!!!!!,2006
6,This movie to me was better than the other Bring It On movies. This was worth watching; not saying that the other ones wasn't worth watching I'm saying that the third one was the most interesting. I really like that movie. I wonder what they gonna do in the next movie. I hope they make it with little kids in it so that they can influence little kids to cheerleaders when they get in school. I wonder if most of the people in part three gonna be in part four. i hope they do because Solange will be a great coach for the little kids. I really enjoy watching that movie it was so exciting and interesting. I watched this movie over and over; this movie has not got boring yet. Nice movie.,2006
10,"I just got through watching this movie and thought it was absolutely fantastic. Although the others were cute and witty, this Bring it on, brought more to the screen. The dance routines were more 'challenging' and definitely not 'plastic' type material. I loved all the songs they brought into this movie. Rihanna is a fantastic singer and individual. I like the actresses also brought into it as well. They were very good and some kind of prissy, which was the basis of its appeal. I know they say, ""The first of a trilogy is always a classic,"" but I think you can always have a new one. I think Bring it on: All or Nothing is a new classic. It would be a great movie for all those girls nights.",2006
9,"The characters are likable, the script is great, the acting is brilliant and the finale holds up to the original. All in all, I had great fun watching this film.",2008
6,"I hate to admit it, but BRING IT ON 3 is closer to the spirit of the original than the first sequel, which was pretty awful even when not compared to the sparkling original. A young cheerleading captain (Hayden P.) at a largely all-white, affluent high school transfers to an urban high school when her father loses his job and the family is forced to move. She runs smack dab into a heady dose of reverse racism, and it takes a bit to get that school's cheerleading squad to accept her. She also has to face off against her previous team. The spirit is sassy, and Hayden P. is a decent actress, although she has a way to go before she can be compared to Kirtsen Dunst from the original. Some great cheerleading moves. A worthwhile TV movie for youngsters of all ages. Watch Hayden P. She could be the next Kirtsen Dunst -- or Lindsay Lohan (hiccup!).",2007
8,"OK, being a guy in his thirties, you'd think there'd be only one reason I'd watch it, right? Well, not really. Once you get past the ridiculously short skirts, etc., there's actually a pretty good movie under here. The movie stayed true to its parent, with the standard formula, but that's to be expected for a sequel.",2007
2,"The first two Bring It On movies were both quite good in their own ways. The first was fairly serious, the second was successfully satirical - and the third opted for the usual idiotic low-brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that Hollywood has coming out of the woodwork. The entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation, and that's the extent of this movie's comedy. Ha ha. Not.",2006

Then her world comes crashing down around her when her parents announce that they will be moving and she will be attending an inner city school. She is devastated and vows she will never cheer again until she joins the squad at her new school. Now she's forced to decide who she can trust, who her real friends are, and what guys deserve to be in her life.",2008

7,"I knew Hayden who played Brittany when she was on Guiding Light where she played Lizzie Spaulding. She's grown up and moved on but she'll always be Lizzie to me. In this performance, she takes a rich girl who is moved to the wrong side of the tracks known as Crenshaw Heights from Pacific Vista. She was head cheerleader and popular at her old school. In her new school, she's alone and ostracized for being the white girl. Anyway, she gets on the cheer-leading squad of her new school but tries to hide that information from her old friends. I have to say that Hayden and Marcy Rylan who played Winnie Harper in the film were worth watching. You see Marcy Rylan recently played Lizzie Spaulding on Guiding Light until it ended. Kind of ironic, anyway I felt the film was okay and had a story in it. My only problem is that there were no adults like parents or much about teachers in the film or a coach. Where is the adult supervision during activities?",2010
7,"Bring it on All or Nothing is a pretty good movie. I have seen the first two Bring it on movies and thought the first one was really good and the second one wasn't bad. As with all sequels, the first one is the best because nobody has ever seen it and the following movies are good, but not as good because they have a similar plot. Bring it on All or Nothing is a good movie to watch. I especially liked Hayden Panettiere who played the role of Britney. There isn't anything wrong with the film, there just isn't anything special about it either. Bring it on All or Nothing is a good movie to watch, especially for preteens. The stunts in the movie were awesome. They did really cool lifts and stuff. Bring it on All or Nothing is about a girl Britney, who is the captain of her school's (Pacific Vista High School) cheer-leading squad. She has a boyfriend and a couple of best friends. There is one girl, Winnie, played by Marcy Rylan, who wants to take Britney's place. When Britney's dad has to relocate because of his job, Britney has to switch schools to Crenshaw Heights, where she doesn't fit in, and Winnie gets her wish. She also ends up stealing Britney's boyfriend, Brad, played by Jake McDorman. Britney has to adjust to life at her new school. She vows to her friends at Pacific Vista that she will never cheer again. Long behold, she breaks that promise and joins the cheer-leading squad at Crenshaw Heights. There is some drama and conflict. In the end, Crenshaw Heights and Pacific Vista compete in an audition for Rihanna.",2006
10,"I LOVED this movie! I am a High School cheerleader and have seen all the Bring It On's! I still love the first and second one but this one was VERY good! It had a lot of realistic things in it, GREAT music, AWESOME actors and and overall good plot! I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!!! I recommend it to EVERYONE! : ) All ages and genders will LOVE the movie! It is excellent for cheerleaders and I would recommend it to coaches to pick up music, cheers, moves and more for their squad! I have already purchased the movie and have watched it several times! My parents, family and younger sister have all watched and enjoyed it too! I also like picking up tips and learning dances from the movie! The DVD has extended clips and even more GREAT features!",2006
2,"There was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great. Sadly, like Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 shamed glory of the original Bring It On. There is shameless stereotyping throughout the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. The performance of Hayden Panattiere was sub-par both in terms of acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally cringed because I was embarrassed for the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc) were just so stupid. My recommendation to the makers of any future Bring It On films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the ""acting"" of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film. Only great character: Kirresha.",2006
9,"I counted down the days till Bring It On: All or Nothing came out. I love all of the Bring it On movies. All or Nothing is by far my favorite one, it is very humorous and full of great stunts and cheers. They did a great job with this one, the plot was great and the characters fit their parts perfectly. I really liked how they incorporated a lot of stuff from the old movies along with new stuff that is happening with teenagers today. I watched it with my boyfriend, my dad,and my mom and the guys enjoyed it just as much as my mother and I. Over all it was a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. So if your looking for a fun way to spend the night with the family, sit down relax and enjoy the show!",2006
10,"I loved the movie Bring It On All Or Nothing. It was great. I really liked all of the cheer leading and dancing in it. Great actors and actresses. I enjoyed it. I liked this one the most out of all of the Bring It On Movies. I loved it. I think that the plot and setting of the movie was great and the ending was super. The director and writer of the movie did great, I don't know how you could think up of such a great movie. It was so good and everyone I know that has seen it has loved it too. It was great. The choreographer did super with the cheer leading and dancing in the movie. It was fantastic dancing. I love to dance and it gave me some great ideas. It was a great movie and I really loved it.",2006
1,"Why is this show so immensely popular? Back in 2006, I saw the first episode and thought, Hey, this isn't so bad. As the series progressed, however, I found Hannah Montana to be incredibly dull, unrealistic, and a terrible example for children.",2007
1,"Did I like Disney at one time? I sure did. Especially the Disney Channel, which once had a whole variety of programs to choose from, including those from when Walt Disney himself was still around. But now, those days are over, and the company is now referred to as a has been. I've tried to tolerate Disney in recent years, but anymore, the majority of what comes out of it is plain crap. The show Hanna Montana is a good indication of that.",2008
1,"One thing to say that just needs to be said which sums up this show in a nut shell : Disney have lost all credibility. First of all, to be fair, I am not a young kid so I don't know how young kids feel about this show, but the show consists of (apparently) teenagers. When are Disney going to stop trying to pull off a show about teenagers? Either stop being so conservative and actually show what real teenagers are like or stop humiliating these poor kid actors who are reduced to portraying ultimately complete dorks on the screen. This show is embarrassingly unfunny- Billy Ray Cyrus had one hit album like what a million years ago and now thinks of himself as an actor? Its painful to watch him act and I think bad acting is genetic because shes even worse. The only remotely funny people in the show are Mylee's two friends whom are still not given much to work with script wise but could probably be funny doing something real. The show is simply stupid and made for the mentally retarded. It offers no intelligence, no wit - just the same boring storyline every single episode with the same processed no good acting- I am still scratching my head as to why this show has done so well. Please God - just do us all a favour and take it off the air?",2008
1,"I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Miley Cyrus is an interesting choice to play Miley aka Hannah Montanna, because she can't sing, and she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Emily Osment as Miley's friend Lily. Bily Ray Cyrus and Jason Earles portray Miley's father (and is her father) and Jason Earles portrays her idiot brother thats always getting in to some stupid shenanigan. Two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. It's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. Now I've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. She puts on a wig and suddenly nobody recognizes her? It's moronic. In summation, I hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so I guess that's what they're going for over quality.",2007
1,"Hannah Montana is a famous pop' singer who has to lead a double life (by her own will it appears) as a normal pre-teen in Malibue, California. That sounds good, doesn't it? No. In fact this is one of the worst 'comedies' i have seen, and i've seen Reba and 8 Simple Rules. Hannah and her best friend are supposedly normal pre-teens (i shudder to think what normal adults will be like in the near future) who have to face the usual anticipated challenges of school, 'dating' and 'hanging around'. The idea of a famous star living a normal life could've been done so much better, but it wasn't. The music is awful (both the country music she sings (i admit i hate country music) and the background music) and the gags are terrible. The jokes and scenes involving Billy Ray, who is apparently her manager, aren't that funny either. The best gag i've seen is reminiscent of 'that's so raven'esquire jokes involving bold and unintelligent visual gags based on dim wittedness or lame attempts at covering up some crime or act. Put frankly, this isn't worth watching. Try an episode and you won't be screaming for an encore from this 'star'.",2007
1,"Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana, a teenager who leads a double life who lives with her dad Robbie (has been Billy Ray Cyrus) and her idiot brother Jackson (Jason Earles). I just don't get why this show is so liked and popular, it has to be the worst TV show I have ever seen.",2008
8,"Hannah Montana is mostly considered a good series for girls and Miley Cyrus being a role model for a lot of girls. However Hannah Montana is also a good T.V show for boys because they would consider Hannah Montana to be ""hot"". The series also contain a lot of good songs making it a good series. The vast majority of people who watch it would be girls as boys consider it to be girlie or sissy to watch it so it is not good in the terms that it is mostly aimed at the girls portion of the audience. So overall this is a great series for all girlie girls and all sissy boys (the majority of boys who watch it are sissy boys / lady boys) however some of the boys watch it mainly because Miley Cyrus is hot.",2010
9,"I originally thought here we go again, another annoying stupid lame t.v show that means nothing. But when i watched it i was really surprised. Hannah Montana is actually a really cool show. Miley Cyrus is so funny at times and is a likable character. Lily - is so funny and a character and is unique Oliver - is just plain weird but enjoyable to watch. Jackson - is the most relatable character in the series , if you are the middle child or an older sibling is always getting the attention , in this case Miley having all the attention. i personally relate to him. The episodes are very entertaining , especially when Lily and Oliver start dating. Overall an awesome show. 9/10",2009
1,"This series is so short of a series, it might as well not have existed at all. I tried to watch this show after some convincing of the kids and since there was such a big hype about it. After watching the show, I stared into space and thought...What has Disney come to? This show basically consists of 4 main characters and a bunch of other side characters. Miley Cyrus plays a famous teen star called Miley Stewart /Hannah Montana who at the same time manages a life as a normal school girl. I honestly don't see how a girl manages two lives at once. It's totally unrealistic. Back on topic, Emily Osment plays Miley's ""so called"" best friend who is yelled at and ridiculed by Miley and they still seem to be ""best friends"". Jason Earles plays Miley's idiotic brother and always seems to get into trouble; Not to mention how he is always able to make very off-beat puns. He also seems to work at some sort of a snack shack for a demanding and extremely bratty 11 year old kid named ""Rico"" who is played by Moises Arias. Robbie Stewart who is played by Billy Ray Cyrus is the father of Miley Stewart who always seems to take care of or handle Miley's problems by talking to just her about it. Not her friends or anyone else, just talking to his daughter. Also, he tends to be very moist and vague to help any real life problem, and the problems always are usually simple, and predictable.",2008
1,"I don't have anything against Hannah Montana but her show should be taken off the air it is lame,corny,and boring after watching one episode i wanted to stop watching Disney channel all together it was that terrible she is not that funny. you can tell its her through the blond wig. She didn't really have to do anything to really get the job. there are real actors that are still trying to climb there way to the top and she gets the part no problem. She shouldn't have a Hannah Montana movie her show was only out for what about a year or two now and it is the lamest thing i have ever saw on television. I have one more thing to say why is it that the suite life of Zack and Cody is ten times better than Hannah Montana.",2007
2,"Personally and truthfully, I hate this show. I hated it from the start but I still can't pull myself to rate this show a 1 because, to be honest, I liked SOME of the episodes. But now, it's so unrealistically pitiful. Like how a bunch of people commented on her wig. I absolutely agree, I mean, you can't just put on a wig and expect everybody to not recognize you, how is that possible? It's not! Basically it's like sending out little signals to kids telling them that, it's okay to pretend to be someone else. When it's not. Settle on one! Be a rock star or be a regular kid, you can't have both of those ways. And what's with Jake Ryan Vampire Slayer Dude? One episode he's all sweet and loving and the next he's all super conceited. This show is so indecisive, it kills me.",2008
2,"This terrible show is another failed attempt by Disney channel to appeal to girls (and sadly some boys) between the ages of 10-14. The acting on the show is really annoying, and worst of all they make little annoying kids say ""aaa oh!"". Then the little kids see it, and think it originated from Hannah Montana. Little kids running around everywhere screaming ""aaa oh!"" (the RICO kid is the main culprit. one of the worst parts of the show is how it gives the idea that Hannah is a nice person. Yeah right. A girl like her would make fun of people for looking different than her: for example... if a kid did not have long hair and ride a skateboard she would call him a nerd and toy around with his emotions! The character is shallow and cruel. I am also sick with how Disney gives every boy in their shows long hair. oliver looks like a girl! It is making everyone now-a-days look alike. Why doesn't he grow a Mohawk, or even a mullet. anything to end this fad of looking like a skateboarder. Now i'm even for bringing back Spike hair. (i am also enraged at boys wearing tight pants. yeah they think they look cool now, but how will they feel in 15 years when they are sterile...)how cool would it be if every boy on the show looked different. the oliver kid could have a mullet, Jackson could have a Mohawk...etc. This domination of white kids with long hair and tight pants is really annoying..and shows like Hannah Montana aren't helping! Disney! bring back good shows. don't produce tripe like Hannah Montana that teaches kids to be fashion Na-z-is to one another!",2007
1,"Yes, I'm a guy, and yes, I've watched ""Hannah Montana"". The whole premise of the ""pop star double life"" is actually a great idea, and the only credit I'm giving to Disney in this review. However, the show is terrible in hundreds of ways. The acting is the worst I've ever seen in a TV show, with the exception being Emily Osment. The stories of the episodes are unoriginal and lame. The characters are shallow and basically just walking stereotypes. It is simply unrealistic that ""Oliver"", would hang with Miley and Lilly all day and get involved in their schemes unless he was gay which he probably is. And my last point, why on earth would Disney focus the episodes on dating and breaking up and high school and gossip when Disney knows the majority of the viewers are six year old girls? It's just not appropriate. Do the right thing, boycott this show.",2009
1,"This show is AWFUL! If this show is ""Hannah Montana,"" it's not about her that much. Mostly Jackson, Robby Ray, Rico, and Oliver are the funny ones and Miley and Lily are barely shown and aren't that funny. Also, the plots are mostly about Miley protecting her secret life. Also, the effects are horrible. When someone is flying or picked up, you can obviously see they are fake. Overall this show is horrible. If anyone watches this and likes it, they are crazy. It's cheesy, overrated, and a waste of time. Finally, this show is too serious, it's always, ""do the right thing"" and it's never bad.",2007
8,"Some people say on here it's like That's So Raven, which is false. This show is great, I give it 7 out of 10. It just makes me laugh on a sad day. I can always look up to this show to make my frown to turn upside down. People in my grade feel dumb watching Disney channel, especially this show, but it's like, don't care what people say. Have you noticed that Disney sort of becoming teen or Junior High Standards, which is really good. This show has great actors and actress' in it. They share their talent with us, so we should respect them for that. Also, even though the show might have stupid things in it, it still is funny to me, and I still like it. Anyone can relate to them. Mitchel,(Oliver) the sweet guy, but gets picked on by the mean kids, and likes a pop diva. Emily, (Lilly) she is best friends with Miley, she tries her best at standing up for people, and always knows when to seek revenge. Miley, she wants to be a normal girl, with no problems in her life because of being a pop star. In a way, you can relate to them. That's my comments.",2006
1,"This has to be one of the worst television shows that I have ever seen and that is saying something. Why is it so bad? Where to start? The acting is awful and not funny at all even though this calls itself a comedy. The humour is forced and it is like the actors are holding up ""laugh"" cards so the studio audience (who should be paid a fortune for sitting through it and forcing themselves to laugh) know when to. Miley Cyrus can not act and ever line she says is like she has been forced into to it. Her character is irritating as the pop star/ ordinary girl who just wants to be like everyone else but have the pop star life style as well. Each plot of every episode is Miley Stewart getting into a tricky situation, almost being uncovered as Hannah Montanna, then not and everyone is happy. Plus Miley walking around with her arms swinging about making a weird expression with her teeth. The other characters don't make this any more interesting and are just as annoying. Billy Ray Cyrus makes constant references to his one and only hit and writes songs for his daughter which, lets be frank, aren't any better. Jason Earls is the only reason this got one star as he can be quite funny but sadly that doesn't happen often. Overall a truly awful show that should be taken off the air immediately.",2008
1,"Alright, let's get this started. Okay, so, first thing I'd like to point out about the Hannah Montana Series... How many names does this person have? Miley Cyrus, Miley Stuart, Destiny Cyrus, Destiny Ray Cyrus, Hannah Montana... How should I refer to her during this comment? I'll just go with ""Miley""...",2008
9,"Some people don't like this show but I really love it. Destiny ""Miley"" Cyrus has a weird accent, she is from Tennessee and she lives in Malibu, California. She lives a double life as a normal eight grade teenager and as a famous pop star (""Hannah Montana""). It's funny sometimes and the characters are lovable like her brother Jackson trying to hook up with girls. Her best friend Lily who's a total dork (I know but she's my dork, lol)Oliver is the slow one (like Chelsea from That's so Raven) and her real life dad--""Billy Ray Cyrus"" is so funny! Well I think that is all I can explain about the show...if you don't like the Disney Channel shows than you might not like it but if you do you will adore Hannah Montana.",2006

10,"The Disney Channel used to be a very good network in the 90's but for the past few years have put some of the stupidest shows on television on Disney and totally went down the drain in quality. So I never watched the network again, well at least not until now. The Disney Channel has something special with new series ""Hannah Montana"". When I saw the promo for this show before it aired I thought it was going to be just another corny show from Disney. I wasn't even planning on watching it but I was bored one day and there was nothing on so I decided to see how bad it really was. In a total surprise I thought it was a delightful and funny show, along with great characters, great acting, and funny scripts. ""Hannah Montana"" starts Miley Cyrus and her dad Billy Ray Cyrus who also plays her dad on Hannah Montana. Miley is really singing pop superstar ""Hannah Montana"", but most of her friends at school have no idea. In the show Miley and her dad moved from Tennessee to Malibu so she can have her music career. Miley's best friend Lilly, played by Emily Osment, adds a lot of humor to the show. The only thing I noticed is that the writers are still seem uncertain of how her character should be permanently act on the show. It seems like the past few episodes that she acts completely different from one episode to another, in different parts. But thats okay because her acting makes up for it. Miley's brother Jackson, played by Jason Earles, adds more humor to the show. I think the entire cast is great. But the best thing is that its a real funny show. Yes there are sometimes in the show where it gets a little corny but I can deal with that, plus I understand its geared for younger teens. I am 20 years old and never watch shows like this but this one is not just for kids, its for anyone. Its a cleaver show and its entertaining. I give it a 10/10 because it had to take something amazing to get me to watch a Disney Channel show, but ""Hannah Montana"" has got me hooked. It's way much better than Lizzie McGuire. I am not a fan of the music, but thats not my style anyways, but you don't have to like the music to think that Miley Cyrus is a great young actress. She has a big acting career ahead of her. Overall if you haven't checked out ""Hannah Montana"" yet, CHECK IT OUT.",2006
3,"The new series of Hannah Montana have just come out, and so I'll make another review about it. I know that this one will be put way at the last pages for reviews because it's not a good review, but I'll write one anyway in hope that someone will read it: ",2007
9,"When I first saw the previews of Hannah Montanna I was like 'Great,just another show that's for little kids'. But then when my friend who is 1 year OLDER than me started to RAVE about how good Hannah Montanna was, I decided I'd give it a chance.",2006
1,I personally don't like Hannah Montana.,2007
10,"Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",2006
9,"Since there is very little in the negative column, let me disperse with it first: 'Blood Diamond' might fairly be accused of 'bleeding heart syndrome' (more on that in a bit), has a few minor pacing issues and seems unsure with how to end. The ending that they chose extends the film too far, seems forced and is tacked on. The more natural ending is on the mountainside -- you'll know what I mean when you see it. Those things said, the positives are much greater and this film showcased two towering performances. Djimon Hounsou is nothing short of incredible and I'd be astonished if he isn't considered at Oscar time. Secondly, although I've had little patience for him before, Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me this year. With his performances in 'The Departed' and now 'Blood Diamond,' I think I need to reappraise my own biases against him. I'm becoming a fan.",2006
8,"Leonardo DiCaprio has become one of the premiere American actors. With a set of natural instincts that lends a non-showy, believable quality to all of his performances, versatility, and movie star size charisma that fills up the screen and emotionally hooks the viewer into his character and story, it is hard to think of another male American actor (with the exception of Johnny Depp) who is consistently giving an audience its money worth; these two gentleman have taken the reins from Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, as those two Oscar-winning future legends of the silver screen gracefully age into more mature roles.",2006

8,"The torturous road of South African diamonds to the greedy fingers of an indifferent world makes this new Edward Zwick movie one of the most powerful Action/Adventure/Dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The perfect balance between entertainment and a thoughtful social commentary helps the center of the story to have a real heart and a palpable respect for us, the audience. All this praise and I still have not mentioned Leonardo Di Caprio or Djimon Hounsou but I'm going to. Di Caprio opens a new door, introducing us to a character who is a first in his already extraordinary career. He startled us as a very young man with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" before he fell with a serious case of Titanictis. Now, after a three a long and serious Scorsese cures, this spectacular actor makes me believe that we haven't seen anything yet. Remarkable. As remarkable as the soulful Djimon Hounsou who manages to give the film a visible soul. I was moved and yes, I must admit, surprised. Apart from the visual and interpretative prowess of ""Blood Diamond"" there is a realistic view of a third world country as shattering as the unforgettable one in ""City Of God"" Don't miss it.",2007
8,"A few years back I had the pleasure of visiting Antwerp, Belgium, a place many deem ""the diamond capital of the world."" Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much ""bling"". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.",2006

10,"First I want to say I went into this movie with hopes of it being great but had heard numerous slams against the acting, mostly Leo's accent. Wow were they DEAD WRONG! The movie delivers everything it should have and more. I like going into a movie and being entertained and learning something at the same time, especially at the ridiculous costs of tickets now days. I must say the movie was graphic at times but I think it needed to be in order to get the point across so if you have trouble watching terrible things happen to people including children then I wouldn't recommend this movie. Overall I hope this movie gets some nods when it comes around to Oscar time, Leo deserves a nod for sure whether it be from this movie or from The Departed. So if you don't have a problem with violence and want to learn something and be entertained at the same time then this is the movie you want to see! Kudos to Ed Zwick and everyone involved in making this wonderful film, it was a real treat to watch.",2006
8,What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.,2006
10,"I saw this on December 2nd in La Canada, CA @ a Sneak Preview...a week before it opened nationwide. How do I express my utter satisfaction & amazement with this film.",2006
7,"Blood Diamond is an excellent example of how Hollywood formulas can suck the essence out of a unique work of art. The film is exceptionally well done, with great performances, well-written characters, good research and, above all, shocking messages. To all those reviewers who thought it wasn't ""interesting"": Are you kidding me? Three of the most horrible tragedies of our times are shown in the film: - Africa's child-warriors - Militia-led smuggling supporting brutal civil wars and exploiting ancient hatred - The diamond monopoly and its ruthlessness. And the film shows how these are intertwined! If this doesn't touch you, I don't know what will. ",2007
8,"Beautifully filmed. The three leads are at their very best. An incredibly stunning story that will stay with you for a long time after. For me, the one negative item in this beauty was the final scene. I don't know what compelled the filmmakers to shoot the final scene in what amounted to a gratuitously happy, Disney-like ending -- our long suffering hero surrounded by grinning journalists, politicians and do-gooders in a standing ovation. This detracted from the impact of the film when a simple caption stating Salomon's fortunate resolution over a stunning visual would have sufficed (they did this with other factual information anyway). Other than this very small item, Blood Diamond was well worth seeing. You'll never look at a diamond ring the same way again. I certainly wouldn't buy one.",2008
10,"This is seriously one of my favorite movies. Every actor in this movie played their part PERFECTLY. I've watched this movie like 5 times now in the past four months. I got it off of Utorrent, But I am getting a copy for my birthday. Lots of action, great storyline, stunning ending. All the perfect things you could put into a movie - in this one movie. I would recommend this movie to absolutely anyone.I have NO IDEA why it got so many bad reviews. Apparently, movie critics these days couldn't see a great movie if they were sitting on their butts watching it XD Watch it you won't be disappointed!!! Everyone that I've watched this movie with were obsessed with it.",2008
10,I have never written a review but this film was so moving that it made me write in its praise....,2012
9,"Once in a while comes along a movie that you can describe in one word: perfect. This movie revolves around a diamond smuggler, a father that has lost his family and a journalist all caught in the middle of a civil war zone. Dicaprio gives once of his best performance in this movie, you can really feel how he despise his tough attitude is a good man inside and Jennifer show us how we can ignore the bad things and how even if we care about them there's really nothing we can do. This movie has a lot of violence but they achieve that without making this a gore films, you can see the desperation in the peoples eyes and the bad guys are really scary, with its more than two hours your fell you don't want it to end. A masterpiece.",2012
9,"The film is made again on another rising subject of Africa. There are a lot of activities going on in the world. We are unaware of all those and films are the best medium to show us what we might miss in a newspaper. The film explores the mindset of the people in Africa and how diamond industry works. May be films sometimes show unrealistic things but supposing half of them are true, I cannot imagine the horror that goes on among the people of Africa. The film has a lot of action along with a very nice story with a crisp direction which will take you to an entirely different world. Of course if Leonardo is in a film, much of the success should be attributed to him. It is a real treat to watch him bring a role to life. The role that he plays is very similar to that played in body of lies. The soundtrack is worth mentioning here which emphasizes the horror to a much more extent. The film is successful in exploring how trust swings as circumstances change and of course I got the hang of the ending in the starting only but it is the way how Leonardo successfully plays his character that kept me seated. MESSAGE : ""You have to pay for your deeds.""",2012
10,"Such real human tragedies deserve our attention. Now, more than ever, our power of buying as consumers can be informed in such a way that products such diamonds and their processed form come from conflict-free zones. This was an unbelievable interpretation of all actors who depicted the extreme violence and utilization of children indoctrinated to become terrorists, to a realistic level. An amazing contrast of the beauty of Sierra Leone in such picturesque placement of green mountains and luxuriant vegetation with the shed blood of victims and supporters of diamond smuggling reflect the sad truth that money, guns and power are everything important to survival. Ultimately, although dear characters of the movie take their life routes, truth and values of life take their supreme place on the set up stage. Brutality, illegality, terrorism, child abuse, all tie in one big story released in the Western world for everybody to learn. Solomon stands for justice!",2012
10,"I first saw this film in theaters with my brother and mother. I personally had no idea what the movie was going to be about, I am just a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan so I decided to check it out. I ended up loving the movie it was so interesting because, it was about something I had no idea was going on in the world and probably would never have learned about since I am a teenage boy and am not very interested in Diamonds. While watching the film I was just in complete shock the whole time. With in ten minutes of the film a peaceful village is ambushed and massacred by rebels, the director also was not shy about showing the gruesomeness of people being killed. I could not believe the things that were happening in this movie, people were either forced into slavery or murdered. Children were kidnapped and brainwashed. The kids were doing Drugs and murdering people it was really disturbing to see. I could not believe that this stuff was really happening in Africa but the film showed the statistics of the deaths of all the people from mining diamonds and it was all the proof I needed. Asides from all the graphic and disturbing scenes in the movie I loved the story line of a African man Solomon Vandy trying to find his kidnapped son, while Leonardo DiCaprio is more interested in finding the extremely rare and valuable Blood Diamond which Solomon Vandy has hidden in a rebel camp. I also love the transformation of Leonardo DiCaprios character from a selfish only cares about him self to a stand up guy who is willing to give up anything in the end for his new friend Solomon. I also Enjoyed the third main character Jennifer Connolly who is trying to bring light to conflict diamonds to the rest of the world so this madness can finally stop. Overall I loved the film and highly recommend it to any one, aside from the graphic scenes its a great film for anyone over the age of 13, I thought the acting was great and so was the story line and all the imagery used.",2012
8,"In all of the movies that he has starred in (that I have seen), up until Catch Me If You Can, Leonardo DiCaprio has delivered reasonable but hardly block-busting performances. He had a superbly roguish charm in Titanic, and provided a considerable amount of tension in Gangs of New York, but these performances still didn't have the extra ""oomph"" that would boost the star to award-worthy levels.",2008
8,"'Blood Diamond' is a very well done movie. There's a good script, good directing and touching acting. Although I do feel that the mini flood of African themed movies in the past couple of years is a bit lop-sided, with most people these days probably thinking of trucks carrying stoned child soldiers when they think about Africa.",2007
9,"It's graphic but there's not a clean, nice way to tell a horrific story. It's riveting as well as giving the viewer a badly needed education about the unimaginable atrocities which are an ugly part of everyday life in 3rd world countries. I don't know how factual it is re: conflict diamonds but the movie motivated me to find out. My only real issue with the film was the line ""God left this country a long time ago"". Sounds an awful lot like the line from A Place in the Sun where Bruce Willis says ""God left Africa a long time ago"". Seems to me that the writers could have worked a little harder at being a little more original. Wouldn't something like ""God long ago deserted Africa & her people"" have been more original & just as powerful? I consider this a greater flaw than technical inaccuracies thus 9 stars out of 10.",2007
10,"I saw this movie on Saturday and what an eye opener. This movie really moved me to tears. I thought actors Dicaprio,Hounsou,and Connelly gave the most passionate performance's I've seen in a long time. These actors should all get an Oscar nod for this movie no doubt. The cinematography is beautiful and the message for the movie is loud and clear. Edward Zwick once again has made a fantastic movie. The main thing is this movie hopefully will open everyone's eyes to the violence and abuse that blood diamonds cause. You can make a difference as a consumer in being knowledgeable in what you are buying. I don't mean to preach but I tell ya this movie really moved me and has made me look at things differently. Thanks for taking the time to read about my movie review.",2006
10,"Blood Diamond is a brilliant movie! It's a rare gem that sends a huge political message on one of the many, malevolent schemes and systems, that are happening in this world! This one in particular are the trade and smuggling of Blood Diamonds and Child Soldiers. The movie is very disturbing. Rarely do we a see a motion picture show such horrible schemes going on in the world. ",2013
10,"The fact this movie got mixed reviews is crazy is unreal. This film is so raw and to the point its ridiculous. Unbelievable story its true even if the film its self is not. Definitely one of my top ten if not my favorite movie. Even if the story wasn't as good as it is the acting is great. I can't believe Leonardo didn't win best actor for this performance, it but him above and beyond any actor of the last two decades. Not that his resume wasn't great but by far his best performance. Supporting cast is great as well, its a must see! Even if its not your favorite movie after its worth the time to watch it, the fact that movies now a days are all remakes this movie holds its own as one of the best films of the 2000s.",2013
8,"Usually when a film has a Part III, it leaves you with, ""Why did they make a third film?"" Case in point, ""Smokey & The Bandit"". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.",2006
7,"I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway, I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah, this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it's actually pretty entertaining, and isn't all that bad.",2006
7,"The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised.",2013
9,"When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realised that it would feature none of the original cast members, I was sure it would be a major let down that was just cashing in, so I ignored it. Eventually, I sat down to watch the movie when it arrived on Sky and I must say that I'm impressed. The film more than exceeded my low expectations and whilst it way a little bit routine in places, I had a great time watching it.",2008
8,"""The Fast And The Furious"" series opened the cinema for a whole new way to make car movies. This 3rd movie from this series added the cherry on the top of a sweet cake. Lots of action during the whole movie and, I must say, a very good argument. Way better than the 2nd movie with some characters very well created and also their evolution through out the movie.",2006

7,"What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.",2006
10,"I just came home from the drive in, i was looking forward to this movie since i have read some good reviews about it and also that I'm a car freak. A lot of people have been bashing this movie without even seeing it and bashing the idea of putting a RB26DETT Motor into a Mustang, i agree its not right, but it is just a movie and if you can get past that then you will enjoy it...anyone who loves the sound of a tuned skyline will love it. Keiichi Tsuchiya makes an appearance in this movie and so does Sonny Chiba, but i wont spoil the other cameo. ",2006
8,Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.,2006

8,"Hey, this movie was actually pretty good!! I'm amazed!!.. I enjoyed the first F&F but it totally got super cheesy in the 2nd... and with all the local teenagers dressing up their $400 cars to be ""Fast & Furious"", frankly I was just sick of the whole thing...",2006
7,"The Fast and the Furious franchise relies on the simpleness of 2 factors to attract an audience from boys to men - sexy cars and fast babelicious chicks, topped up with plenty of testosterone and adrenaline in overdrive. Racing cars of all makes, be they the European, American or Asian models, one thing's for sure, the stunt driving team deserves all the credit. The first movie made a huge star out of Vin Diesel, while the rest had relatively smaller shots at glory, from Paul Walker, who returned for the second, to babes like Eva Mendes, Michelle Rodriguez and Devon Aoki.",2006
8,"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the least popular of the Fast and Furious franchise but it's also the most underrated. While I thought the country accent was a little overblown and some of the cgi looked a little too obvious, the movie was really good. The plot is fresh and exciting, the acting is spot on, and the cars are great. That's honestly one of my only gripes with 2 Fast 2 Furious is that, while really entertaining, it got away from the car element quite a bit. This movie brought back the cool car factor that made the first film so special. Overall, while it wasn't as good as the first two, it was still a great movie in its own right and one that can stand alone without the others.",2013
2,"When the first Fast and the Furious was released it was a amazing simply because it was among the first of its kind. Though the acting wasn't that great (and it wasn't expected to be) , on the whole it was still pretty good. The cars , the speed, the babes, graphics, special effects.. was all together sinfully delightful experience .... like eating a bar of pure chocolate..",2006

9,"I was fortunate enough to see an advance screening of the film last night. I'm not usually one to seek out action films but this one seemed different. First of all, the setting was intriguing. Secondly, trailer made it out to be a fun summer flick. And guess what? It delivers. I would strongly recommend this movie to be seen in a theater as opposed to DVD for one huge reason: the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater laughing, cheering, and gasping with everyone else. That environment is what these movies are made for. I loved the first fifteen minutes of the film. From the creepy pep rally to the metal detectors, the film was able to slip a little social commentary. The first race in the construction site was not only amazing but a great comment on capitalism. Even if the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the beginning it doesn't matter. The film flows effortlessly and what would have been contrived just feels real. I know these films get all the feminists all up in arms but hey, beautiful girls exist in this world and the way it's shot it never feels exploitive. Enough of the politics. Grab a few friends and try to watch it with a sellout crowd. You won't be disappointed.",2006
6,"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.",2006
1,"We just saw this movie in Kansas City and to say that it was a huge disappointment does not begin to tell how bad it was. The race sequences were okay, but there is absolutely no point to the dialog or plot. This movie is unbelievably demeaning to women, starting with the blonde babe at the beginning who offers herself as the prize to the winner of the race between the Lucas Black character and the ex-kid from Home Improvement, and continuing with the Janet Jackson look-a-like who has nothing to offer but coy smiles and short skirts (not that there's anything wrong with that). What's worse is the fact that Lucas Black is cast as a 17 year old, when he looks like he's already in his thirties, and the Yakuza uncle character who looks like he's doing a very weak imitation of Don Fanucci from Godfather II. We were hoping for a little summer entertainment, a la Transporter 2, but what we got instead was too little action and too much posing. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this piece of garbage should be blacklisted from Hollywood. In fact, to say that this was worse than the worst movie ever gives it too much credit. It is the worst movie imaginable.",2006
8,"""Better Luck Tomorrow"" director Justin Lin's ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" qualifies as a departure from the norm for a franchise. First, the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second, until the ending, we don't see anybody familiar. Although the hero is a misunderstood misfit, he isn't anything like the major characters in the previous films. Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble, but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell, he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably, our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action, especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here, particularly during a town race, is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving, """"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" ranks as a good movie. Of course, the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow, but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fish-out-of-water hero. Brian Tee makes a first-class villain as TK, while Sung Kang is appropriately laid-back and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts, adrenalin-laced races, and a sympathetic protagonist make this ""Fast and Furious"" installment a breath of fresh air.",2014
8,"okay so most people are expecting another version of the original two. well its not, its a whole new kinda racin. so don't go in expecting to see straight roads. and yeah the film takes a while to get going, but its all info that u need to understand the film.",2006
8,"Loved the film. Finally a summer movie that lives up to its worth. The first 15 minutes of the movie is the tightest i've ever seen. It just bowled over all the boring parts and keeps moving. The first race is the best I've ever seen. And just when I think that's it the second one tops it. The setting of Tokyo was a great choice and fresh. I didn't know MC Hammer owns that city. Sonny Chiba was cool but this Sung Kang guy is a stud. Can't wait to see him in other films. Oh yeah, the third chase gets even better and unlike other films, the last one actually lives up to its worth. Now I have a film to watch for the rest of the summer after I get disappointed by all the poser summer films out there.",2006
1,"Whoever voted for this so highly needs to be educated. The plot was absolutely horrible. How is a race going to settle the conflict? How did a busy Tokyo street completely clear up because he honked his horn. How did he learn to be the best at drifting in a few days when he was no where near a good racer as is. The whole crowd was outraged and laughing at the idiocy of the writers at this part, among many others. There was no depth to any of the characters. We barely saw any nice cars, although the drifting was nice. The whole movie was not tied together at all. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. Don't pay to see this movie. You will feel gipped.",2006
3,"This is my first movie review. Prior to this, I had no intention nor any reason that would provoke me to respond to a movie by writing a review. I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.",2006
8,"""Idiocracy"" is the latest film to come from Mike ""Office Space"" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. It is a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. They were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.",2006
8,"There's no other word for it...Fox dumped this out, with NO marketing of any kind. Nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. All the red flags have flown. It has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Though Office Space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. It's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.",2006
9,"This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I had anticipated it for a long time, and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.",2006
7,"As social satire, Idiocracy is just as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope. To criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, I think. There are certainly fart jokes etc., but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of ""culture"" in the world of 2500 AD visited by Joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. The real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the depiction of Fox News. The subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at ""smart"" people, and average Joes like the protagonists. Note the times in the film when Joe and Rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. I don't know what to say about the ""made for conspiracy theory"" behavior of Fox in releasing this film, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it. We all need to see this film, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes...",2006
10,"I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because I just saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I guess it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's ""The Trial"" meets ""Beevis and Butt-Head"", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you're going to see it because you want a sequel to Office Space you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. I just saw the 8pm show opening night in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. That's really a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while. But then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie-going audience so I guess it's no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it.",2006

7,"A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking. Many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.",2006

Mike Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards.

A futuristic world populated by pampered, self-indulgent morons spoon-fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in H.G.

10,All I have to say is that the person who wrote this is a genius. If you live in a big city you can see this happening for real. I laughed until I went to work and saw that some of the people around me were behaving like the dumber characters in the movie. I think this didn't end up in most theaters because it hit a little too close to home for most people. Fox most likely thought that the writers were talking about them. ,2008
10,"Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, which paid Judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks ""all faggy."" Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like ""can we family style her"" and ""hey man, I'm 'bating here!"" This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.",2006
10,"This movie is comedy gold. The cabinet discussion of Brawndo and the nature of electrolytes is worth the ticket price alone. Standout performances were Luke Wilson in the title role, Dax Shephard as Frito, and of course, President Dwayne Elezando Mountain Dew Camacho (I give you my WORD!). It's simply worth seeing, because the comedy is both excellent the subject is something that has not been dealt in this way for most of the history of film.",2007
10,"Despite some flaws and missed opportunities, the movie provides a brilliant social commentary, attacking populist anti-intellectualism. By making the protagonist into a 'regular' guy, the movie attempts to bring down to earth the viewpoints and social views of the intelligent elite of society.",2007
10,"Some will view this movie only as comedy, but others, like myself take it as a warning.",2013
10,"I am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film. The acting was fine, there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling. It is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children, or choose to have none at all...whereas dumb ass ""W in '04"" supporters are procreating like rabbits. And, though I don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years, I can see Mike Judge's parodied prophet coming to be, as life imitating art. The world is being run by idiots, and it will get worse as the intelligent free-thinking people become the minority and the ""git 'er done"" fans outnumber them. The proof is our farce of an election.",2006

10,"I think the reason why this gem did not score better with the huddled masses, is that the masses felt that it hit a little close to home. The comedic creative license allowed for there to be semi-sophisticated machines interacting and/or guiding the less-than-intelligent which, even now, does not seem entirely far-fetched. Set aside the distasteful preoccupations with farts, boobs, and Testicle injuries (a current favorite among AFHV fans), the society portrayed here is actually frighteningly close to what's already at hand. The mock-science at the onset of the movie, as far-fetched as it may sound, is again, true very much to our nature. In short: If you are capable of laughing at yourself, this is a brilliant movie. If you feel threatened by the picture that this story portrays of our current culture and its' likely potential, then it will likely receive a low score. ...Oh, right. It did get a low score!",2009
10,"I am a middle school teacher. This movie was almost too true to be funny. I see this every day. Kids ARE getting dumber by the minute. Thankfully, I will not be alive in 500 years but it would not surprise me at all if this movie portrayed a very realistic America in 2505. Where I teach, the high school drop-out rate is almost 50%. Parents of these kids probably have a higher drop-out rate. They think ""I did o.k. for myself so my kid will do o.k. if he drops out"". Pitiful. What a sad way to live. ""Doing o.k. for myself"" means having a big-screen television to watch wrestling and other violent shows. It means having a vehicle that runs (sometimes). It means making a little above minimum wage. The attitudes portrayed in this movie are very much alive. This movie should be a wake-up call to anyone who thinks things are o.k. like they are now.",2007

If you are incapable of understanding the satire of this film, it's because you have already been dumbed down by the media and are well on your way to becoming one of the future-morons in this film. Fox is trying to bury this film because they realized that by putting this movie out they're offending the ignorant and the corporate whores (in other words, their bread & butter). Just the fact that they are trying to bury it is a testament to the power of this film's message. Go see it because it's a laugh-until-it-hurts, screamingly funny film, AND because the powers-that-be DON'T want you to see it.",2006

4,"Perhaps I just don't get the movie business, but I never thought they could squeeze three more sequels out of this franchise just by naming random characters Stifler. So this time around it's some guy named Erik Stifler's turn to lose his virginity and get into misadventures, while in the meantime his interchangeable friends just kinda stand around and remind everyone his name is Stifler. They do that like, a lot. I think the name Stifler is said about every six seconds or so, and all these references do is make you wonder why you're not watching the real thing. Occasionally there's some vaguely funny stuff going on, like in the scene where the gang plays football against midgets, but whatever potential this movie had is ruined by the ridiculously awful dialogues. Even The Sherminator had cooler lines than the cool guys in this movie. The trash talk scenes have to be seen to be believed, and even then. And I can laugh at the dumbest, lowest, raunchiest things, but guys using their boners as baseball bats is just really unfunny. And also, why the hell is Jim's Dad still around? Anyway, this movie has a good moment here and there, but for the most part it's dull and very uninspired.",2009

3,"five movies are enough, there's no way people can support another American Pie movie. I Thought that the American Pie franchise was over with the fourth movie American Pie: Band camp, that already was a little lame.It has some funny moments, but most of it its just a movie about sex, nudity and bad words. There's no story at all and the plot seems weak and very plain. Awful acting from everyone. Please the American Pie movies were over with American Wedding, stop using its name to produce bad quality movies. They were the worst two hours in my life. The story was so repetitive, it was like watching the first American Pie but without the funny parts. Even the the brief performance from Eugene Levy wasn't enough to make it a decent film.",2007
6,"The title says it all. I need to really screw my brain to fill the required 10 lines. The actors are completely unknown, the script is not that complex and it's rather bad. The mandatory opposition to the ""team cool"" is a bunch of evil midgets that somehow are better at American football and getting girls.",2008
4,"Very poor entry in the Pie series. ""Band Camp"" didn't compare to the original trilogy but it still had some of that American Pie charm plus a semi-interesting story. It also had some funny gags and some funny lines. All that is missing from this fifth entry. ""Naked Mile"" had no really funny or memorable moments. No story. And a terribly bland, forgettable cast. While the original Pie films felt like a smart homage to the sex romps of the 80s (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds, etc), this one just felt like a retread of the lame straight-to-video sex comedies of the early 90s (Ski School 2, Meatballs 4, etc). No real imagination went into making this movie. It was purely made to quickly cash in on the DVD success of ""Band Camp"". Of course many people will watch this just for the naked mile scene in which several naked female breasts are shown bouncing around. That's about the only watchable scene in this whole film. Sadly, by that merit alone most people will see this film as fitting for a recommendation. Trust me, it's not worth it.",2007
8,"As it goes with most spin offs, I expected this to be a $4 budget poorly written train wreck, but the mix of a Stiffler with moral values,and the classic jerk Stiffler, work well. Stiffler getting the beat down from midgets ( little people) was great. Eugene Levy is all thats left from the original cast but he does a good job, in an Axl Rose minus Slash,Duff, Matt, and Izzy kinda way. He lends credit to the continuing American Pie theme. Although he really had to be placed at weird points, in the movie. It was great listening to him tell cousin Stiffler that he was at the school hanging out, because he's an alumni. Which is actually true, I think? Theschool used was the McMaster University Campus, in Hamilton. Eugenes from Hamilton, and as far as I know went to school at Mac. with Dave Thomas, and other Second City alumni. I would watch this movie a second time, and I think it could have been a strong enough premise, to have been a first run theater movie. It's really funny, and most will enjoy it.

Usually sequels are not so good and they copy so many things, especially from the first movie, but even if it's the fifth American Pie movie, The Naked Mile is really fun and enjoyable. It comes with some original ideas, definitely it has more nudity and even if most of the actors don't have experience, I really liked the way they acted and overall the movie was great. I didn't get bored and the 90 minutes passed so quickly. I think guys will really like this movie and probably girls too, because they also can learn something from this. I give this movie a 10, because it was funny and definitely it wasn't a waste of time.",2006

1,"We just had Foxtel connected and this used condom of a movie spurted out of my big new 106cm telly last Saturday at 5pm. Programmed for that time by some corporate adult pervert who (gleefully) knew lots of unsuspecting underage teens could be morally loosened up by the cheerful naked sexual party imagery and it's relentlessly degrading depiction of healthy looking 20 something Americans, this 5th element of phallus/orifice adoration is exactly the sort of movie that proves to the rest of the planet that the polluting degraded immorally sexually cretinous USA must be annihilated. As I spilled my cock-porn er I mean popcorn over myself I wondered at these lovely looking 20 year olds, getting a gig in a 'new movie' and enthusiastically telling their families, Mum Dad Aunties and Gran and the littlies, about their fantastic new acting opportunity. And then they all go the to premiere, or worse still, the new DVD is brought home, mum throws a party for the street and then they all sit down together and .... this pus ejaculation (with sprinkles) manifests before them. There is their new family film star reduced to be some frat-boy jerk, near nude with duck-lipped tit-faced chicks each yahoo-ing and whooping at each other while every character behaves like a 'f*ckwit'. Tedious immature embarrassment piled upon scene after scene... with the apparently hilarious 'climax' being where two guys stand naked and erect in front of the whole party and conduct some sort of erection carnival (toss a hoop, etc) .. and one 'hilariously' ejaculates over his pals and their girlfriends in some sort of screenplay teen porn orgy fantasy.

Check it out if you liked the other 4 and roll on number 6, This series could go on forever. Its basically about Stiflers cousin who meets up with his other cousin at an event called the Naked mile, This film actually has some background story to it rather than a random film full of random events, The main character is a virgin and as his girlfriend wont have sex with him she gives him a weekend off where he can do what ever he wants, Whether he does you'll have to watch to find out, Enjoy...",2006
1,"Things could not get any worse after AP4 is what I thought. I was wrong. This one is worse and by a big margin. I can remember a laugh or two in the previous one. (I loved American Pie 1. 2 was OK and three was OK.)There simply is not one funny scene in the whole movie. The only character remaining from the previous series, is Eugene Levy (Jim's father) and his is really only a cameo appearance. The highlights are the few scenes you see boob. Apart from that there is not a single redeeming feature in the entire movie. Whatever jokes there are so ""signalled"", corny, stereotypical or just plain not funny. EVEN if you like this kind of movie (as I do). Liked Porky when I was 12 years old. Liked AP1. Basically even if you are into coming of age movies this will suck and be a wast of money and time.",2006

It doesn't get any worse than this. The guys in this flick are a completely lame and the women are floozies. Why would Eugene Levy agree to do this? Does he need the money that bad? What an embarrassment! IMDb tells me that I need a minimum of 200 words to post, so now I need to come up with filler to inform everyone exactly just how bad this movie really is. This movie is complete toxic waste matter and is extraordinarily lame and should have never been made. No one deserves the torture of viewing this dreck. AP5 could be used as a tool to extract information out of terrorist. I'm sure CIA interrogators considered it, however even they have some standards when it comes to cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners. Why is IMDb making me fill out a minimum of 200 words I want to be done with this review. Uggg I need a few more words to make the minimum and this movie does not deserve the effort of my rant. Did I mention this movie is horrid? I would rather scrape out my eye balls with a rusty spoon than view this mess again. Almost there, just a few more words...

Big Willie Weekend has returned, and for good reason! It's a great movie to see during the holidays and definitely a tear-jerker! Perfect for a date, a night out with friends, or even with family. If you ever thought Will Smith really couldn't act (and shame on you!), you'll think otherwise once you see this movie. You can really feel what he's going through just by looking in his eyes.

This is an honest, meaningful film that will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. The viewer becomes fully invested in the struggles of Chris Gardner and his son. Will and Jadyn Smith deserve huge kudos. The real-life father and son dynamic enriched the film and don't know if other actors could have been as powerful.

I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.",2006

Basically, if you see this movie and walk out of it feeling nothing, there is something that is very wrong with you. Loved this movie, it's the perfect movie to end the year with. The best part was after the movie, my friends and I all got up and realized that this movie had actually made the four of us tear up! It's an amazing film and if Will Smith doesn't get at least an Oscar Nom, then the Oscars will just suck. In fact Will Smith should actually just win an Oscar for this role.!!! I loved this movie!!!!

He and his son were just so incredibly heart warming and really reminded you of the important things in life.

The history books will show that this film was released in 2006, but nothing from that year can compare to this either, so it is in my opinion the best movie of two years! Will Smith plays a struggling single father trying to make the best life that he can for his family and for himself. The part is played to perfection, and shows a true master of the craft. His comic timing is still evident in the lighter moments, but it is his sincerity in playing a man with no options, no family, no help and little hope that shows him shining.",2007

1,"In this movie you see a poverty stricken man make it to the top by kissing rich mens butts and working for free in competition with others who have nothing to lose (literally, they are all rich/high class and just in it for the sake of finding a career to make daddy proud). The moral of the story is typical of the Libertarians who produced this film. Serve your wall street masters well enough and perhaps they'll bring you in for a piece of the pie someday, but don't expect anything until you've already given them everything you've got. This movie is horribly unrealistic despite being loosely based on some elements of a true story. If you believed in the message displayed in this movie then you would work 60 hours a week for little to no pay and then find a pot of gold so to speak when you needed it the most. This movie tries to make the claim that there are no failures in a capitalist society except for losers who are unwilling to go the extra mile everyday in their work and that those bust their butts and routinely bend over are greatly rewarded and when they are not it's because they didn't sacrifice enough of themselves, thus they are just losers but the system of having wall street yuppies rule the masses is perfect. This movie is so often misunderstood as a triumph story that it is ridiculous. This movie is a Libertarian attack on fair markets and mixed economy politics. It blatantly shoves the idea down your throat that to make it in America you're supposed to slave away for people who have it way better off than you do and if you do it long enough and well enough than you will be rewarded with the trickle down effect and if you're not so rewarded then you were a loser and any society would be better off without you anyway. That truly is the point and message of this whole movie. If you don't get it then read about Libertarianism and watch the movie again.",2009
2,Am I the only person who saw this film and hated it? The main problem for me was that Will Smith's character irritated me to death. All his problems seemed to me to be of his own making.

The principals all acquit themselves with increasing wit and flair as the series progresses, creating a palpable matrix of living relationships which provide the sort of ongoing back story that insists you return, like that finish at the end of a wee dram of single malt, for more.

10,"I was sceptical when I first heard of ""LEWIS"". Morse had been such an incredible series that I felt sure Lewis would simply cash in on it and be a poor follow on. How wrong I was! Whilst I'm not saying that it has met the incredibly high standard of Morse it is a truly great series in its own right.",2011
10,I expected that Lewis would still be good but not that it would surpass Morse and this has happened and it's because the wonderful team of Lewis and Hathaway.,2012
9,"Lewis hits the spot for me. Great location shots of Oxford, typically unbelievably complicated plots where the destination seems less important than journey, and Kevin Whately's now rather world-weary Inspector Lewis trawling his way through police procedure to arrive at the right solution.",2010
10,"When I want to see an action film or a thriller, no one, in my opinion, beats stuff made in North America. That being said, no one makes better mysteries than the British, and the ""Inspector Lewis"" series is proof positive of that. Kevin Whately is a stand-out as the eponymous character, a diligent yet sympathetic policeman who wears his middle-class background as proudly as he does his badge. It's nice to see Whately taking the helm in this series as it's lead after playing the wingman in the ""Inspector Morse"" shows for so long. He doesn't try to assume the John Thaw role but instead keeps this character all his own. James Fox is the perfect fit as his younger, book-smart partner Hathaway, a dude who can quote just about anything from anywhere, thanks in part to his scholarly background in Theology. These two guys have a very believable chemistry as police partners who work with each other's strengths (Lewis has the hunches it seems and Hathaway has his logic) to solve the multiple mysteries that crop up in the college town in Oxfordshire where they toil. The mysteries presented in the show are never too easy to figure out, giving you just enough clues to try to follow along. Often times it's a really cool surprise when the who-dun-it is solved at the end. I also want to add that, in addition to a great cast, great writing and so forth, they don't flog you with loud obvious music throughout that gives too much away (though yes, there is SOME music and it's quite nice actually). I'm a fan of this show and I hope they keep this series with it's fantastic cast going for a long time to come.",2010
10,"This is a review of Series One to Seven of LEWIS (also known as INSPECTOR LEWIS). I never imagined that a sequel series could surpass the original (INSPECTOR MORSE), but this is what has happened. The stories, writing and direction remain of the same excellent quality, but it is the performances which really put the series over the top. John Thaw as Inspector Morse often overdid the querulousness and could be a bit irritating sometimes, which was meant to be part of his character. But now that he has the top job, Kevin Whateley as Lewis has really come into his own as a heavyweight actor of true stature. He has made Lewis into such a rounded and convincing character that he is more compelling than Morse ever was. (Perhaps this solidity of character is due to Whateley being a direct descendant of one of the three notorious Thompson Brothers, all of them Parliamentary colonels, of the 1640s and 1650s.) But even Whateley's superb acting cannot match the eerie and uncanny brilliance of Laurence Fox's performances as Detective Sergeant Hathaway. Rarely in a TV series has any actor created such massive complexity of character with such understatement and minimalism. Fox's work is sheer genius. One is tempted to compare Fox with John Hamm in MAD MEN (see my review), where we hang on Hamm's every silence, expecting him to speak, but when he does not, we accept the profundity of his silence as part of his secretive character and sympathise with him. This is very much the case with Fox, whose brooding internal life makes us concerned for him. The strong performances of Clare Holman as the pathologist and Rebecca Front as the Chief Superintendent are equally important in giving the essential fibre to the series to ensure its success. Holman's perpetual cheeriness is rather infectious, and all the more fascinating in that she shows it when inspecting corpses. This series (which will have a Season 8 before long) is a magnificent success in every respect. Dom Perignon all round! However, one does have a certain sympathy with the population of Oxford, which has been diminished by so many murders after all of these years that one wonders that there is anyone left alive in either town or gown. I noticed that there appear to be heavy filming restrictions in place, for in none of the episodes do we see the commercial district or the roads with the most traffic. I only recall seeing Oxford Market used once. We never see the High Street except for the small area at the end by Magdalen Bridge. Oxford comes across all glamorous and antique, and you would never suspect there were other parts of the town which are glum rather than glam. The Sheldonian appears to be everywhere, and every angle of that has been covered many times. Some of the colleges appear to have said no. I have never seen the quaint battlements of New College in an episode, for instance. We never see Magdalen's deer park, we never see the endless walks along the river, which are inaccessible to filming vans. In a sense, a mythical Oxford provides the backdrop for this series. But then, that strangely adds to the effect, for by creating the illusion of an Oxford that goes on forever but is really often the same locations shot from new angles, the illusion of endless murders seems only a natural part of the equation D = ME, where D is drama, M is murder, and E is episodes. It is clear according to this equation that the drama can increase linearly if either the murders increase, the episodes increase, or both increase together. No analysis has yet been made formulating an equation expressing the rates of increase, whether two murders per episode cause an acceleration of the heartbeat, and whether nonlinear phenomena occur, such as particularly shocking murders leading to quantum jumps, i.e. hearts skipping beats. I go to Oxford so rarely these days, but on one visit what did my wife and I see but Kevin Whateley getting in and out of his police car near Merton College as the cameras rolled, on the same side of the street as Anthony a Wood's house. Long may he go on doing so. And let us hope that some future edition of Athenae Oxoniensis includes John Thaw, Kevin Whateley, and Laurence Fox as worthies, which they clearly deserve.",2014
7,"The film was made to a high standard, in just the same way as the Morse films, with lots of attractive shots of Oxford. The story is a bit convoluted and not terribly credible - just as was often the case with Morse.",2007
9,"British crime series are always worth watching - even if they are longer than usual, having the length of a real separate film. Vivid, but still realistic characters, picturesque landscapes-townships and short (or sometimes even not visible) evil deeds form a quality standard and widening the audience not keen on constant explosions-fights-killings. I used to watch ""Inspector Morse"" - and I liked it - and ""Lewis"" has the same high level, with one exception: now the supporting character (Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox) is more interesting to me than the main one. It is not the question of acting, but the lines imputed to the persons involved.",2012
10,"This is a dark, thick marmalade with a strong taste of bitter oranges.A very appropriate description for the Inspector Lewis series.",2016
9,"The past couple of years I've had the opportunity to watch several British television series, most recently Inspector Lewis. It's easy to see why this series is so well liked, and now a personal favorite. The plots aren't superficial, the episodes need to be watched carefully in order to not become completely lost. It's a great plus when television can actually engage the mind. There are many references to classic books, plays and music that motivate further research, another plus. Oxford is an interesting and beautiful setting and has brought to life a place that for me has been mostly abstract. The two Inspectors add much needed levity and fresh air to the stuffy university environment, each in their own way. Even though a gifted scholar himself Hathaway's disdain for Oxford and academics in general gives his character authenticity and an edge that's strangely appealing. Laurence Fox does a fabulous job portraying a deeply thoughtful, perhaps somewhat troubled former seminary student turned police inspector, and leaves an intriguing, mysterious allure. Lewis, well-played by Kevin Whately, is a no-nonsense, no frills, honest to the core, kind-hearted, hard-working loyal/devoted family man and friend. He and Hathaway are introverts and keep their personal lives private, a couple colleagues out for a beer much preferable to large gatherings. They ""get"" each other. Hathaway made the comment that if Lewis ever retired he'd probably do something else because who else would understand him so well? I have also enjoyed the character Dr. Laura Hobson played by Clare Holman, a welcome addition to the cast. It would be great to see her more, have her character developed more. The only irritation for me personally is the character CI Jean Innocent. It's not Rebecca Front's acting because she does such a great job coming across as a hard-nosed superior I often get the urge to whop her upside the head. It's difficult to fathom anyone working more than a few months for someone who is so critical, demeaning, demanding, unbending, appearance motivated and just pretty much an arrogant shrew who likes to throw her weight around, who constantly questions the detectives' judgment even though she's been proved wrong multiple times and never misses the opportunity to cross her arms, raise her eyebrows and make remarks like ""don't do it again""; get this settled now or else...""; ""I should demote you to street cop but..."" ""I mean business, get it done..."", etc., etc. Unless she's schmoozing with highbrows she's not a nice person. She once looked at the detectives across from her desk after she'd given them instructions and asked, ""why are you still sitting here like dogs waiting for a trick?"" Really?? She's depicted as a male-basher in a permanent bad mood, like so many British women seem to be portrayed in British series. I don't get it because I've done business and been in various organizations with British women and have had nothing but pleasant experiences, always charming and professional. Most anyone in a position like CI Innocent with that kind of personality would have a constant stream of requests for transfers on her desk and would eventually be under investigation by HR herself. The medieval authoritarian is in serious need of a chill pill. (Xanax anyone?) Other than that it is an absolutely wonderful series with intelligent plots, talented acting, most potentially messy scenes left up to the imagination, lots of well-known actor appearances, intriguing settings and not even close to becoming tiresome or repetitious. I applaud the shows creators and writers, really excellent work.",2016

From the pilot ('I used to row a bit') tot the end (with the LEWIS card just as in the pilot) it is a delight to watch. I never will understand people who think that on first viewing of a detective they saw it all. It's so multi-layered: first the crime, and when you digested that you can just enjoy the way it is made, the beautiful surroundings, the music, the humor, and last bus not least: the friendship. My god, how wonderful this is. When we watched the last episode my wife told me that she saw a tear in my eye. She was right.",2017
10,"Ironically I never was drawn to Inspector Morse, but I immediately became a big fan of Lewis. Having visited Oxford awhile ago, it was fascinating to see the Oxford University colleges being a backdrop to a series that's expertly scripted and with outstanding performances.",2016
9,"I recently watched all the episodes again, starting with with Pilot (Episode 0, as labelled).This show is almost perfection, with fine acting and engaging story lines in a beautiful and civilized setting, except for the last few episodes when it tries to be a little too American. Sorry, there is no other way to put it. The stories become more and more violent, the characters added lack true representation of the British population (hardly any major South Asian characters) but most importantly, the focus shifts from Lewis, the middle-aged Gentle Hero (after whom the show is named!) to Hathaway the Young-and- the-Proud. Even the final scene is off-base. I believe the US backed production has something to do with this obvious shift, not realizing that one of the main reasons British crime shows are so popular in the US (and worldwide) is because, unlike their American counterparts, they are unrealistically more gentle and civilized in their approach to crime and also have something distinctly British about them. So, if any of the producers is reading this, please do not mess with a good thing. Thank you PBS, for getting it almost perfectly right.",2016
3,"Morse was a classic series, largely due to the enigmatic central character brilliantly played by John Thaw, plus the wonderful music. Lewis I have watched again and again and despite the fine acting by Keven Whateley and Lawrence Fox, it never works. The sheer clunkiness of the plots, which Thaw somehow managed to transform or at least make tolerable, becomes oppressive, and panoramic shots of Oxford - always filmed in beautiful sunshine - are increasingly given prominence to try and make the whole thing work. The extended format, which weighed proceedings down in Morse, becomes totally tedious in Lewis. I know I'm in a minority on this but what the heck - in my view the follow-up was a mistake and that's that.",2015

I really really really didn't get that part. 3) If nobody is forcing you to go to this meeting, don't kill the people who are leading it. They're entitled to their opinion. Everybody is. If your cause is just, people will catch on. 4) Is this supposed to engender sympathy for gays? It didn't. It made them look pitiful and stupid and hateful and crazy.

I've seen numerous other ones - Pixel Perfect, Twitches, Go Figure, Stuck in the Suburbs, etc. - but none of them compare to this one. Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens as Troy and Gabriella are adorable together, and their chemistry is more believable than the chemistry I see in many major motion pictures; Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel as Sharpay and Ryan are laugh-out-loud funny; and the other students, along with Troy's father and Ms Darbus, are perfect.",2006
9,"High School Musical is one of those rare movies that makes you laugh at it's absurdity and love everything about it at the same time. The plot isn't complex, Troy meets Gabriella at a New Years Eve party, and they sing a karaoke duet together. Neither has ever sung before, and they find the experience exhilarating. After midnight, when they almost kiss, Gabriella runs away, but not after exchanging phone numbers with Troy. A few days later, Troy returns to school, where he is the star basketball player, just before the ""big game."" Also about to occur, casting for the school's ""winter musicale."" This is where we meet Sharpay and Ryan Evans, a brother and sister musical star team. It is soon revealed that Gabriella is a new student at Troy's school. After a lot of deliberation, Gabriella and Troy audition for the musical, much to Sharpay's, and their friends', dismay. I won't divulge how, but all end up happy, and celebrate in a fantastic closing song ""We're all in this together!"" ",2006

1,"Maybe I'm just a weirdo. After reading all these other reviews, I'm pretty sure that I am. Or maybe it's just because I've been performing with musical theatre companies since I was about seven, so the idea of a musical isn't something novel and new for me. But every time I tried to watch this movie, and every time I heard somebody talk about how great it was, I just couldn't help but CRINGE. Not only was this another long shot for the young Disney stars to prove their ""versatility"", such as it is(n't), but it was yet another show about the magical clich√©s and drama of high school, something I'm getting absolutely sick of. I have to go to school every day and deal with petty high school drama; why would I want to come home and listen to people SING about it? Seriously. At least REAL musicals that used those themes, like Hairspray and Grease, had actual talent behind them, as well as good songs and actual FUN. Not a bunch of pretty-boy jocks smiling cheesily and singing about how much they love basketball. The whole production was so shallow...I still haven't been able to sit through the entire movie. I've had to watch it in sections of twenty minutes, just to be able to stand it. And something that ESPECIALLY bothered me: the representations of the people in the drama club. Dude, that teacher? ""Brava""? You've got to be kidding me. And then that little drama queen and her wimpy brother...so, so clich√©. I haven't met anybody like any of those three since I was, like, ten. And I know, I know: it's just a corny little Disney movie playing up the clich√©s. And for about half a second, characters like that might seem kinda funny. Then try going to school the next day and hear people asking you if you've ever had a director like that teacher, or asking how you can possibly be a ""real"" theatre person because you don't seem obnoxious enough...it gets old. This movie sucked. Why do people like it so much?",2006
3,"One thing that has always irritated me as a high school student is Disney's portrayal, in its various programming, of what high school is like. For the most part, Disney gets it TERRIBLY WRONG, and this is immensely evident in ""High School Musical."" I mean, don't get me wrong, not a day goes by at my school without a fat girl standing up to sing about how her true dream is to dance, but, seriously, its just totally inaccurate. The characters poorly represent actual high school students in that real students actually act their age, are mature, and aren't borderline mentally retarded (Okay, most real high school students aren't immature and mentally retarded). Disney really needs to do more research on high school environments. ",2006

The actors rocked the stage and just  made the movie a teen can watch and who knows maybe one or two can  relate to ""Troy""(Zac Efron),""Gabriella""(Vannesa Anne Hudgens),or even  ""Sharpay""(Ashley Tisdale). Disney has proved itself once again as the  movie magnet!

This movie is for adults and kids and also brought me back to high school even though it was only a year ago! The music brings meaning to the story and without it the movie wouldn't be complete which is why it is called High School Musical! I hope everyone who sees it enjoyed it as much as I did!! If Disney keeps up at this rate all the new actors and actress, singers and everyone will be the new product of them! Look at Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Raven, and many others! This movie has a few soon to be rising stars in it! Good job Disney!!",2006
1,"Okay. First let me state that this is quite likely the worst movie I've seen in the past 10 years. Of course, I couldn't have expected much because the word Disney is not followed by Pixar. First of all, this monstrosity is almost impossible to follow from the getgo. All the characters in the story are crammed down our throat at the same time. The dialogue could easily have been written by any of the 13-year old fangirls whose alphabet consists mostly of numbers, and the letters O, M, and G. There is no plot or character development, and all of these supposed high-school characters seem more like kindergartens. The sappy dialogue is bested by the childish, uninspired score that simply jumps in and out without any pretext or introduction. The wafer thin plot is clich√©d, and has been flogged throughout every Disney movie ever, ""We were mean to you but now we're sorry so let's be BFFLS""(sic). This movie is essentialy an even more watered down version of Grease intended for an audience of 8-month olds, or teenagers with a similar mental capacity. I implore you, if the collective IQ of you and your wallet is equal to 80 or higher, please, please save yourself the worry and never watch this terrible, uninspired, and woefully overrated flop.",2007

10,"I have to admit that at first I was a little bit skeptical at the thought of a Disney Channel Original Musical. However, I am a huge fan of most of the stars in the movie so of course I would watch it. I loved it a whole lot!! I loved the original songs and its portrayal of how some schools still are today. You just get written into a clich√© and are expected to ""Stick To The Status Quo"". Zac and Vanessa were great as the main characters and Kenny Ortega did a great job as a director/choreographer. I definitely will be tuning in tomorrow so I can sing along and Sunday so I can catch some more behind the scenes stuff along with never before seen footage!! I am just happy that this wasn't another cheesy Disney movie that would let me down!!",2006
1,"This movie is simply terrible. If you feel the same go to the Haters Club I started on the boards. Plenty of reasons, including bad acting, singing, and choreography. Many teeny boppers enjoy this movie. Why? Is it the horrible pop songs or Zac Efron, who many think is hot? (come on kids hot!?) Or maybe the choreography which a 5 year old could come up with? The overused plot-line? What? Do kids think that is what high school is really like? Well sorry to burst your bubble, but it's not. Everybody is not going to become friends in the end like in this movie. Well this movie sure is a disappointment Disney, much like your many of your recent movies. Do not watch this. Watch quality musicals like West Side Story. I ask you this: Why, Kenny Ortega, why?",2006

And I love the little undertones and subtleties throughout the film. And I love how all the tough mean hard guys are CLEARLY dancers in real life. I was muy impressed!!

1,"I can understand The Disney Channel when they try to aim toward a children's audience but when I have to listen to the awfully fake singing that is blasting from my younger sister's room as they play the movie constantly, it begins to irritate. One day, I decided to give Disney a chance by actually bearing to watch the movie. Right as it started I began to feel embarrassed for the ACTORS! It was some of the worst acting and singing I have ever heard. I tried my hardest to sit in on the whole thing until it went to the cafeteria scene (if you could call it a cafeteria, more like a Chucky Cheese cruise-liner dining room). I started laughing not because of their failure at being funny, but just how annoying the song was! I immediately turned off the TV and kept laughing. I say that Disney should stick to it's roots and stop airing shows that include ONLY high-schoolers when the viewers are between ages 4 and 12. The messages these shows are giving are either giving children the wrong idea or just going right over their heads. A 1 out of 10.",2006

You won't be disappointed! It should be made into a real stage musical. The plot line was engaging. Very much a feel good movie.

First of all, it's obvious that they're lip syncing throughout the whole movie. It's horribly directed and written. And who the heck sings while playing basketball? Oh yeah, the songs sucked too. And why the heck does everyone go crazy over Zac Efron? He looks like a combination between a monkey and an ugly old woman. Every time someone mentions him I cringe.

2,"I'd give this movie a 2/10, and I'm being extremely generous. This movie begins when Troy, and his father are playing some b-ball, shooting some hoops, practicing during Christmas break. (A little too dedicated, perhaps?) Troy's mother comes, to tell them that it's time for them to come to the New Year's Party, and strangely enough, Troy finds himself shoved on the karaoke stage with Gabriella, the lovely yet shy bookworm. Coincidentally enough, they begin to sing, and sound wonderful. (Very predictable) So, how Gabriella manages to not only be very pretty, but also intelligent, talented, and fashionable, not to mention how she gets the guy in the end, I can't even begin to fathom. No one has it that together, or at least in reality. Troy is the typical high-school athlete, only his father is the coach of the b-ball team. Typically enough, his father is pushing him to play basketball, but he loves to sing, doesn't this fairytale sound familiar? Didn't Chad Michael Murray's character in A Cinderella Story have a similar background? And what of Eddie in Eddie's Million Dollar Cookoff? (Another lame Disney Channel movie, but that's for another day) When they have finished their karaoke number, Troy and Gabbie watch the New Year come, and he takes a picture of her on his cell phone. (Am I hearing ""CORNY""?? Oh yeah) Then we skip ahead in time, to when the new school semester begins. Ironically, (again, so predictable!) Gabriella is going to be a new student at Troy's school. The character of Sharpay is introduced, and of course, as they so typically are, she is the preppiest of the preppy, and as she strides confidently through the basketball players, shoving them aside to get through, one of the players, Chad says, ""I guess the ice princess has come back from the North Pole. And back from where she always is during vacation."" I hated the character of Sharpay, but why is the mean girl, once again, the stereotypical blonde bitch? I'm seeing Regina in Mean Girls, Shelby in A Cinderella Story, Kate in Lizzie McGuire, Lana in The Princess Diaries, I know this character all too well... why do they never change her? Tagging along behind Sharpay is her quiet, flashy-dressed, gaudy brother. Now seriously, are they insinuating throughout the movie, using subtle hint after subtle hint that Ryan is homosexual? There's no real closure at the end of the movie, as they never say whether he is or not, is the audience just supposed to sit and wonder? He wanted to meet Ashton Kutcher, he had rhinestones on his tee-shirt, he lets his obnoxious sister push him around... could it be any more obvious? So why no closure? Well, it IS a Disney Channel movie after all, so maybe that would explain it. I guess the teenyboppers don't care.",2006
1,"This can't even compare to Grease or Fame - I'd say a better comparison is Grease 2, although mentioning From Justin to Kelly would be much more accurate as to what this ""film"" is like. Writing that makes Saved by the Bell look erudite, songs that come out of nowhere and mean nothing to the plot, annoying stage-mother-driven kids that can't act (or sing, according to reports that singing was dubbed). No distinct look, a lack of production numbers, and the most disposable score I've heard in years contribute to this being one of the worst musicals I've had the displeasure of sitting through. Mind you, I'm sure the kids will eat it up, as kids are notoriously undiscerning in their entertainment as long as it's packaged correctly.

This could be better like it could have been longer. I'am going to watch the Sing a long tomorrow and the making of the movie on Sunday.I hope that maybe they will make a High School Musical 2 in the future.If they did that then they should keep the original cast.So, anyway's this movie so rocked and I'am going to keep watching it each time it comes on T.V. I hope that everyone enjoyed this movie as much as I did.(P.S so should really watch this movie.) See Ya!",2006
1,"In the month of June 2007 I sat down with a nice snack and turned on the television, that's when I saw Disney's movie 'Highschool musical' on. I decide to watch it since it was ALL the talk nowadays, let's just say I have a peanut allergy and I had a reaction to that movie worse then my deadly allergy. It was the most HORRIBLE movie I have see to this day, I had to baby sit my little sister who was in love with the teletubies and this movie made that movie look like an award winner. I honestly have no clue why the rating is so high if it was a work of crap.",2007
2,"Bah. Not the most realistic portrayal of high school there is out there. Besides the unrealistic plot, the characters almost seemed too, erm, cookie-cutter. You have the blonde, pretty dominant girl, the shy, pretty nerdy girl, the manly, pretty basketball star...Well. Everyone is pretty. That must be some high school. And there are no 'real people' there. Sure, you have skaters...but where are your druggies, goths, loners, or just un-snappily-dressed-kids? 'Oho!' you might say, 'Druggies on Disney Channel? But we cannot have that! They are trying their best to keep kids from experiencing real life as it is! You can't just insert goths and druggies and un-snappily-dressed-kids into Disney Channel!' And in that, you're right. Why show kids what high school is really like if you can keep masking reality forever? If you support this idea, High School Musical is for you. Keep on dreaming of that world where schools are full of pretty, happy, snappily-dressed kids, where all important games are won, all important shows go on, and the catchy, poppy songs just never stop.",2006
9,"Very well played, production smooth. I think one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. The fact that their are so many talented Young Adults with a future ahead of them. They got a lot coming towards them. Perfect story line, it shows some drama, great climax point during the story. The filming was excellent. Music writers for the song has great ambition and strong, and moving. Check out the movie on Disney channel. I think the movie was well played because not only that beautiful actors were in the movie, is that because the director Kenny Ortega has been experience through all his other shows. In the movie Choreography takes a big factor into the dancing scenes. One thing that they forgot was to put more background into the 2 main characters, played by Zac and Vanessa. They should of added more about their family's, and where their from but otherwise it was amazing. I highly recommend this movie to anyone out there, if you love music, beautiful actors, great choreography this movie is meant for you!",2006
10,"This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric ""L"" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected ""Kira"" or ""Killer"" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, ""Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper,"" but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.",2007
10,"After watching the first six episodes, I find that the story line is very well though out. Unlike many series, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the watcher, and one can never predict what is about to happen. ",2006
10,"This show just keeps getting better and better! Every episode has a new twist, and is never the same as the last! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you will watch it again and again! The story is centered around a young man, Yagami Raito/Light who finds a ""Death Note"". I won't tell you anymore about this ""Death Note"" (as that would spoil it). With this ""Death Note"" he sets about ridding the world of evil and creating a ""Utopia"", with himself as the new god. Filled with interesting characters, lots of intelligent dialouge and exiting plot twists, this show is definitely on my top 10! I would Highly recommend it to anyone, those who enjoy crime/psychological/dark themes.",2007

10,"I have seen many anime but few compare to Death Note. It provides it's viewers with incredible characters, a deep storyline, and view of how power can corrupt. The focus of the story is on Yagami Light, a college student who is feed-up with what he considers a rotting world. He soon finds a notebook named ""Death Note."" The instructions state that any human whose name is written in the Death Note will die as long as the person who writes the victim's name has the victim's face in mind at that time. While Light considers it to be a foolish prank, his curiosity gets the best of him. Upon learning that the Death Note is real, Light realizes he has the chance to rid the world of crime and create a new world over which he reigns supreme. The story of Death Note follows Light as he tries to create his new world, and the forces that try to stop him. Perhaps one of the most interesting elements of the series is that the main character is neither a hero or an anti-hero but instead an anti-villain. This an excellent series that is guaranteed to leave viewers in awe.",2007
9,"I have to say two things turned me off. First is the idiot reviewer on the front page who feels the need to use 70% of his review(even titled it ""Eat Your Heart Out Naruto""-really subtle) to bash Naruto like some insecure 12 year old spoiled brat fan boy. Pathetic. The second was that it sounded like some Gothic action anime from others. However when I finally saw it I thought, meh, okay. However as it went on I got more and more drawn in.",2007
10,"I watched one episode and thought the first episode wasn't pretty good, but when i started too watch(watching episode 11 now) i started too love it, its genius and the guy who made this movie got too be one of the smartest filmmaker ever, The animation is one of the best, the story is smart, deep and exemplary written , the characters are interesting, i can gladly say i haven't found one error in this series, so even if you don't watch much anime i just recommend you too watch this and i can swear that you will like it, i think this is as good as elfen lied(or even better). The story is about a guy named light who is top-student and smartest guy in school(without being a geek), one day some kind of diary named ''death note'' falls down from the sky and he picks it up, and then the story begins.. a must see for everyone!!!",2007
8,"In the first episode, you can already see the amazing animation, the well-chosen voices, the immediate gripping of fear over the future in your chest. Death Note is a must-see for those who love to have a good 5 minutes of thinking because Death Note beautifully weaves suspense and unexpected turn of events that leaves the audience stunned and fascinated.",2007
8,"I haven't read all the manga's, but from what I've read of the mangas and seen in the anime, this is one of the finest and truest conversions I've seen in a long time.",2007
6,"The series starts off great. There are around 5 excellently developed characters; there's a great premise; the plot develops logically and compellingly; the pacing of building tension then action is spot on. You've got a unique feel, and some moral dilemma action thought-provoking action. Everything has a balanced and cohesive feel - pretty much everything you'd expect when you see a series rated 8.9.",2013
5,"If there is one thing that Death Note has, it's a creative concept that could really lead to some very deep and interesting concepts. The show could've been deep and profound... HOWEVER it has nothing to say. While this isn't always bad, it just means this show is nothing but pointless entertainment. There is nothing truly unique about the show because it doesn't take the extra step to actually have a point.",2014
5,"I just watched all the 37 episodes after some friends recommended the series. I am not sure why I watched them all, to be honest. Really unlikable characters, same things happening over and over again, with some rare twists that are not even that brilliant. I am completely ignorant of the anime world, and this might be considered good. But it never happened to me to be so utterly indifferent about the main characters (especially after the time jump). So watch it if you really don't have anything better to do, or if you really like egocentric and self-loving, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous characters who try to defeat ""mistrerious"" and brooding ones by ""manipulating"" an army of weak and stupid (by the main character's own definition) ones.",2016
5,"I am a fan of animes and I watch diverse varieties of them, mostly the the ones with the highly praised. So, I decided to watch Death Note. Everyone was talking about how geniusly written it is, how great is the battle of two of the greatest minds, how it is suspenseful etc...",2011
7,"I checked out Death Note because I had seen a couple of episodes on Adult Swim way back and had been intrigued by the premise but never caught it from the beginning and wanted to see what all the hype was about. While the series is entertaining and wasn't necessarily a waste of my time, it fell short from being a masterpiece for me for several reasons.",2014
9,"One of the best anime ever. Light is a sort of ""Walter White"" from ""Breaking Bad"". He is the protagonist and the antagonist at the same time. He wants to reach something good by playing an evil game. At the beginning we can see a normal boy who wants to create a new better world, but after L's death, we can see a change in Light's personality. He becomes more cruel and without consciousness. He can kill everyone who stands in his way, even his family. L is one of the best anime characters I've ever seen. His abnormality makes him a man without feelings who only wants to play a game. He is not even frightened by the possibility of loosing his own life. This two characters keep the world in an equilibrium that breaks after L's death. L and Light also share a mutual respect for each other knowing that only they know the truth. They could have been friends or even lovers, regarding the fact that they both never felt something for girls (I know it's a stupid thing to say, but maybe it's true), if not for the Death Note. While now the only thing they can do is to hate each other. That's because, as L said, they are both childish and hate to lose.",2016
10,"Absolute pure F****** brilliance. I wont lie, my knowledge of anime is not great and this is one of the few I have seen, and, embarrassingly enough, I haven't even seen Akira (please don't hurt me Anime fans). However, when I watched Death Note, I am more captivated than almost any other movie or show on lately. I got the first 4 episodes on Disc about 4 weeks ago, and now I am up to Episodes 14-16, and I am still captivated. The stories are extremely complex and multi-layered with great discusser issues to it, and great characters. Nobody ever feels safe, you honestly believe anyone of them could die at any turn, and the stories are very well paced, thought out and believable. Another great part of the series is the Music, the music works very well and gives you a early feeling of the type of show you are witnessing. Also, the animation is very top rate, it looks brilliant and is very convincing. The introduction of L, of Misa and Rem, of the Universitie episodes where Light and L meet, the whole issue of both Kira's, the story gets better and better, and each episode whets your appetite for more. It would be interesting to see how it would have been if this was a Live-Action series, but then again, don't look a gift-horse in the mouth. Truly brilliant series, and deserves recognition all over the world.",2007
10,"Well, A friend is mine told my about this new anime series called Death Note. So i got my hands on the first few episode and i was completely blown away. Im actually not that anime freak and i don't watch TV series at all, but this one really got me. The Story begins with a young man finding a book, which kills people once their name has been written down in it. Using the note to purge the world from criminals he soon has to use it to remain undiscovered. Because after the police found out that there is one man killing other people on purpose they try to find him with the help of a genius profiler named L. ",2006
10,"WOW. Death Note might very well be the very best TV shows I have ever seen. The anime is very well made also. It has a very intellectual side to it, because you never know who is gonna win the battle. Death Note presents a contest of wits between Light Yagami, who can kill criminals from the privacy of his bedroom, and the detectives seeking his identity, who know only that criminals are dying under mysterious circumstances and that they too might be killed from afar if their identities become known. As a psychological thriller, the action of this series is almost entirely mental or conversational, as each antagonist attempts to out-think the other: taking risks which might reveal their enemies' identities, or expose their own. Also interesting are the many moral quandaries the series poses. MUST WATCH!",2008
6,"The series and its premises is really exciting, but this series has the same problem I feel many anime series has, too many episodes. ",2015
10,"I saw it only because I didn't have anything else to do, and till this day I am glad that I did.",2014
9,"Needless to say that I was never an anime person, and when friends were talking about it I loose interest. I kept hearing about Death Note and because they are short episodes I took the time to engage. WOW!!! in only 20 min. I was hooked and each episode keeps getting better. ",2014
7,"I have to admit that at the beginning I was not sure whether watch it or not, it took me more than a year to encourage myself about taking the decision to have a little time off to watch the entire series, it may sound dramatic to you but that's how it is, during this time, I had read and heard great comments about this anime, a lot people saying how a masterpiece this anime is and so. I have never felt the obligation to follow people's advises or 'recommendations' but there have been times when you have to be honest to agree with people's opinion. Unfortunately this was not the case.",2010
9,"""Death Note"" is simply one of the best anime series from the recent years, having an outstanding animation, very interesting characters and a magnificent plot, filled with many unpredictable and surprising plot twists, keeping a high level of tension from the beginning until the ending of the story.",2012
10,If you have not seen this show. Watch it. From the ridiculousness and brilliance of L's character to the the insane yet genius calculations of Light this show will make you question society's idea of right and wrong and what it would be like to have the power to make change happen before your very eyes. The show is thought-provoking but if you dislike intellectually oriented shows this may not be for you. Anyway 10/10 would watch again. ,2017
9,"As a science-fiction fan, long time lover of B-grade fun and a playwright who loves the idea of a small town with big secrets -- this is right up my alley. The characters either make or break a show like this, and in this case, the actors and their characters bring the entire story up. For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm. Many things I assume will be happening. As I was watching, I kept saying, where's the villain?? And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages. Ratings are King and just because it's good doesn't mean it will last. So fan boys gravitate to this show on Tuesdays on the best channel on the planet -- sci-fi!!",2006
9,"A delightful blend of humor and sci-fi, this is the kind of original programming SciFi channel is known for. Like the Stargate series and the late, lamented FarScape, the cast features a sardonic yet pragmatic hero with a little too much baggage, along with a cast of quirky geniuses, and a nefarious plot to steal top-secret military plans (are there any other kind?). The outstanding cast, featuring the wonderful Joe Morton and the under-appreciated Maury Chaikin, manages to bring energy and panache to what could have easily become formulaic. It's good to see Debra Farantino return to sci-fi as well (raise your hand if you miss ""Earth 2""). The premise offers endless variations on a theme, and the only foreseeable problems are a stereotypically heavy-handed military antagonist and a preponderance of absent-minded professor types. If the show can steer clear of overexposing these characters, or give them a twist or two, then Eureka is an excellent addition to SciFi's increasingly vivid and original programming.",2006
9,"Eureka is never going to be remembered as a ""classic"" or ""groundbreaking"" SF show. It could, however, be remembered as one of the more charming and offbeat SF shows to come along in a while. It is a bit slippery to classify, but my best description of ""Eureka"" is kind of ""Northern Exposure"" for SF fans.",2006
10,"Excellent cast of veritable unknowns. I really like Colin Ferguson in the role of the sheriff and there are enough other interesting characters that they could go many different ways with plots and story lines. I was surprised at how they have added so many twists so far to the show, being that it is about a town of scientists. You would think they could only go so far with this theme, but the writers are doing a great job of keeping it exciting and fresh so far. They have also added a great human element to the show, dealing with the sheriff and his relationship with his daughter, Zoe. And you gotta love his house! If you are a sci-fi fan and you haven't seen it yet, catch up!",2006
8,"LOL. I know. The title of this post is too clich√©, but I couldn't resist. In any case, I found the pilot of ""Eureka"" to be totally refreshing. The makers of the show took issues and aspects of long standing science fiction, added a new twist and location, and a ton of humour, creating in the process a fun new show that both amuses and mystifies.",2006
9,"This is a great little show to originate on such a small network. I've watched it since the debut and there hasn't been a bad episode yet. They all have been good. The writing is very good, and so is the execution. There are a number of veteran actors in this, including Colin Furguson, whose really good as the reluctant sheriff of the town of Eureka. Eureka is very eccentric little town (they don't say what state), apparently designed as a haven for cutting edge, and eccentric, scientists. The characters are well drawn, so you find yourself caring what happens to them. It's a good combination of science fiction, and light humor. Furguson anchors all the actors, and is a source of a lot of the humor.",2006
9,"I'm not a gamer and I am not a reality fan, but I am a big fan of real science fiction. This show actually allows you to think of the possibilities presenting interesting scientific ""what ifs"". However, it's great entertainment for various ages and IQs. I thought the characters were also introduced and developed quite nicely along with the story, something you don't see very often in many movies of this genre today, and so many of which, I can't get through the first half hour without feeling bored and changing the channel. This show will keep me coming back for more, if following episodes prove as interesting as this one. It does have a lot of promise. I like the way the main character brings the grounded ""regular guy"" comments and common sensibility to the show. Having worked around rocket scientists, they can send us into space, but you don't want them to drive your car. I agree with another reviewer, it does remind you of ""American Gothic"", because of the character development, sort of an ""American Gothic"" meets ""Star Trek Next Generation"". Hopefully, they will continue with this group of characters and not dilute it with a constant onslaught of new characters like ""Farscape"" - if you missed a few episodes, it was as though the entire cast changed. I have high hopes and will be easy to find on Tuesday night.",2006
9,"I watched the pilot twice to make sure I hadn't missed anything. The characters are exactly that; characters. Each week the actor(s) using the script brings more out in the character making the episode something to look forward to. The science fiction is well written and looks like it can be extended into reality someday. In my opinion that is what makes good sci fi. So much of what was written in the past has come true or is coming true in our lifetime. The special effects are well thought out and presented. The plots combine sci fi with humanity and the continuity from week to week is present but does not make the viewer feel that they are watching a soap opera and have to watch the next episode in order to find out what is going to happen. Still, I look forward to each episode to find out how the over all story is going to evolve. This appears to be a program with staying powers.",2006
7,"I think this is a series that will grow on you as you watch it. The characters build up and the show is entertaining to me. This show rolls up the science fiction that I watched growing up only on a more sophisticated level. I like the series so fare. I hope that it will last more than one season. However, because I like it means it probably wont last. you will have to watch it for yourself. It has been better than watching re-runs on the traditional channels which aren't worth watching. The characters are very interesting and I wonder who is on the 'bad' side for the series. This also has some elements of dark comedy.",2006
7,"The idea is interesting and gives the writers a world of opportunities, although they could have found a better explanation for Eureka and some parts were a little too odd and stereotyped (i.e. the guy getting off at a DNA).",2006
10,"Quite original, thoughtful, and well written series with a uniformly excellent cast. Each episode is a delight and the characters grow and develop as the series progresses. It is one of the more witty shows on television yet it also tackles some important issues as well. Cable television has become a haven for creative and talented people blocked from network expression due to the reality series craze. This is a perfect example of a creative work that has found a home on cable. Well-produced science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously and still leaves the viewer with much to think about. It is interesting to see how important relationships are in this series and those are often much more important than plot and the sci-fi angle.",2007
9,"Twelve episodes of (almost) unalloyed joy. The pilot film (episodes 1 and 2) set such a high standard that little could live up to it but most episodes did. Jack Carter is the perfect everyman; that is, if everyman were a US Marshall. The back-story of the new sheriff is skillfully sketched while his daughter is superbly cast and acted. Each eccentric character melds with the brilliant insanity of the town called Eureka with its security envied by Area 51. The premise is both patently absurd and close enough to a paranoid conspiracy freak's suspicions (What is in 5?) of reality that it can charmingly conjure up almost any plot imaginable. Seeing scenes of Ladysmith (and Hope?) BC filling in for Eureka adds an extra bit of enjoyment for a westerner. Ferguson's knowing ""hmm"" is always amusing. How so many emotions in the face of absurdity can be contained in a single inarticulate sound is quite wonderful. When all is taken into account, Eureka stands or falls on the quality of the writing and the writing has been generally excellent. Then there is the theme: original, memorable and lightly haunting. I sincerely hope that another season follows. ""Eureka"" always makes me smile.",2007
4,"In spite of the entirely unbelievable premise, antique B-movie formula plots, tired characterizations and a droolingly idiotic presentation of science, ""Eureka"" undeniably has charm. The charm is almost entirely reliant on an excellent cast, which against all odds has managed to invest this (literal and figurative) farce with warmth and plausible emotional engagement. However, in the latest season (2009)even those lightweight justifications for existence have disappeared.",2009
10,"I'm not big on leaving comments on IMDb, but I registered so I could leave this one. Eureka is a show no true geek or lovers of geek (or technology in general) should miss. That is my own personal view of course, but the show's humor, plot and interpersonal relationships are all tied in very well. I love watching the show for the suspenseful moments, and the ones that break out of the norm for a moment to show us something truly different. Time and space have been covered on Star Trek and other Sci Fi programs, but I'm a big fan of this show because it's all in current-day terms. The town of Eureka looks like a cozy mountain town (something I can relate to where I grew up) and has that ""just want to go home"" feeling to it.",2006
7,"What a great premise for a show. A secret city full of the best minds in the world brought together to work for the advancement of science. Add eccentric scientists, experiments gone wrong, an outsider for a Sheriff, and for a touch of romance, introduce a love triangle that includes the three main players. Sounds like some adventure could come from such a premise, doesn't it? I especially like the characters. Each possesses a set purpose or talent and each has his or her own eccentricities that are just fun to watch. The actors do an amazing job playing off of each other. You'll find comedy throughout so much of the show that often has its dark moments. And you can't talk about Eureka and not talk about the special effects. They are very well done and certainly enhance the viewers perception of this other world, a world where technology is both good and evil. I certainly enjoy watching it play out each week!",2006

The best episode bar far had to be S.A.R.A.H, when the poor sheriff's house turned bad! I swear i will be forever using the word INVISIBLING from now on, its a classic little piece of English language, which lets face it, can only be used to its full comedic value in a room full of genius science people who are more than willing to point out any mistake. Im not usually one for this type of programme, but good god A Town Called Eureka is amazing! It takes an awful lot to keep me interested in television programmes, and this programme had it all for me. All i want to know is if a second series planned and when will it hit our screens here in sunny old england!",2007

3,"This series was recommended to us and seemed to get high scores here and other places, so we thought we'd give the first episode a try. It started out with some potential for being cool, but it quickly devolved into a series of caricatures, quirkiness for the sake of being cute (though not funny), and silly science. Things move along at such a rapid pace with the main character's interactions with the oddballs in the town that it makes no sense. One minute he's an outsider, poison darted and thrown in the clink, the next he's a valued part of the team, getting his security clearance, and joshing around like he's known them forever. It's quite a stretch. I value believability in a show (yes, even one like this), and combined with the heavy-handed attempts at quirkiness, it just left me thinking it was dumb. And anyone who is into science or, well, top secret government facilities will really think so. If they had toned down the attempts to be cute and made it a serious show, they would have made a better show in my opinion. Cute and smart isn't easy!",2008

The characters, situations, story arc, all moving forward. In addition, the actors are growing into their parts and seem to work well together. Many small creative touches make this incredible situation seem almost real. (I noticed a bit too much ""techno-babble"" in this weeks episode, but oh well).Keep it going! I really look forward to each new episode. Sure it is a bit frothy, nothing too deep, but the characters and uniqueness of the situations are fun and entertaining.

9,"OK, I only got through the first 3 pages of comments but let me add my own. ",2006
9,"I've seen this film and let me tell everyone that it was one of the most pleasurable surprises I've ever had with a film. I hadn't heard about it before and it totally took me by surprise. It blew me away and left me speechless. The acting is excellent by most of the actors, but Michael Caine deserves to receive a special mention for his amazing portrait of the old hippie Jasper. His performance is fantastic and he totally stole the show in the scenes he was in. Claire Hope is also fantastic in the role of Kee. Her performance is quite impressive, especially considering this is one of her first films. Clive Owen is also great as the reluctant hero who sees his life turned upside down and is given a huge responsibility. I've seen him in some other films and he's at his best here. A very good performance, you could feel what he was going through. In the technical aspects the film was brilliant, particularly Alfonso Cuar√≥n's strong and consistent direction that is one of the best things in the film, and contributes a lot to its quality. Also director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki does wonders with images and there are some extremely beautiful shots all done in a naturalistic way, natural lighting, etc. It's an extremely well crafted film that makes you go through the emotional struggle the characters go through and makes you feel that you're in the middle of it all. Besides, it's also an extremely touching story that certainly touched my heart. One of the best films I've ever seen without any doubt.",2006
10,"I've had a particularly bad film year, especially after having seen one particular over-hyped vacuous mess earlier in the year which all but killed my desire to see any films, no matter how interesting they looked or what the critics said about them. So, it was with a little trepidation that I went to see this, especially given that it starred Clive Owen (IMHO, the George Lazenby of British acting).",2006
9,"Alfonso Cuaron has given us a very clever rendering of a very English dystopian novel. P D James, the ""Baroness of Bad"" is famous for her well-written and absorbing police procedural novels (""Inspector Dalgliesh"") but in the early 90s she produced a vision of a world only 20 years into the future in which for unspecified reasons all the women on earth have become infertile and no babies have been born for the last 18 years.",2006
5,"I have to say I was shocked to find how mediocre I thought this film was. I mean people who I trust about movies loved it -- the people who raved about Million Dollar Baby, or Eastern Promises, or Amores Perros.",2008
10,"Of all the visions of the future movie audiences have been treated to over the past few years, the world of Children of Men may be the most frightening and allegorically effective yet.",2006
9,"This year I attended for the first time the Venice Film Festival in Italy. I was of course quite excited and bought tickets to some screenings of a few different films I found interesting. Initially Children of Men wasn't in my plans but I was convinced by a friend who was very enthusiastic about it. Now I say I'm glad I bought the tickets! What an amazing film this is. The science fiction genre is just a coat to project into the future the horrors and problems of our current days and many films attempt that ending up, in most cases, failing. This one however succeeds. Succeeds indeed but not only in this... The film blew away nearly everyone in the audience as one of the best action movies we have seen lately, with extremely exciting and brutal chases, gun fights, etc. Don't be put off by this though, the film is as good as it is not because of the action sequences but its amazingly emotional and touching story. The performances of the cast is impressive especially Clive Owen and the newcomer Claire Hope Ashitey who throughout the film develop the relationship between their characters and it's such a joy to see the development. I'm not very good at writing reviews so I think I'll stop know, but I had at least to transmit something to everyone who might be interested in watching this film. Don't pass this one, you won't regret it. In my view one of the few excellent films released this year.",2006
6,"After reading various reviews and seeing the previews, I was quite excited to see ""Children of Men"". Upon viewing the movie, however, I was unable to see why users were rating it so highly. I believe there is a predilection to highly rate any Futuristic Dystopia, as they graphically transport us to a time that we are ever so interested in -- our not-too-distant future. ""Children of Men"" does this better than most, since -- with the exception of the infertility theme -- it does not highly disconnect us from what our future is likely to be.",2007
1,"It is hard to believe that the movie we saw tonight is the same as the one praised here on this website. Where is the intrigue? Where is the view of a world that is tormented with the knowledge of being barren? Where are the deep insights into a 'very possible future'? All I saw was a simple chase movie that was obviously done differently compared to what we are usually dished by the likes of Hollywood but also one that not for second convinced me. Worse yet, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this fake and contrived. ",2008
3,*** This review contains HUGE SPOILERS for the movie AND THE BOOK ***,2007
6,"I was really looking forward to this movie . I do like British dystopian / apocalyptic movies which have been in vogue for the last few years , think 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER , V FOR VENDETTA etc and CHILDREN OF MEN was very well regarded by the critics even picking up a couple of Bafta awards and three Oscar nominations . Three Oscar nominations for a dystopian apocalyptic movie ! This means it's gotta be a great movie right ? Unfortunately it's not ",2009
6,"A frustratingly uneven film, with a perplexing mixture of strengths and weaknesses, reflected in its very divergent ratings here. As an exercise in visualising the near future it is compelling and convincing. It is easy to believe that grotty, disintegrating world it shows is just how it will be, and the few futuristic gadgets around are all the more convincing because of the otherwise mundane and grungy setting. Despite the dismal greyness of this world, the film still has a strange sort of visual beauty, and there is an energy and fluidity in the images that are presented.",2007
9,"Worthy addition to a very British literary, televisual and cinematic tradition of dystopian and apocalyptic narratives. H.G Wells, John Wyndham, SURVIVORS, 28 DAYS LATER.",2006
1,Unbelievable what I read about this movie! I don't have one single positive comment to make about it since during the entire movie I only contemplated whether to leave or see it through hoping to see it turn for the better and at least get my money's worth.,2007
5,"Set in a slightly futuristic world filled with racial hatred and terrorism, a former activist (Clive Owen) takes up the task to escort to safety the first pregnant woman in 18 years. He has to battle through extreme situations with danger lurking around every corner of a war-weary England.",2007
1,"This film seems to have received incredible high praise and is currently listed in the Top250 of this website. I hate to fly in the face of such adoration, but this film left me completely indifferent and rather irritated if not highly annoyed. Sure, there are a few nice setpieces, but it's all set against a hack-handed background rendering them only a mild distraction from the otherwise continuous amazement at the film's triteness and mindboggling illogical plotpoints. The film is poorly structured and almost entirely if not completely un-engaging with the most lame and sappy ending I have ever seen to a film. ",2008
1,I'm confused. Very much so even...,2007
4,"This well directed first rate production can't overcome the film's pretense that it is ""deep"" or ""meaningful""; in fact, for all it's production value, the movie is, at its core, meritricious. Those reading the astonishing number of positive reviews beware--this is a classic example of viewers bringing preconceived expectations to a movie and then agreeing with their own pre-assessments even though the film they watched sorely missed the mark. At heart, the story is simple: the world has been infertile for unknown reasons for 18 years. As a result, everyone is in a bad mood for the entire film, except Michael Caine, who looks like a refugee from the 60's, growing marijuana, and giving avuncular advice to Clive Owen while getting high. Clive Owen, one of our great actors, is perfectly cast as an angry man working at a meaningless job while an apparent perpetual riot is ongoing in London, the last of the world's major cities not to have been destroyed. Ener Julianne Moore, divorced for 20 years from Mr. Owen. Nonetheless, she has him kidnapped to assist in a critical mission--the delivery to safety of a Young black woman (symbolically and obviously named Kee) who is about to have the world's first infant (obviously a woman) in nearly two decades. While one could think of twenty important issues raised by the premise of the film (religious, social, philosophical, etc.) the great failure of the film is that is doesn't deal with any of them--content to watch Owen scowl, Caine fart and various lunatics babble in foreign tongues. In any event, Owen undertakes this mission and effectively delivers the mother and child to safety. Left behind, however, is a nightmare of war, riot, lunacy, rival factions, and general mayhem. Are we supposed to believe that the birth of one child will transmogrify the ""end of days"" world she's born into? Who knows and who cares? The director's job is to make the issues surface--and not supply a story from which we can create our own meaning. As far as I'm concerned, the film was an equivalent of a blank canvass and the viewers are supposed to supply meaning to it. This ain't art history, it's film. In the end, I couldn't help comparing this film to Sam Mendes great failure ""Road to Perdition""; while it was technically superior, it painted a small story on a big canvas and, ultimately, had nothing to say to me. Potential viewers are on notice!",2007
7,I think that your opinion of this film is going to greatly depend on your expectations beforehand. It seems that a lot of people went to see this film not expecting much and were pleasantly surprised by its intelligence and non-derivative execution.,2010
8,"this film is one of the best things i have seen this year. It's an improbable cross between ""Brazil"" ""a clockwork orange"" and the video game HALF-LIFE2 (from which it borrows it's final sequences and use of on shot action-sequences) it manages to be both entertaining in the Hollywood way (with incredible action sequences and a very clever way of using digital effects) yet very sad and different with a very very dark and realistic overtone. No comic relief, no cartoon character bravery, only human behavior in it's best and most horrible way. This realistic overtone makes the main characters very engaging and moving. CLive owen (whose i have always disliked) is excellent as the man drowned into an adventure too big for him (sorry for my bad English)",2006

10,"Rocky Balboa (2006) is truly the best Rocky Movie since Rocky III and IV, maybe the best of all time!! Still the first movie is the best, Rocky Balboa is close to the first film, the best movie in the series of all time! It is my second favorite best film In the series. I love this movie to death the same as I love Rocky I,III and IV to death! in my opinion it is better than new movie Creed! For me Rocky IV will be the best in the series. This movie brings closure to the ultimate sports movie. This movie showed the true essence of who Rocky was and what he was all about. The film has a heart unlike Rocky V who did not had a heart. The most that I love In this film is, the training sequence. The film is fast paced, entraining, not boring or over too long. It truly follows the roots from the first Rocky film, it is a 30.year anniversary after the success of the first Rocky film from the 70's. I love how Rocky meets little Marie (Geraldine Hughes) after 30.years and everything what Rocky predicted in the first film, really happened to her. Tony Duke (Tony Burton) did return in this film. There is no Adrian (Talia Shire) in this film, I am happy she wasn't in here. I heard something that Stallone did not cast her in the film, because she wanted much more money. ",2015
10,Guys...,2006
10,"I recently attended a pre-screening for ""Rocky Balboa"" in Denver. This movie was so powerful, that I went through every emotion imaginable while watching it. There are some very humorous parts in the movie, there are some sad parts of the movie. However, the message of the film is moving. This particular ""Rocky"" movie focuses on Rocky's life after boxing. It really develops his character in ways that the other movies have not. The trailer that is out does not do this movie justice. If you want to see a movie with a deep message and a whole lot of heart, you will not be disappointed. Don't think ""Another 'Rocky' movie"" and brush it off. This movie is well written, the acting is great, the characters seem like real people. Even though I have already seen it, I will be back on opening day to see it again. It is an instant classic. So keep an open mind and give this movie a chance, you will be glad that you did!",2006
10,Balboa is gonna hit so many people in different ways.,2006
10,"I just attended an advance screening of Rocky Balboa. This film is a truly beautiful character piece that deserves tremendous praise. For those of you who have written off Sylvester Stallone as an actor - you are in for a re-awakening of his talent. The writing is phenomenal as is the truly inspirational feeling you will get watching this - much like the first Rocky movie. Stallone wore three hats during the filming as screenwriter, director and star. Burt Young makes a terrific return as Paulie. Another highlight is Geraldine Hughes as Marie. Personally, I couldn't have hoped for a better conclusion to this legacy Sylvester Stallone has left for American culture known as ""Rocky Balboa.""",2006
10,"Had the opportunity last night to see the World Premier of Rocky Balboa two months before it will be released. A great movie. I was impressed with it, in fact the storyline is something we will all appreciate. I am looking all over the internet right now to see if I can find the two speeches Rocky gives in the movie, that gave me chills. One was to the commission, when he tries to get his boxing license, and the other to his son. The acting is great, the storyline as stated before is great, the cast is well put together as well. This is Stallone's best acting ever. The only downfall, I thought was the soundtrack, as Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) entrance music to the fight is great, and of course the theme to Rocky is great, but other than that the soundtrack was not good at all. However as we all know we cannot judge a movie by its soundtrack. This is a must see!",2006
10,"I saw this film at a test screening a few months ago. While I am a fan of all the films I think this one is the most on par with the first one. While two thru five were good films they had more to do with Rocky as a public figure and his fame. In this film he is not that distanced from the guy he was in the first, maybe just a little wiser. The film doesn't focus so much on boxing as it does on the actual character of Rocky and the trials he faces having one day been on top of the world and now he leads a simple life and thrives on his memories.",2006
9,"I had the opportunity to see a screening of this movie. Having been thoroughly disappointed with Rocky five, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I am very happy to say this movie brings the Rocky series to the rightful close that the fifth left so empty. This movie isn't so much about the boxing itself, but getting back to the roots of the Rocky story...that determination and courage with the love and help of others makes Rocky a winner no matter what.",2006
10,Now this is how you put to bed the greatest underdog story ever told. ,2006
7,"I've been able to see this before it's release date so I'll avoid giving too much away in this review. To start with when I heard that they were going to make a sixth Rocky movie you didn't have to be a die hard fan to wonder what were they thinking about, particularly 15 years after the last horrible outing! After 30 years since the original ROCKY was released one could only wonder what else they could conjure up after such a long hiatus? Yet this movie was not bad and it's important to stress that on a number of levels. This rendition of Rocky is true to the previous ones as again he is the underdog, a former champ who is encouraged to come out of obscurity and take on the current champ despite having been retired for 20 years.",2006
10,"This movie was worth waiting for! It is full of life lessons - all worthwhile for people of all ages. This movie touches your every sense. It made me feel as good as I did after watching the 1st Rocky years ago - hopeful, grateful - it made me believe in myself & others!",2006
10,"I don't normally go out of my way to send out reviews of movies...but I have to say if you haven't seen Rocky Balboa yet...you MUST! First of all, it is rated PG...and it actually was....I mean, I didn't have to worry about hiding my children's eyes because of a gratuitous...whatever...ya know? Okay---so, It was THE BEST film I've seen in a long time...since...geez...maybe since...I don't know...maybe since Braveheart! If Stallone is ignored or doesn't win an Oscar for this movie, I'll never watch, vote for or speak of the awards again. The film harkened back to the original with a great script and character development...I can't say enough about the writing. Do you remember how the first one made you feel? Like you were in the life of the characters in Philadelphia? The simple wisdoms and UNscripted feeling you got...that which was lost in the later films...just great language. Stallone's acting was fantastic...yes...that's right...Stallone can act! In fact, Stallone wasn't there...just Rocky. This character has lived in Stallone so long, there wasn't anything or way in which Sly didn't know exactly how Rocky would feel or move or think...total character. Burt Young who plays ""Paulie"" was great as well, showing how all the crap he's dealt out over the years has haunted the character in very deep ways...along with quirky character habits and some surprises that are presented in such a tertiary way that you walk away from the film and only later giggle about them because you didn't realize it at first...like a relative in your own family...like, ""eh--that's just Pualie..."" only realizing later, ""Wait, I'm not related to Paulie...no one is!"" lol. Old characters are integrated into this film so smoothly and without pomp as to crate a fluidity between the first and last film that seems effortless for the audience. For example, does anyone remember the references in the first film to ""Spider Rico"" or who said, ""Screw you, Creepo!"" ??? These little things are tugged out of our memory like a childhood pal and brought to the fore of this film in way in which the familiarity brings a smile to your face. The clothes are great. Just pay attention to Rocky's suit coat. This is not an action movie...so those of you that want to see the Stallone blowing stuff up, should rent Rambo III (A great social commentary in its own way). But for those of you who like STORY and CHARACTER, you will love this film. And here is how broad the films appeal was, I went to see it with my 4 year old, Meadhbh, and she loved it. We've both been humming the theme song since we saw it. It took me all night, thinking about the script to realize the deep social commentary that Stallone has made with this film. There is much on how each one of us can affect changes that reach our far beyond our own lives, how we've lost that which made us great as a nation when we would connect with each other by making the most of what we can in our own little part of the world. Like, buying from local merchants and grocers, restaurateurs and retailers, instead of Mega stores, employing people from character rather than qualification (showing them the ropes and mentoring, instead of always hiring ready made employees), the inter-dependence we have on foreign workers and the GOOD balance that can create... the need for a man (in the case of the film) or a woman to work for self-esteem, pride for what you can do with your own hand, not taking the easy way or accepting handouts because you feel like the world owes you something...how having love is so, so precious and ...and how we should express and acknowledge that fact every day to those whom we love and who love us...how we cannot live by mere existence, that we MUST be challenged and if we are not, we must make challenges for ourselves that may seem unattainable...I'm not talking about conflict, rather, the defiance of complacency...There is an overall theme about how we should, and can, conduct ourselves in the world, everyday, in every way that is so gently presented as to not offend or feel forced. Rather it is given as a gift, a reminder of our better selves...even for those that are living that better path, it is a confirmation and reassurance that those actions, though never easy, are righteous. The movie is so good to look at and conversations so great to listen to, you almost forget that the movie has to end with the big fight. But then the music comes in...but then that trumpet comes in and when THE music kicks in, the whole audience was yelling, ""Yeah! Go Rock! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"" When was the last time you heard the audience engaged with a film at all? I sometimes feel like I'm in a theatre with the walking dead, where nothing goes on between the screen and the seats, no one leaves the theatre talking about the film. People left this movie smiling, crying, punching the air, doing the Rocky, victory at the top of the stairs dance...it was awesome!",2006
10,"Admit it. The first time you heard this movie was being made, you either laughed or cringed. On the surface, the concept of a sixth ROCKY film is one of the most ludicrous in recent memory. A brain-damaged boxer who hasn't fought in two decades comes out of retirement in his 50s? To take on the Heavyweight champ? Come on.",2007
9,"I highly recommend seeing this movie if you liked the first Rocky. I went and saw it Christmas Day 2006 with my father and sister. My father had seen the first Rocky back in 1976 and loved it. The new Rocky had that same emotion like the first one. People were in the theater making fun of Rocky saying, ""Oh, so when is Rocky XIX coming out?!"" ""Come on you old man!"" But I think anybody who liked the story and could relate to it would actually walk out of the theater and say, "" That was a darn good movie"" It had a lot of the silent sort of scenes where that early morning Philadelphia song would come in. GO SEE IT! RENT IT! YOU WILL LIKE IT! ",2007
9,"In Rocky V Mr. Balboa moves back to his home town, Phillydelphia because of lack of money. Now he lives in a small house for himself. In 2002 Adrian died, which, of course broke Rocky's heart.

And he only get jobs because he is the son of Rocky.",2007
10,WoW... Just saw this movie and it was Awesome...,2007
7,"Sylvester Stallone completes his Rocky Epic with a stirring conclusion. I saw a special sneak preview in Detroit at a Kronk Boxing Gym benefit. Although the first 45 minutes kind of dragged, and at times the dialog made me cringe, its at least as worthy of Rocky II or the original Rocky. A lot of flashbacks, but it definitely wraps up the series a lot better than Rocky V did. It won't win best picture, or any great acting awards, but the cinematography was better than I've seen in a lot of the previous 5. As far as the big question in the blogs, does Rocky die in this one, you'll have to wait till Christmas and see for yourself. The music was great, the final scenes were great, and Paulie was great! It was also interesting to reintroduce the characters of Little Marie and Spider Rico from the first movie.",2006
10,"Wow, this was not what I was expecting!",2007
9,"This new ROCKY is a truly fitting finale to the saga of Rocky Balboa. Always likable, usually stirring and entertaining (of course, I'm not acknowledging there was a Rocky V), this version has replaced macho with heart. In a glorious, pitch perfect performance of a revered Champ in the twilight of a now lonely, unfulfilled life, Stallone is actually amazing. I didn't think he still had this kind of heartfelt performance in him. He has written, directed and performed this work with the insight of a person who has endured all the ups and downs that a career can experience.",2006
9,"From the Start of this film i knew Rocky Balboa was going to be a great film, this film continues his life with the loss of Rocky's wife and his son all grow up, Rocky Balboa is a drama and mainly about his life as he gets older. ",2007
10,"(before I logged in here)I had never commented a movie on an overseas website (since I'm a Chinese in HK) (before I watched this movie)I was no Rocky fans; but what? what drives me here? by now, I don't know, the movie may no longer be available in cinemas in U.S. or Europe. But I still want to show my support (thumbsup from this overseas connection).",2007
9,"Amazingly, this is a very good movie. Rocky comes out of retirement to fight one more time. But more importantly, the movie is about dealing with change, with loss, with the irretrievable passing of time and how life goes on, no matter what happens. Rocky is more than a fighter, he is now a philosopher who observes life and the people in it. The young girl from the past is now a grown woman. The young boy who was his son is now a grown man. But despite the passage of time, Rocky is still Rocky. He is the Tevya the Milkman of Philadelphia. This movie is about not giving up, always moving forward and never looking back. And let's not forget Paulie played by Burt Young. Mr. Young offers a fabulous performance as Rocky's suffering yet indefatigable brother-in-law Paulie. Paulie is the every-man, the average Joe, the guy in the crowd who in this movie is heard. In a way, this movie is about you and me because there's a little bit of Paulie in all of us.",2007
10,"I had the privilege recently to see a very inspiring picture. It not only kept me in suspense. It kept me laughing. It had me tearing. It was what a movie is supposed to do. It moved me. I wanted to take my daughters however, they didn't want to see it. Mind you we have the previous movies but this might be the last time we can enjoy something as movie as this. I receive no money for this, but since we all need something to encourage us sometimes. We are all having trials and tribulations to overcome. I believe this is the best movie of all time that starred Sylvester Stallone. Yes I said it. It is ROCKY BALBOA. If you haven't seen it, it is worth seeing. I am 34, the first was shown in 1976. OK I admit I grew up watching him in all of the Rocky movies. And I admit I am a fan for life. But this movie in my book was all of that and a bag of chips. It is something the whole family should enjoy.",2007
10,"He must have heard everything, he must have been warned, mocked.. And yet he did it. He did it because he knew it wasn't over, because he felt he had something to prove. Because he wanted Rocky's curtain falls to be as true as his birth had been. We welcomed it as it deserved to be welcomed, with applause, with tears. This is what he wanted, and this is what we wanted. But the only thing I can regret now, is that it's truly over. Whatever people say, or may have said in the past, I think I'll always consider the Rocky Movies as a major achievement in the History of Cinema. First because it arrived at a time where people needed to believe in their dreams, and because it gave to a wonderful person, his revenge on life. Now wiser, stronger... He gave us the opportunity to read his mind again, to share his fears and aspirations, to share a real piece of life, sweat, blood and tears. This is what is Rocky to me, what is Sly.

9,"It's a pretty funny movie. You could tell Will Ferrell and Sacha Cohen (aka Ali G) and John C. Reilly all had the opportunity to improvise lines and riff on one another, and all three were pretty good.",2006
8,"This movie does something that is rarely done successfully done, pokes fun at the modern NASCAR circuit. Without detailing all the gags, this is pure fun which doesn't offend the tastes too often. Will Farrell is patently absurd as Ricky Bobby & the support he receives in this film from the entire cast is excellent. Gary Cole is very solid as Ricky's dad, & so is Jane Lynch as his mom. Amy Adams is solid too. In fact, the entire cast including John C. Reilly seems to have been fit into their roles like gloves.",2006
9,"I was lucky enough to be at a premiere in Chicago for this movie and it was pure fun entertainment. I am not a nascar fan and I love this movie. First off let me say that most of the scenes that they show in the previews are not in the movie, or are at least altered from the trailer version. The characters are extremely funny. John C. Reily and Will Farrell make a perfect red-neck match in this comedy. They play off each other and you can tell that they must have had a blast making this movie. The scene where they are saying grace around the table will, in my opinion, go down as one of the funniest scenes ever. I rank this movie right up there with other will Farrell greats like Old School, Wedding Crashers and Anchorman. So, whether you are a will Farrell fan or not, if you just enjoy fun movies that will have you laughing out loud from start to finish, than you should definitely go check this movie out when it comes out. I will be the guy in the front of the line waiting to get my ticket to see this movie again. A+",2006
7,"When looking at the merits of a movie and decide whether it is good or not, one must think of the goal of the picture. Is it a serious film, designed to comment on society, or is the movie's job to merely entertain? I think we all know the answer to this one when it comes to Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. This movie's goal is to entertain the audience, make them laugh, make them spend an hour and a half rejoicing in talented comedians doing their job well. And this movie reached its goal. Not only is this movie an above-average sports movie (it even concludes with a big race and a warm and fuzzy winner!), but is also a very funny movie. All I had to do was listen to the reaction of the sold out theater I was in and I knew that most people will find this movie to be very funny. Will Ferrell is Ricky Bobby, a NASCAR driver who makes up one half of ""Shake and Bake,"" with John C. Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. being the ""Bake"" half of the duo. They are childhood friends who have now become teammates on the top NASCAR level, where Cal sets up the play that lets Ricky win almost every race--that is, unless Ricky has already crashed out of it. Talladega Nights follows the same story arc that Days of Thunder did, but is far more entertaining, as Ferrell and Reilly work together to bring humor to all parts of the racer's lives, including a bizarre dinner ritual that includes corporate sponsorship. Sure, the movie slows down for about 20 minutes in the middle to develop plot, but that may have been designed to give us, the audience, a break, allowing us to get ready for the final scenes of the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen (aka Ali G, Borat) plays the French Formula 1 driver who threatens to oust Ricky Bobby as the best driver on the track, perhaps the funniest overall character in the movie. There is not one scene with Cohen in it that isn't funny. After watching this movie, it is clear why Will Ferrell takes his comedies so seriously (watch the extras on the Elf DVD to see Ferrell between scenes, he's not always ""on"" playing the clown on set)--he gets the results he's looking for. This movie is laugh-out-loud funny pretty much from start to finish, and seeing Gary Cole return to comedy as Ricky Bobby's father will bring back memories of Office Space for a moment, then this new character will win you over.",2006
8,"You still get plenty of fast paced action, muscle cars, and massive car crashes. You just get to laugh a lot too.",2006
10,"I liked this movie a LOT. I think it's annoying how people come on here and whine and cry about poking fun at things...boo hoo he joked about boobs or gay people or Jesus or whatever...every single comment I read was someone who didn't like it because it offended them. It's a comedy, grow up!! Of course it's going to make fun of things, what else would make it funny? I thought that this movie was HILARIOUS, I am a very big fan of Will Ferrell I can't think of one movie I seen with him in it that I didn't like! So please, if you're that easily offended, next time you wanna rent a movie, for all out sakes, DON'T pick up a comedy. GEEZ!",2007
8,"If you are a fan of Will Ferrell and Sacha Baron Cohen (from Da Ali G Show), you will love this movie. I saw it for free at a screening in LA, and I must say that I expected it to be a rental-worthy ""dumb comedy""... one of those so-stupid-it's-funny flicks that I wouldn't have paid to see at the theater. However, after seeing this film, let me tell you that I can't wait to see it again and I'd definitely say it's worth the 10 bucks to enjoy this film at the theater with a group of friends! I very rarely laugh out loud during movies (and the friend that I was with says the same thing), but we were both cracking up almost the whole time!!! You definitely don't need to be into Nascar to like this movie (I'm not). In addition to the hilarious red-neck ""dynamic duo"" of Ferrell and John C. Reily, you'll love Sacha Cohen's character, the gay French racer Jean Girard. And there are subtle social & political commentaries on America throughout the movie that made me smile! Go see for yourself when it opens in the theaters!",2006
8,"Ricky Bobby grows up to become a big-time race car driver. With the conflict of having no father to raise him, life was not always easy. And now, as an adult, he is finally ready to meet his match: a French driver from the Formula Un series. Can Ricky make him surrender? Shake and bake! I really don't want to like this film, because I think Will Ferrell is past his prime already and on his way out. The bigger a role he receives, the less likely he is to make a good movie, because he is just such a dumb actor. Popping in for a brief time (""Wedding Crashers"") is alright, but a full movie (""Elf"")? I don't know. Yet, he took the whole film here and ran with it.",2006
6,"In Talladega Nights, Will Farrell and Jon C. Reilly head a nicely assembled cast (without a lot of star power) in a story about a fool who happens to be a race car driver and who has based his entire life philosophy around a phrase uttered by his alcoholic father during a drunk - ""If you ain't first, you're last"". Ricky Bobby rides high in his largely unexamined life until, predictably, he eventually crashes hard when confronted with a gay French intellectual who just might be a better driver than he is, and a boss who does not appreciate his arrogance.",2007
8,"Two summers ago, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay teamed up for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) entered the scene. This summer, the pair re-teamed for a sort of quasi-sequel as evidenced by the colon and ""The Legend of"" in the title. Will Ferrell stars as moderately dim-witted race car driver Ricky Bobby who differs from Anchorman's protagonist Ron Burgundy in that he is a more fully-fleshed out character. His need for speed on the track is guided by a void left by his race car driving dad's (Gary Cole's) abandonment. Along for the ride is the ever-so-versatile John C. Riley as perennial sidekick Cal Naughton Jr. who literally finishes second to him in every race. He suggests to his buddy maybe, just once, he can let him win just once to which Ricky Bobby replies, ""Well I see where you're coming from but if you win, how am I gonna win."" ",2006
1,I really wanted to like this movie.,2006
9,"I don't know that I'd enjoy this movie in New York or San Francisco, but in rural West Virginia it was absolutely hilarious. ",2006
5,I absolutely love Will Ferrel but this is his weakest outing ever. Ferrel has a high budget and one of the best supporting casts of the year to work with but he doesn't take advantage of what he is given. By mid way point the movie is Anchorman with a Nascar setting and new names. Sadly Ferrel has been playing the same character for a while. There are some moments of comedic brillianceut the rest of the film doesn't work. Ferrel can actually write a decent screenplay too bad he adds bits and pieces of nonsense when he could explore his characters a little more. It frustrates me knowing that Ferrel has the talent but he can't move on from playing SNL characters.,2006
5,"I got into this movie for free because I know someone at the theater, thank god!",2006
1,"This movie is a perfect example of how the end of the world is near. I would rather stare at tree bark for 2 hours than to ever watch this worthless movie ever again. I can't believe how many people actually found this movie decent let alone label Will Ferrell a genius. Come to think of it, I don't think he's ever made me laugh. ""HELP ME BABY Jesus!"" <-- That's funny how? His acting is terrible and he acts like an idiot and other people love it. Brace yourself when you watch this movie, because you will think of all the other older funny movies that you love so much that will never be made ever again because crap like this keeps emerging to idiots all over the planet. It just goes to show you don't have to be talented, smart, or funny to be successful in Hollywood.",2007
3,i went in with high hopes - maybe that was the movie's downfall. ,2006
4,"the laughs i had were isolated moments that weren't woven together in any cohesive sense... it was like a string of a hundred unrelated jokes, and most of them were bad. i did laugh, when Ferrell and Cohen were at their best, and when Ricky Bobby's kids went off. i do admit, my laughter spiked when the little kid threatens his grandpa, ""I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!"" that was good s***.",2006
2,"This had to be by far the worst comedy of the summer, not to mention the fact that it was the worst comedy that I have ever seen. Bland dialog, one-liners of people shouting nonsense criticisms at each other, and random references to a serious sport that nobody in the audience seemed to understand as a joke filled this movie as Will Ferrell's career hits another all time low.",2006
9,"I can't explain or rationalise exactly why, but I love the absurdist humour of Will Ferrell. And Talladega Nights is right up there with Ferrell's amazing Anchorman as one of the dumbest, craziest and funniest films that I've seen.",2007
5,"I use to love Will Farrel on SNL. The guy definitely has the comic genes, Unfortunately I sat for the first twenty five minutes waiting for something to make me laugh. The premise of the movie seems to have ample room for comedy, although as someone who lived in south for many years some of the southern redneck clich√©'s get a little excessive. The odd part about this movie is that one of the funniest characters is Ricky's deadbeat dad played by Gary Cole. Cole isn't know for comedy parts in general but Reese Bobby is somebody we have probably all ran into at some point in our lives, and somebody we would avoid if we saw him coming. To be fair this movie is probably aimed at an audience a lot younger than me and although not quite as juvenile as some of the Adam Sandler movies it isn't what anyone would consider sophisticated comedy. The characters in the story including Ricky's gorgeous and opportunistic wife should come off a lot funnier. The movie does have a few funny lines but just not a lot of comic continuity. Save a few bucks a wait for the DVD.",2006
8,"After a fairly terrible year in 2005, it should come as no surprise that it took another teaming with Writer/Director Adam McKay to score Will Ferrell another hit. Sure, Wedding Crashers did so much better than anyone would have ever expected, but all he had was a cameo very late in the film. His most successful film before that was Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Bergundy. The comedy and chemistry was excellent in that film, and even with the really lame material, made the film work in so many ways. Now we have Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. While not necessarily being a better film than Anchorman, it still ranks as a very positive improvement from the rest of the films Ferrell has been doing as of late.",2006
3,"Ricky Bobby is born in the backseat of a car. His father is driving so fast, he over-shoots the hospital and has to slam on the brakes. Alas, Ricky Bobby plops out right there on the back seat. Not actually seen, of course, but we get the picture with the sound effects they had. ""I wanna go fast"" are the only words out of his mouth through much of his childhood. I wanted something to go fast too. After the first ten minutes of this movie, I wanted it to go fast right along so I could get the hell out of the theater. There is some funny stuff in this movie but I only really laughed a couple times, the rest were just chuckles if that. One of these laughs came from the delightful Molly Shannon (bless her heart). For those of you who are planning on watching this movie, I say go rent (or even buy) ANCHORMAN instead. After this movie, I can honestly say that Ron Burgundy is better than Ricky Bobby. TALLADEGA NIGHTS offers nothing but but high speed ho-hums and is very tedious. Nuff' said.",2006
6,Trying to review and rate a movie like this is tougher than most might think. There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY. Then there are those that'll snub it as another foolish not-ready-for-prime-time-style spoof designed to engage our dumbed-down society. But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.,2006

For most important politicians are responsible for this ""operative act"".",2006
10,"I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10.",2006

10,"Germany has produced some very good movies recently ... but this one is in a class of its own. The main power of a quality movie, for me, has always been two things, a good story and mood - and this film has both. The story keeps you interested through all 139 minutes. You actually feel yourself transported to the 1980s of the former German republic. They have carefully chosen locations that looks east-germanish ... lots of ""Trabant"" cars on the streets :-) and the general grayish mood is very well recreated. The ordinary peoples fear of the Stasi is realistically portrayed. And i just love the twist in the story in the last 20 minutes or so. A brilliant movie that anyone even remotely interested in non-mainstream movies should see.",2006
10,"This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist f√ºr mich"".

I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many ""IM's"" (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.",2007

10,"When I first heard about Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's film ""Das Leben der Anderen"" and the issue it dealt with, I instantly tipped it to be one of the must-see films. As a great cinema-goer and a genuine admirer of the European cinematography, I was overwhelmed with a notion that a succession of thought-provoking German films would be continued with this moving insight into the lives of others at a very delicate period of the 80s in East Germany. After months of waiting, the Serbian audience was presented with ""Das Leben der Anderen"" during The Belgrade Film Festival and we related to it to the extent that whilst leaving the cinema many of us commented on how pleased we would be to see it win the Oscar. And it did, the very same night.",2007
9,"This film, set in the theater world of the mid-1980s, was particularly satisfying to me because I was a producer of avant-garde theater through the 1980s, based in San Francisco but often on tour -- including to international theater festivals in West Germany, communist Poland and communist Yugoslavia in 1987. Although my experience as an American was of course very different than the experience of these East Berliners, there is a mood and sense of personalities in this film that I found authentic and familiar. The people in this film feel like the people I met in the festival bars and refreshment centers for participating artists and on panel discussions in those festivals. ",2007
9,"I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.",2007
10,Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich M√ºhe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.,2007

10,"This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the ""Shield and the Sword"" of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M√ºhe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film ""Sonata for a Good Man"" is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it.",2007

As one who live in such a country, I think this movie is a masterpiece and Ulrich Muhe made a brilliant role, and maybe he's the man who should win the Oscar this year. In a world full of suspicion and secret services entering every people's life, the STASI officer risks his job for a noble cause, which the communists hated at that time - THE CULTURE. A really amazing production and a page of history ""written"" with genius by the crew of this film. Congratulations !",2007

9,"I saw this as a sneak preview with my fraternity. I was hesitant to see it because of how bad Mission Impossible 2 was, but I think it more than makes up for the 2nd flop and I would even argue that it's better than the first. The action really is non-stop, and there aren't any cheesy love scenes slowing anything down. The bad guy doesn't change every five minutes either. The plot moves quickly but it doesn't lose the audience at all. You don't need to have seen either of the first two to understand what is going on (I can't remember the plot from either). Lots of guns, loud explosions, cool gadgets and fun locations. I can remember on more than one occasion where the audience clapped or reacted to the action. It does everything an action movie should do very well. I would highly advise anyone who likes action movies to go see it. Even if you think Tom Cruise is a little insane, MI:III is extremely enjoyable.",2006
7,"Not bad at all. After the John Woo craptastic crapfest that was MI2, Lost creator JJ Abrams takes over and makes a flick that is at least as good as the first one, possibly better in some respects. Some real surprises early in the flick start things off fast, and it keeps up the pace pretty well from there on. Sure, it's mostly same-old same-old, but it was fun and action-packed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was fine as a villain, but was really not even in the movie that much. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise as usual, but for two hours I was able to forget about all his offscreen stupidity. You know what this really felt like? 24: The Movie. ...which they are apparently going to make. It should end up being much like MI3, and I think that'd be just fine.",2007

Action consisting of explosions, clever bombs, helicopter chases, flashbacks to True Lies without spoiling too much, evil villains, heartbreaking stunts and a pretty okay script is what you can expect.",2006
9,"When you walk into a movie expecting to be blown away by death defying  stunts and tremendous special effects, it's easy to be disappointed.  What a monumental task directors had in making MI3 even more  over-the-top and more spectacular than the first two. Mission  Accomplished. (Sorry.)  Tom Cruise takes Ethan Hunt to new heights. Fishbourne is great as the  ambiguously dirty IMF leader. But the best actor in the movie is Philip  Seymour Hoffman. Not many actors can take a role that's more  one-dimensional than Doctor Evil and turn it into a deeply layered  performance. From an acting standpoint, there was almost a feeling that  he was too good for this movie and the actors around him. He doesn't  breathe the same air as this cast, not even Tom Cruise.  The women in the movie are a dichotomy. On the one hand you have Bahar  Soomekh, an unknown actress who kicks ass and takes names on par with  the bad boys, Cruise, and Ving Rhames. On the other you have Keri  Russell in a part we've seen too many times in this kind of movie. The  wide-eyed innocent who becomes the villain's prize and the hero's  salvation. Keri Russell and Michelle Monaghan spend most of this movie  tied to a chair. I hope they're not method actresses. They would have  to spend the last year of filming at home, bound and gagged in the  kitchen. At least they made Monaghan a doctor, so we know she's smart,  even if she's so na√Øve she thinks her husband works for the department  of transportation.   Forget the love story, forget the corruption at IMF, forget the plot  entirely. None of it matters. All that matters is ""how are we going to  get in"" and ""how are we going to get out"" and the magnificent twists  and turns that follow. Some action movies spend way too much time  milking the set up of a weak script before the explosions and the  stunts finally kick in. Others dull your senses with one mindless  montage of violence and car chases, without a point to be found. MI3  walks the line perfectly¬Öthe story is simple enough to understand but  well-thought out enough to not poke gaping holes in it. Now let's get  to the action.   MI3 manages the action sequences smartly, expertly getting your heart  rate (and hopes) up and then bring you crashing back down to earth. The  thrill of victory, the agony of defeat, followed by a 10 minutes of  blah blah blah.   ""You shouldn't get married,"" Ving says to Tom in the middle of a  dangerous operation. ""You know guys who do what we do can't be  married."" By the way, this is another well-worn action film technique.  Inject casual talk between principals during the most intense and  dangerous scenes. It shows that they're so highly-skilled and  confident, they can chat nonchalantly about relationships while in the  middle of an elaborate Vatican City break-in. Thank you Quentin. Thank  you Bruce Willis. But the breaks in the action work. They give you a  chance to buy into the suspense each time, from your feet up.  Acknowledging that you're drained from the previous sequence, they give  you time to catch your breath and then come at you all over again.  The air-to-ground assault on the Washington Bridge is astounding.  Cruise attempting to catapult between two skyscrapers in Shanghais is  beyond belief. Watching him descend way too fast from said skyscraper  in a flimsy parachute, knowing he's going to crash down onto the busy  freeway and immediately be run over by a gas tanker? Priceless.   Remarkable stunts, solid acting, and a villain that may be the best  ever in this genre (Hoffman) makes MI3 the best of the series and maybe  the best action movie ever made. Until 4, that is.",2006
3,"Well, I do apologize for the humongous amount of spoilers, but I'm hoping nobody will see this movie after I'm done with it.

5,"The TV show, which I loved, was about outsmarting people. The IMF was a government sponsored confidence team whose job it was to manipulate events in such a way as to thwart and get rid of the bad guys without anybody even knowing they existed. They use some gadgets but mostly impersonate people to set things up so that they didn't even need to be there for things to play out the way they wanted. They hardly ever used violence and their plots never came down to a car chase, a firefight or a boxing match between the head of the team and the bad guy. That would have been way too sloppy. They would be clinking champagne glasses, knowing ""Our work here is done"" while Lalo Schrifin's classic theme, which had followed them throughout, accenting their every move, began to play in an upbeat mode in celebration of their achievement. They made their impossible missions seem very possible while the audience wondered what it must be like to be that clever.",2006

Let's ignore the fact that audiences seem to be getting tired of movies that are nothing more than extravaganzas of special effects.,2006
8,"I agree with most of the posted comments, it's easily the best of the three and I think the secret recipe this time is J.J. Abrams. Producer Cruise has surrounded himself with talented actors before (Henry Czerny, Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave in M:I and Anthony Hopkins and Dougray Scott in M:I 2) and it didn't work so well. He chose a vacuous hole as an actress for M:I 2 (Newton) so we don't buy the romance. He chose two talented directors (DePalma and Woo who have done far better work elsewhere) and it didn't help. Robert Towne did work in both scripts and his contribution didn't turn the movie into a cohesive whole. Both movies were a mess, with some great parts and a lot of bad parts.",2006

5,"Messy, loud, ridiculous and all the other things that the devoted fans of the genre expect. At least that's what I imagine. Personally, I find it an indigested souffl√© full of heavy duty ingredients that don't seem to melt all that way together. Fortysomething super star Tom Crusie - one of my favorites from the 80's and 90's - runs like the wind from Shanghai to the Vatican (the one in Caserta not the one in Rome)I didn't know what the rabbit foot was and, quite simply, I didn't care. In fact I didn't care about any of it. It took a me little while to realize that the wife in jeopardy wasn't Katie Holmes and I was kind of embarrassed for Philip Seymour Hoffman and Billy Crudup. To think that with all the power at Cruise/Wagner's feet, they could be making the most extraordinary movies. Commercial movies too, but how disappointing to find out that their ambitions are so basic and pedestrian. MI3 as an action flick I guess it's okay but, just okay, shouldn't be acceptable and for what I gather, it wasn't. Come on Tom, you can afford to take risks, can't you? So what are you waiting for? I know you could still dazzled us. ""Born On The 4th Of July"" ""Color Of Money"" and ""Rain Man"" were not that long ago.",2007
10,"Casino Royale (2006) is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film, the real Bond film unlike lackluster sh**y Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death, from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action, action, action and even more action. Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.",2017
8,"I saw this at a cast and crew screening in London last weekend: I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The tone is much edgier and nastier than the Brosnan movies, harking back more to Dr. No or For Your Eyes Only. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Martin Campbell, who also made 'Goldeneye', was an excellent choice and, for me, is one of the best Bond directors. What gives this the lead over recent Bonds is the more realistic feel: the exotic locales, fast cars, spectacular action, beautiful women and many other Bond hallmarks are all here but gone is the campy tone that marred, say, Die Another Day. Yes, the whole franchise is based on an entirely ridiculous and cartoonish notion but the more serious and harder-edged tone works really well here. In this context, Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. I'll be the first to admit that I raised an eyebrow when I heard he was cast but he really makes it his own. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds: Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here, as suits the overall tone of the film, Bond is much more of a sadist, a cold-hearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig, with his piercing eyes, suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoon-like and flippant, too, with every punch, kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also, the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film; the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Whilst the film has enough of it's fair share of action, the emphasis is equally on character and storyline and less on gadgets and sheer implausibility. When there isn't a huge action sequence happening, you don't miss it: the film's longest set-piece, the poker game at the Casino Royale, is as (or not more) gripping and entertaining than any of the chases and shoot-outs. The only minor gripes that I have are a slightly too long running time: the film drags a wee bit towards the end and, although it helps the tone of the film, we don't hear enough of the Bond theme tune! However, great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography, Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other top-notch craft and technical departments make 'Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies.",2006
10,"Now look, I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. Some might say a purist.I make no apologies for believing that Timothy Dalton is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond.",2006
8,"Anyone who has followed the James Bond series over the last four decades knows that the new Bond has changed... In ""Casino Royale,"" 007 do not identify himself with the classic words, ""Bond. James Bond,"" and instead of playing Chemin-de-Fer or Craps, he plays Poker and he doesn't care whether his vodka martinis are shaken or stirred nor he drinks a Smirnoff vodka, or a five-star Hennessey, or a Dom P√©rignon'52... He never pauses to take a finger of Caviar¬Ö He never enjoys a good cigar and is less preoccupied with matters of sex¬Ö ",2009
8,"First off, the negative. Casino Royale is both too long and too short. Like OHMSS, there are moments when the running time feels its length and others where you think something's missing because they suddenly tried to trim the running time by not shooting bits. At times you'd be grateful for a little bit of exposition BEFORE a couple of the big action scenes rather than after. And some of the script has some lines as subtle as a car crash that stink of Paul Haggis' brand of heavy handedness. The big finale is just a bit too much, as if they're afraid not to destroy some big building again because that's what they always do.",2006
10,"James Bond is back and he is alive and well. Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What ""Batman Begins"" did for that franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond. A masterpiece of popular film-making and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.",2006
9,This is among the best bond movies! You have to see it. ,2006
8,"What a difference a great actor makes. Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character, we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as, the sensational Eva Green, points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond. The script is more compact and organic. The locations are breathtaking and what else I can say? The series have been reinvigorated, rejuvenated and in one single stroke have secured that this franchise will live forever. A note to Barbara Broccoli, the producer, your father would be so proud. Congratulations!",2007
10,"In the original Bond series, only a handful of films really attempted to touch base with the novels of Ian Fleming. ""Dr. No"" showed the Fleming feeling for character and action, but introduced elements to the plot that detracted from the 'hard-boiled' spy story that Fleming thought he was writing; ""Thunderball"" came close, but that was because Fleming developed the story on commission for the film. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" had the book's plot pretty down pat, and was made in a kind of 'grand adventure' style, but of course it suffered from the choice of Lazenby - a professional model, not an actor - as Bond. ""The Living Daylights"" showed the producers' interest in returning to the roots, but Dalton was uncomfortable playing Bond, and uncomfortable with the wisecracks which had become part of the character's schtick - and which were really badly written for the Dalton films. ""Goldeneye"" was admirable attempt to update the Fleming milieu for the end of the Cold War, but left the character himself as yet without an 'updated' definition.",2006

10,"I saw this at a special premiere and i was amazed. having never been a Bond fan i wasn't really expecting much from this. After watching Brosnans invisible car in the previous incarnation I thought it could only get worse. How wrong was I! this film is gritty and sharp. the dialogue is sharp and well thought out with Daniel Craig being the DEFINITIVE Bond. He exudes confidant menace. They have gone back to basics with this Bond ie character and dialogue driven and not thankfully gadget driven. Not only is it the best bond film out so far its one of the years best films out. They have borrowed some elements from the Bourne series of films which is long overdue on the franchise, more realistic fight sequences and with Daniel Craig actually looking like a physically capable man instead of the middle aged paunch of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan who both quite frankly couldn't beat up a Ritz cracker.",2006

7,"Though it doesn't care too much about the series' continuity (it's supposed to be Bond's first mission as a 00 agent, but it takes place after the Cold war and Judi Dench is already M), ""Casino Royale"" is a great re-creation of the series. Cool action, great thrills and a more humane Bond more than make up for the purported lack of gadgets. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a rough secret who only gradually acquires the class and cold demeanor we all know and love. He makes mistakes in the course of his mission, but that makes him even more of a hero. Although I found it hard at first to cope with Craig's looks, he is more than suitable as the character. Bond is portrayed as a man with flaws and weaknesses, which makes him look even stronger. The story is not your usual Bond plot and relies more on classical thrills than technology, though the action is extremely hard-boiled. Kudos to the creepy Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd for creating remarkably believable characters. A definite must-see for Bond fans : it should reconcile at last Ian Fleming aficionados and fans of the film series !",2006
8,"Casino Royale is a major step-up from the flamboyant Die Another Day. Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a young-ish Daniel Craig, there is no Q, no campy gadgets, no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits, no world-dominating super-colossus villains, no Miss Funnyfanny (or whatever), and no silly one-liners after killing bad guys. Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone. I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I'm glad someone had the balls to go back to the hard-edged nature of the series, last seen in Licence to Kill.",2006
1,"As an avid Bond watcher, and having watched each one several times, and having watched this one at a movie house just yesterday with three other interested persons, I'm considering moving on to another interest. This movie did not interest me in the least! It is not to be considered as high brow literary work but as interesting action movies. This one is interesting for the first few minutes and then looses my interest from then on. The storyline is difficult to understand and there are no outrages gadgets or other Bond like characteristics that I have been used to. Where were the incredibly beautiful women and sequences of action in ever changing locals? I was not only confused by the storyline but also bored by the characters. I was having trouble determining who were the good and bad guys. For a time I thought that Bond was the bad guy and couldn't figure out who was supposed to be Bond then. For the entire movie, where were the beautiful women? Some of the best ones were not the final one that Bond was after in actuality. As a final note of confusion, what about that supposed largest plane in the world! What was the point of that sequence? It could have been left out of the movie entirely and it wouldn't have made any difference at all. Final comment, this one was worse than any movie that I've considered the worst, so there to the writers, producers and directors of this mess!",2006
1,"Let me try an analogy: you go to MacDonald and they have no burgers, they serve no fries, no Coke, they have no mustard or ketchup. In fact they only serve Vegan food, they are dressed in black and green uniforms and the sign in front of the building is a monkey!!! But they are very proud of their MacDonald store!!! Have the producers lost the plot? Do they and the many commentators on this site understand the notion of a ""brand"" or the ""recipe"" of a Bond movie? So many commentators here are making ""intellectual"" commentaries praising this movie and I would agree with quite a few of them IF this would be a generic action movie, but this is supposed to be a Bond movie. How can so many people miss this point? How about a remake of Romeo and Juliet without Romeo and Juliet, without any love story and I'll name the movie Seinfeld? Maybe it would be a good movie, but not a Romeo and Juliet!!!! How about the totally politically correct, perfectly in tune with the UK policy these days, tone of the movie? They started a few movies ago when they appointed a woman for the role of M and now James Bond doesn't flirt with women any more, he is not witty any more, he refuses random sex, he falls in love with the most banal woman in town, he cries like a girl, he crashes his Aston Martin like a beginner in about 30 seconds without being chased by anyone and he runs out of money???? James Bond broke? And people still insist that this movie is a Bond movie? What is this, mass brain washing? James Bond is a chauvinistic, flirtatious, macho, heterosexual man, a modern Don Juan combined with a modern D'Artagnan, with a great love for beautiful women (not blah women), for the best cars, for the best gadgets, that travels the world in the most exotic destinations without concern for money, he's always dressed top notch, he likes the best things in life, best cigars, best drinks, he's extremely quick and witty and flirtatious in his conversations etc. That is the James Bond that I and many like myself would love to see again and unfortunately, Daniel Craig is not him. Although a nice guy and an accomplished actor, he is not James Bond, he's just too rough. Hugh Laurie would be a better Bond, Hugh Grant would be a better Bond and Clive Owen would probably be the best Bond of all times if only Barbara Brocolli would stop messing around and make great BOND movies again.",2009

The plot barely makes sense, Daniel Craig pouts far more than any human (let alone man) should, there's no good action scenes, the best sequence of the movie looks like an extended Volvo ad and the film has a 45 minute poker sequence in the middle that's no better than Celebrity Poker off the TV, except of course when i watch it on TV i don't know who's going to win. This film was a huge let down. It was hard to imagine that I would look back on the Pierce Brosnan days with fond memories but somehow the makers of this latest debacle have achieved it. But worst of all, worse than the wooden dialogue and bizarre attempt at love story, worse than all that was that there was not a single bad guy worth his salt in the whole movie. If the world doesn't have super villains it surely doesn't need super spies either.",2007

8,"After just seeing ""Invincible"" I must say thumbs up! Way to go that finally after 30 years this true story is brought to the big screen. Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan, but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and part-time school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him, to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him, but thru his will and determination to make it, because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a blue-collar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie, especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable, but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons, well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil, overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more real-life NFL movies are made about players, because ""Invincible"" sets the standard.",2006
8,"Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.",2006
8,"I just came from and advanced screening tonight and it was an entertaining feel-good movie. The movie is based on a true ""local guy makes good"" story, and quite entertaining (although after searching online for Papale, it appears that they may have taken a bit of dramatic license with some of the details). The story telling and acting were good. I think Kinnear's presentation of Dick Vermeil (I remember seeing Vermeil on the local T.V. a lot back then) was outstanding. Mark Wahlberg gave a credible performance as a determined underdog here, he seems to be maturing as an actor, and from what I could tell was in good physical condition to play this role. Kirk Acevado and Mark Raspoli put in good supporting performances as (sometime) supportive friends and relatives. The movie is an O.K. family movie if you don't mind a bit of swearing and sports/football violence (tackles, blocks and those sorts of things).",2006
7,"First off - I'm biased. Let me get that out of the way first. I grew up in Center City Philly during the 70's and am a life-long Eagles fan. So, I was pretty excited to see the movie to get juiced for the upcoming 2006 Eagles season while also hoping to relive Philly life from 1976.",2006
7,"Never underestimate the power of a good story, decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's ""Invincible,"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear, brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries, including ""Remember The Titans,"" and last's year's golf film, ""The Greatest game Ever Played,"" so they know their stuff.",2006
8,"Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person, i am a fan of his films and his work, and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home, since i remember Vince Papale, how bad the Eagles were, Dick Vermeil and of course, the infamous Tom Landry, so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too, and, thankfully, i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film, and for the most part, it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting, which for me was the essence of this film, and that was, camaraderie, support, atmosphere, and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too, the seeming A**h** who turned out to be a courageous, self-sacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead (remake).I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects, with the exception of The Fast and the Furious, and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated, such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number, 83, taped on his back; and he saw his friends playing football in the mud, a long-held tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment, strikes, and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes, this film was very formulaic. But the film was ""inspired"" by a real person; a son of Philadelphia; the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end, for a less abrupt denouement; but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage, determination, the American dream, family and friends. Those aspects came through very well, even in spite of Papale's life-long struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans.",2006
10,"Not just for Philadelphia Eagles fans, but for all sports fans who love a great underdog story. Watching this film, I was transported back to the gritty streets of South Philly in 1976, watching the impossible dream unfold for a guy down on his luck, but determined to change his life with his love for football -- and for his favorite team, the Eagles. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job playing the improbable hero Vince Papale. The supporting cast is also very good, with a great turn by Elizabeth Banks, who believes in Vince's dream of making it in the NFL. It shows that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. A film for the whole family to enjoy!",2006
10,"I gave this film a 10 rating which is highly unusual for me. But, upon reflection, I could find NOTHING wrong with it. The actors are perfectly cast. The musical score is great at transporting you back to the day. The scripting is wonderfully low-key and seemingly true to life. There is no overwhelming sentimentality, yet there is also no unnecessary violence or foul language. In short, it's perfect.",2006
6,"Somewhat loosely based on a true story, INVINCIBLE is your standard root-for-the-underdog sports movie, nothing more, nothing less. Mark Wahlberg is Vince Papale, a beefy touch football player/bartender who struts his stuff at an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. Overcoming tremendous odds, Papale cracks the roster after earning the faith of rookie coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear).",2007
8,"I have a friend here in Baton Rouge, La. who was very anxious to see this movie, so for his 38th birthday (which was actually on August 22) I decided to take him to this and pay all admission and concession. From the beginning with Jim Croce's ""I Got a Name"" to the exciting end with Vince Papale's triumphant touchdown in his first regular home game, this was one inspirational movie! Mark Wahlberg does a fine job portraying the sad-sack Philadelphian. Greg Kinnear is equally good as a former college football coach taking a chance on an only ""open tryout"" player who only did high school games. The best scenes are the ones taking place during the first regular season game at the Dallas Cowboy stadium and then the first regular home game opposite the New York Giants (which Vince's girlfriend Janet supports!). By the way, my birthday friend really enjoyed this movie so on his and my recommendation, by all means seek this one out!",2006
10,"I was very pleasantly surprised as to how good this movie was. I haven't seen a movie this good all year. It is a great story not only about Vince Papale but also Dick Vermeil's first season as coach in Philly. Growing up in South Jersey and seeing many Eagles games as a kid, Disney did an excellent job making you feel like you were in Veteran's Stadium in the mid-70's. The stadium announcer even sounded identical to the one at the old Vet. This is a story line every bit as good as Rudy and in my opinion, better. The shots of the city of Philadelphia are good. You will not be disappointed by this one! I went into the movie thinking that I wouldn't hate it but I wouldn't love it either, but I was wrong, it was much better than I would have thought. And it is extra special for an Eagles fan, but great for all football fans.",2006

South Philly has had many famous people come from it; my town has one: Vince Papale. Was it so hard to give us that? They gloss over his pre-Eagles life, but I guess it couldn't be an inspirational feel-good movie if they had stuck to the truth, i.e. he came from the suburbs, he had a career as a professional football player before he played for the Eagles, etc.",2007
4,"From the time I saw the first preview for ""Invincible,"" I was very excited to see it. I loved ""Remember the Titans,"" and this seemed to be that kind of movie: a sports film with a good cast that alters the mold and tries something new and interesting. Perhaps this is the reason that ""Invincible"" proved to be such a disappointment for me.",2007
8,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! I met Dick Vermeil in '75 when he was recruiting my h.s. boyfriend to play for UCLA just prior to his leaving for Philly - nice guy (but the boyfriend went w/ Mike White at Cal - GO BEARS!). Dick is a class act; that he gave the time of day to me, a high school wide receiver's girlfriend says something about the man.",2007
5,"INVINCIBLE, though the title of this very Walt Disney/Hallmark Card docudrama, is a term that could be applied to the plethora of movies built on the stories of down and outers who pull themselves up by the boot strings due to their success in sports. Brad Gann is responsible for the script of the life of Vince Papale, a 30ish out of work substitute teacher, deserted husband, depressed South Philly member of a gang of friends who pass the time while jobless playing football in the muddy vacant lots of their part of the world.",2006
3,"I was really looking forward to an inspirational sports movie. I like macho male bonding and on the field violence. I was very disappointed. The plot is a joke and the acting is worse. I know its based on a true story but it was just so predictable. What was up with the love story? Invincible is a cookie cutter film and best saved for a very slow Sunday afternoon at home during football's off season. My girlfriend fell asleep and I was barely hanging on to the end. I don't know how you can make a movie about an underdog, football, and beer boring but they did it. The scenes where the ""boys"" are playing football in some old empty lot is a joke. Is this supposed to resonate with the common man? Like we all play football in empty lots in the pouring rain kicking the crap out of each other like we are 15? Come on. Please.",2007
5,"This story is very uplifting. It's about a 30 year old bartender/layed off teacher, whose wife just left him. He tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and against all odds, makes the team. Coach Vermeil sticks with Vince because he's got heart, even though his assistant coaches think he should be cut. Vince goes on to play several years in the NFL.",2007
9,"I saw this movie at a sneak peak. I screen all PG-13 movies before my children are able to see them. This one is rated PG-13 for the football ""violence."" The football scenes were so intense, I cringed at how painful they looked. I loved the fact where they just show the hum-drum of everyday life without trying to make everything appear beautiful. They background of South Philly portrayed was wonderful. Mark Walburg did a marvelous job as Vince Papale. To Kevin Conway who portrayed Frank Papale, WOW!!!! You sure can make a girl cry. The remaining cast were perfect in all their roles. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This movie would be great for boys and girls who love football and those who don't. It is just a great story.",2006
8,"This film is very excellent from the plot up. This movie is based on the true story of this normal guy, whom had a dream and chased after his dream to attain his goals. This is the same actor that was in 4 brothers he is a pretty talented actor. The Football aspect of this movie will really appeal to sports fans alike. The team-work aspects that are displayed in the football scenes are awesome. The Soundtrack sounds pretty leveled out and catchy. I think they use a Nickelback song in it. Side of a bullet if I am not mistaken. This will for sure storyline wise beat out Snakes on a plane, and is good to even show the family. The Film is owned by Disney so you can't go wrong with that. So I recommend this film to any sports fanatic, football fan or a family man.",2006
7,Mark Wahlberg gives a splendid performance as a former teacher and bartender who gets the chance of a life to play professional football with the Philadelphia Eagles.,2007
5,"I would only recommend this film if either you were a sports nut or a fan of Vince Papale. I, personally, did not see anything special or original about this film. The screenplay and dialogue were extremely tired and clich√©, while the film itself drags along at a slow pace. This film doesn't even try to present the story of Vince Papale in an interesting or enlightening way. Instead, ""Invincible"" only uses the same old formula that every sports movie before it developed. I guess the writers just felt tired of trying and went through the stacks, taking ideas from ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Rudy"". I almost felt psychic. I've seen this same old crap a thousand times before and I don't need to see it a thousand times more. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against Vince Papale or the story of his life, but I think justice hasn't been done for Vince. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance, one word: disappointed. He's a great actor but he was just not at his best. Let me just say that this was one of the few movies I've ever seen in my lifetime that I actually felt like sleeping through. And that's saying a lot. People are going to remember Vince Papale, but they're not going to remember this movie.",2006
3,*********SPOILER WARNING********** ,2006
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Disney throws us another inspirational true story ... this time about South Philly's Vince Papale, a local bartender who was a walk-on cult hero for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1970's. Think ""Rudy"" in South Philly or ""Rocky"" in football pads.",2006
9,"It's a great, funny show. Fey is very good in the lead role; she blew away my expectations. Kudos to her for creating such a fun, funny, witty and quality TV show. Baldwin is at his dry-witted, brilliant best (someone at work said to me, ""yeah I heard Alec Baldwin is in it, but isn't that show a comedy?"" ...did not know the man did comedy. Did not know). Morgan (who I don't normally like; not on SNL or elsewhere) is hysterical and plays the role perfectly. The minor characters are all very good and amusing, and I can't wait to see them develop more and more. The writing/material is quality crazy with sit-com wackiness, sketch comedy variety/character and fast-paced intelligent wit. If you like to laugh (something a comedy should make you do), please check this show out; if you think a lot of the other crap on TV is amusing, you'll really love this one. Hurry, before it gets canceled.",2006
10,"I wasn't sure to expect from 30 Rock, having watched the steady decline of SNL over the last seven years or so. I felt, however, that this was not really a result of the writing as much as it was of the underutilization and/or departure of the most talented players (Ferrell, Oteri, and now Maya Rudolph, for example) and the periodic overexposure of less talented players (I'm looking at you, Jimmy Fallon). I was also encouraged by the fact that the many of the bright spots in SNL's history during that period were provided by host Alec Baldwin. So I was not 100% surprised to find that I love 30 Rock. Baldwin is, as usual, brilliant, and Tina Fey is a fantastic writer who also is humble enough to recognize her strengths and limitations as an actor. Tracy Morgan is constantly off his chain and, along with Baldwin and Jack McBrayer, provides most of the ""God, I had to rewind because it was so damned ridiculous"" moments (""Imagine Christmas wishes shooting out of your eyes."") The supporting cast is also talented and well utilized; I was very glad to see that ""Toofer"" and ""Cerie,"" among others, were upgraded to regulars for Season Two. From political satire to slapstick, it's all here. And as an African-American, I was impressed by the way racial issues were handled, from the use of the ""N word"" to the ""white guilt"" issues to the country club episode; they were skillfully handled, as some of these are hot button topics and could have gone very, very wrong. This show is just plain good.",2007
10,This show has the best writing on TV to date. I know Fey was the original creator of this show. She has reinvented comedy and especially women's place in it. Kudos Tina! You deserve all your success! I've been looking in vein on line to get the full list of staff writers for 30 rock but have yet to find the full list. They all deserve praise. The wit and repartee apparent in the writing is supreme... and the direction isn't too shabby either.,2009
10,"There's an ever-so-faint ""Woody Allen"" tinge to this inspired behind the scenes look at a live network TV comedy show. But Tina Fey and the other writers can ALWAYS be counted on to take everything just a step or two farther. The performances are uniformly brilliant. Jane Krakowski is delicious as the slightly pass√© actress who blissfully pounces on the feeblest opportunity to perform. Tracy Morgan is unrestrainedly larger than life in a role that only he could play. Alec Baldwin has such a rich insight into his convoluted, unpredictable character and plays him with such abandon -- it just makes you gasp! And the rest of the cast plays with a level of virtuosity that has only been seen a few times in the history of network television. The comedy is so dense and so polished that it's hard to believe you are watching a weekly program. I come by way of Monty Python, SNL, SCTV, Kids In The Hall, Frasier, Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Jackie Thomas, Newsradio, Just Shoot Me, and Everybody Loves Raymond. I can hardly believe I'm saying this, but, even after all these GREAT comedies, I think this is the smartest and the funniest TV show I've ever seen!",2007
8,It's always been my contention that great comedians make some of the best dramatic actors.,2006
10,-Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey are brilliant -the writing is so funny and appealing to both a male and female sense of humor -I love Liz Lemon. This is a female character I don't think I've really seen before or not for a very long time. She is smart and nerdy and neurotic and successful...and she can hang with the guys and is kind of a dweeb...so relatable for nerdy girls like me! This and Ugly Betty (for different reasons) are the best new shows and they will run for a long long time.,2007
10,"If you've watched SNL this year (2006 -2007) you realize just how much they miss Tina Fey's writing. I think last night was episode 8 and like all previous shows it was ""laugh out loud"" funny. ""Red wine is just not your drink"", Jane Krakowski's character tells Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey has surrounded herself with some terrific unknowns including a guy who looks a lot like Jimmie Fallon who did some unfreeking believable impressions last night. Alec Baldwin WILL win the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor. Even Tracy Morgan, never my favorite on SNL, is terrific as the Martin Lawrence-esquire insane 'star'. Tina Fey has always been the reluctant sex symbol but she 'takes one for the team' and has done several episodes dressed to the nines causing jaws to drop across America. Now that the show is part of the best NBC Thursday lineup assembled since the Seinfeld-Frasier days, look for a long, healthy life for ""30 Rock"".",2007
10,"Alec Baldwin is great in this role. This is a very witty and funny show. It's not your usual numbing with canned laughter waste of 30 minutes. The characters are quirky and believable - they remind me of some people I work with. The only character that doesn't gel with me is Tracy Jordan. Somehow, it's not a good fit for him. Whereas Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin along with the rest of the cast are essential to the success of the show, Tracy Jordan could easily be left out and the show would still work.",2006
8,"After the last few lackluster seasons of Saturday Night Live, I was worried that this show would suffer from the same affliction as those terrible SNL-based films, like The Ladies Man, Superstar, Coneheads, Night at the Roxbury.... but 30 Rock is actually a character-driven comedy, rather than a gag-driven one like those films.",2006

2,"Television Comedy is in a sad sad state if this is considered one of the best comedies on TV. The jokes are cheep, and formulaic. Instead of playing to the lowest common denominator they are in fact lowering the bar. The characters are impossible to connect with being little more than cheep stereotypes. It's like a badly written SNL take off of Studio 60 that just wont die. I'd give it a 1 but I like the production design. I can only imagining they bought their Emmy nominations. Visually it's irritating. They can't seem to decide if they're filming The Office or Law and Order. What happened to the days of the live studio audience? Are they afraid the audience just wont laugh. Many of the jokes are so bad and offensive any self respecting audience would walk out. Or possibly go old school and start throwing thing. Don't support this show. Demand something better! Demand comedy with thought put into it that doesn't insult our intelligence.",2007
4,"My family and I were looking forward to a show that was all it was hyped up to be when we all gathered in the living room for a family TV night. And what do we get? A simple, ongoing, bad SNL skit. The lines are dry, the acting is dry, the outcomes of nearly everything were predictable to the point where we were not looking forward to anything. Even Alec Baldwin (and this is coming from a huge Baldwin fan), who has won several awards for this performance (can't imagine why), is simple, unexciting, uninteresting... I could go on. The geeky tour guide is supposed to provide some extra comic relief, and, again, fails miserably. Don't even get me started on Tracy Morgan himself - simply put, he is WAAAAAY over-the-top.",2009
3,"I rented the first DVD after reading the positive reviews -- what a disappointment! The themes and the jokes were just one step up from the Saturday Night Live jokes for adolescents having grown up in a prudish nation. I was supposed to laugh about: men dressing as women, someone taken for a lesbian who isn't, immature mid-20s men who eat with their mouths open, small penises, ""embarrassing"" mishaps, crass sexual advances aiming at the wrong object, and such.",2007
2,I have had enough of this stupid show. At first I felt it was a light hearted comedy with a few laughs but after a time Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan start to really get on my nerves. They don't know when to shut-up and a little bit of them goes a very long way. Plus the fact Tina Fey thinks the viewing audience will find it funny when a young African American boy calls Alec Baldwin a cracker. HA HA and HE HE I forgot to laugh. In fact there are several examples in this show when racial remarks are used towards white people that Tina Fey and her writers think are funny. They are not! In fact it is offensive. Think about the shoe on the other foot and you will get my point....,2009
10,"As an American who grew up in Europe, I always coveted ""Saturday Night Live"". It was one of those items of American culture I had grown up hearing about but could not see unless I visited relatives in the States. And when I moved here in the late '80's I started following it religiously. And sometimes it was good, and sometimes it was hilarious, but often it was hit or miss. And in the mid to late '90's it got Godawful.",2007
10,"Flicking through the mundane channels that plague my TV, I saw an advert for a new American hit show called 30 Rock. I have to say I was skeptical as the certain television station is known for their poor programming. But I threw caution to the wind and decided to watch it (being bored on a Saturday night will do that to you). I watched two episodes that were, I think mid season two and thought it was hilarious and also satisfied my need of smart humor to a great extent. You see I am on an Arrested Development come down, having watched all three seasons religiously after many recommendations, and have so far found that nothing really comes close to it. So finding this show was a blessing in disguise and my life is now complete, well until I watch all the seasons.",2009
10,"This show becomes addictive. Like the Office, the other current flagship comedy show on NBC (and, very thankfully, playing back to back on Thursday nights), it has a curious effect on a first-time viewer: you may not entirely laugh out loud (although it may depend on what episode), but it gets the curiosity going enough to want to watch more. By two or three episodes, it's a hooker, so to speak - 30 Rock is a show that even if you just start watching it at the start of the third season you'll want to see everything else that has been going on before in the previous two (and, unlike the Office, Tina Fey's creation isn't very plot-continuity heavy save for a couple of details and Will Arnett or Rip Torns' characters). A big part of this are the stars; it's a good thing Tina Fey stars on top of writing/producing duties, because she is an underrated female comic talent- even as a straight character to comic relief like Kenneth or Tracy Jordan/Morgan she's incredibly sharp and with some nuance. And, of course, Alec Baldwin as her boss Jack: he is probably the biggest draw, and is so consistently hilarious you may need to stop and rewind if you got a DVD or Tivo to check out again some of the things he does with the character- it should be so obvious after a while, but it works, totally, without a beat lost. Add on to this supporting work from (breakout) character actor McBrayer as nerdy and soft-spoken Kenneth, Jane Krakowski's joyously egotistical starlet Jenna, and Tracy Morgan who finally pulls out some funny stuff after years of being off-and-on good o SNL, and you got a great show. Not to mention the guest spots from Oprah to Jerry Seinfeld.",2008
10,Absolutely a terrific show - despite the weak marketing spots NBC is using to promote it.,2007
5,"Many critics and audiences seem to enjoy NBC's highly acclaimed sitcom, ""30 Rock"". It seems to be enjoyed well enough in fact that for a few years in a row, it's earned the Emmy for Best Comedy on Television as well as numerous acting awards for the likes of Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. However, I have to be honest and say that I don't get it. When I mean I don't get it, I'm not implying that I don't understand the plots in the series, I'm implying that I don't get what all the hype is about. I've tried to get into the show for a number of seasons and after all this said and done, I felt like I'm trying too hard to get into it. Maybe I'm missing something or maybe I'm not, but either way, my interest in this show has pretty much diminished. ",2013
2,"The first episode was really good, second one was pretty good, third was average, fourth was average, fifth was average... I don't know who Tina Fey is, so all I can tell is how I see this piece of her work and it isn't particularly good one.",2007
1,On a colleague's recommendation I bought the first series on DVD. Fortunately my new set of three 30 Rock novelty coasters didn't cost too much otherwise I might be a little annoyed.,2010
2,"I watched the first two episodes and found them completely devoid of appeal. Not only did I not like any of the characters, I found them actively irritating. The opening (hot dog) scene of the first episode surprised me: Lemon is established as an obnoxious person, and I'm not sure that was the intention.",2013
10,This show is flat out hilarious. A great ensemble cast that completely delivers. Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are terrific in their respective positions on the show.,2008
3,"Much like its titular subject, ""Marie Antoinette"" seemed to have run out of money in its final stages and suffers from a terrible ending. Coppola continues her exploration of beautiful bored girls, and to her credit, no one does boredom like Sophia Coppola. I like how she compares the opulence of 18th century France to 1980s US/UK. But the film doesn't have the zippy pacing necessary to pull off what was intended to be a fun and frivolous ride. Instead we are left with a tedious and frivolous ride...a disappointing combination considering the wealth of talent involved in the production. On top of that, I will never understand the decision to end the story with Marie's exile and not her execution. We're not even given a HINT of what's to come! No arrest, no explanation of her treason. Sure, many of us know what happened in the end; we don't need to see the guillotine drop. But honestly, if you came into this film without any knowledge of the full story, you would probably leave thinking, ""How sad! Paris Hil---, I mean Marie Antoinette had to leave behind her pretty palace and all those cakes and shoes!""",2006
3,"The film has a fine cast and there are some original touches. The American actors speak unaccented English, without as much as a nod to any alien phones, for instance, despite the late 18th-century French setting. And there may be snatches of rococo music but most of the score is electronically amplified rock with, at one point, a singer belting out the old Frank Sinatra standard, ""Fools Rush In."" There are multiple close ups of lavish plates of exquisitely prepared and presented food. And minute examination of clothing, wigs, fabrics, jewelry, and period shoes -- especially shoes. (The hairdresser who dolls up Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette is a fairy and is played for laughs.) Miniature dogs. Lots of miniature dogs slurping up charlotte russes or other desserts.",2008
4,"Marie Antoinette is the film equivalent of one of those expensive fashion magazines that pepper indie art galleries ¬ñ packed with achingly hip aesthetics but free of meaningful content. The film traces the life of the last Queen of France from her introduction to the French court until her departure from Versailles. If you're looking for serious history though, you're better off sticking to Antonia Fraser's source novel. Wigs, footmen and finery are more often than not filmed to the strains of 80s pop and punk and a pair of Converse shoes even sneaks onto the screen (though viewers will have to be sharp-eyed to spot them). It's the 18th century, Jim, but not as we know it. Marie Antoinette the film shares the obsessions of Marie Antoinette the character ¬ñ shoes, cakes, finery and having fun. It even finishes before the dark conclusion to Marie Antoinette's tale ¬ñ her arrest and subsequent death by guillotine for treason. Sophia Coppola's last film, Lost in Translation, won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay but it's safe to say she won't be receiving any such plaudits for this script. There's barely any dialogue for the first twenty minutes, and most exchanges thereafter are pithy and shallow. Great actors ¬ñ Rip Torn, Danny Huston, Shirley Henderson ¬ñ are given nothing much more to do than push the narrative along its slow path. Dunst's role is mainly to giggle, roll her eyes, and run around in period costume. O.C. characters have more depth. Visually, however, the film is stunning. No, better than that: it's luscious. Coppola was given special dispensation to film in Versailles and all the extravagant finery of the palace's rooms unfolds across your screens. When Dunst has a shopping spree ¬ñ to the anachronistic sounds of I Want Candy by Bow Bow Bow ¬ñ you go with her, feasting on cream-stuffed cakes, delicately stitched shoes and beautiful, patterned fabrics. The film is an orgy of materialism, filmed with the sharp editing and honed soundtrack of a television advert. All of which makes it difficult to see what point Coppola's making. The camera's fetishises the spoils of wealth and yet we're encouraged to feel sympathy for her as the revolutionaries close in on the palace at the film's end. She wants us to think Marie Antoinette's character was misrepresented ¬ñ 'I never said that!' she claims of the famous 'Let them eat cake!' reports ¬ñ but shows us enough debauchery to reinforce the common perception. In fact, it's difficult not to see the director herself mirrored in her central character as it was in Lost in Translation ¬ñ the spoiled Hollywood royalty reaping the benefit of her connections to stuff herself (and her film) with profligate confectionery. Your enjoyment of Marie Antoinette will depend on how you go in. If you're expecting Dangerous Liaisons you'll hate it. If you think you'd enjoy an 18th century hybrid of A Knight's Tale with Clueless, kick off your Converse, stock up on fairy cakes and indulge.",2006
1,"Not only was this movie the worst I movie saw in 2006, it is high ranking among the worst movies I've seen in my life (and that includes such winners as Devil's Rejects and the Hulk). The only redeeming aspect of was the costumes and scenery, everything else was horrible. Kirsten Dunst was not very well suited at all for this character. Her performance came off as very artificial, not realistic at all. The movie's blatant disregard for historical accuracy was pretty disturbing. It didn't focus on the French Revolution at all. That would be like making a film of Abraham Lincon but just leaving out the Civil War. Or maybe I could make a movie about the Titanic but ending the movie before that bad sinking part happens. It's a pity I can't give it negative stars.",2007
8,"Based on the recent Marie-Antoinette biography by Antonia Fraser, Sofia Coppola's film focuses on the personal qualities of the character of Marie-Antoinette and thus participates in the character's historical rehabilitation. Antoinette is seen as a respectful loyal daughter, a loving mother, a patient wife, who had to withstand a flood of vindictive criticism since the moment she set foot in the French court. This depiction contrasts strongly with many prior representations of the character in film (""The Affair of the Necklace"" for example), which show her as superficial, selfish and vain.",2006
1,"How about SOME historical accuracy, dearie? If this film had been limited to those portions possessing Marie Antoinette's character & events in her life, the repetitive sequences reduce to 2 occurrences, its time length would be 45 minutes max. At the length and the material Coppola bestows, it would be tragic showing this to students saying it provides a better understanding of the French Revolution. Heck no it doesn't! What was she & the scriptwriters of this rubbish thinking??? Sofia's warping history is inexcusable as all she had to do was access the Internet or open a book about her subject for longer than a second.",2008
4,"and when she gets there, she gets bored, gossips, reads Rousseau, and has beach-blanket pot parties in Amadeus outfits. I did like the music, there is one inspired masked ball and a good ""watch the sun rise"" scene - the strength of this film is its connection to high school culture, seen through the eyes of a sweet, utterly conventional and finally boring teenage girl, projected from the California suburbs onto 18th century France. This is obviously also the film's weakness: this movie is a beautiful, expensive still life that knows nothing at all about French history, Europe, the Revolution, the Bourbons, how the ancien regime worked, how incompetent wars and not Marie Antoinette's Imelda-Marcos-like shoe fetish ran up the debt, about the conflict in North America with England and Spain, about how leading members of French government actually had brains - the films displays a nitwit, decadent, wig-loving, golden-furniture France as though seen by a France-hater in the Bush administration. As my brother pointed out, the movie also blew the subject of a potentially great movie, which is Marie Antoinette's inspired, sometimes brilliant defense of herself at her later trial. Trying to learn about what happened to the French court from this film is like trying to learn about American corporate culture by watching J.R Ewing's 30 second business deals at the Cattlemen's Club on Dallas. Well sure, politics wasn't the subject of the movie, but why is the ""chick stuff"" buried in diamonds and champagne? That makes these women seem way less tough and intelligent than they actually were in the bloody contact sport of French court politics. As an American watching this in Paris I was struck by the film's lack of historical, political, and cultural sophistication, in which Dunst is in every single frame and it's all one gigantic royal slumber party until the peasants show up in an illiterate wordless mass baying for bread and blood and shaking their satanic harvesting tools. Ouch: The film makes the most sense as a weird allegory of Hollywood inbreeding.",2006
3,"Sofia Coppola made a mistake. Who knew she could? Much has been made of the ker-azee rock 'n' roll soundtrack and modern day touches, but the thing is that Marie Antoinette just wasn't a rock 'n' roll enough to warrant this kind of treatment.",2006
7,"I have seen this film yesterday after a lot of hype up and waiting since in my little town everything comes out a month after the release date. I was looking forward to seeing this movie..a lot. But I must say that the trailers I had seen and the film have a completely different feeling. This isn't a bad film but I think that it well get a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate, not serious enough, being too long, being 'unfinished'... but those are not he bad points of this movie. The style is original and Sofia Coppola succeeds at showing Marie Antoinette's personal side. Her suffering through gossip and humiliation by her husbands lack of 'interest' in her etc. She succeeds in showing Marie Antoinette as a naive girl in the beginning..who hugs her first lady, cries at parting with her dog and announcing that the morning ceremonials are ridiculous. We see Marie Antoinette at the beginning trying to fit in with the strict life at Versailles but further on it's clear that with the gossip following her she stops caring and starts to have fun her own way which leads to her ruin. The negative points of the film is that Sofia Coppola uses the same techniques, the same scenes through out the movie. The trying on of shoes, the hairdressing, the patisserie dishes and the champagne. We see Marie Antoinette frolicking around in the grass too many times. Sofia Coppola apparently tried to show a girl out of touch with reality who lives just to have fun..to escape the wagging tongues of Versailles. But if that was her point the film should've ended long before. This is a biography of Marie Antoinette...even though not a completely serious or historically accurate one...but if Sofia Coppola is trying to show this French queens personality and human side then I can assure you there was more to her than the frilly lace, the satin shoe, the bakery department and the champagne. Marie-Antoinette was a mother who cared about her children and was involved with them..though we hardly we see this in the film except the sequence of her and her daughter on the farm. The relationship and the feelings she had for her husband aren't very clear and his for her aren't very much elucidated. This is a visually beautiful film but I think Sofia Coppola could've delved deeper into this rich personality. In the end you're left with the impression of stepping out from a hazy rose petal fragile dream that from someones tumultuous life. But a dream that's still worth seeing.",2006
2,"this movie was completely ridiculous. as much as i like Kirsten Dunst, she just didn't do it for me this time. besides the much unneeded sex and scandal, the director's complete disregard for historical facts is way out of hand. i understand that making a film requires creativity and that some artistic license can be taken, but in this instance it went too far. the costuming was, i will concede, very well done. i am sorry to be so harsh on a movie for which i had such high hopes, but there it is. another classic story completely hollywoodized with no regard for its viewer's knowledge of the truth. the director assumed that no one would know anything about Marie Antoinette and took massive liberties with it. the innocence with which Marie was portrayed was OK at the beginning, but when she progressed into a slut with no idea of how her actions would affect her people, and everyone around her attempted to keep her in the dark, i had trouble keeping my temper. anyone with any former knowledge of the story should not see this if they value history at all.",2006
2,"I wanted to see Marie Antionette ever since I learned it was being made and Kirsten Dunst was starring, and being a broke college student, I just now gained my opportunity and I have to say that I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a movie.",2007
7,"I've just seen Marie-Antoinette at a sneak preview in Amsterdam. I had heard and read so much about this film that my expectations were probably too high. Hence my disappointment. What a strange mixture! Kirsten Dunst is excellent, and Jason Schwartzman too (as Louis XVI), but what a pity for the rest of the crew: this mixture of accents (American, English, French, fake French...) doesn't help. Coppola tried to give a modern twist to M-A's story (with Rock'n Roll music and Dogma-style filming), but I found certain things quite... surprising, like the masked ball at the Garnier Opera, which was only built in 1874, 80 years after M-A's tragic death... But I thought: Why not? Let's be open-minded... Actually, my main problem was not with this aspect of the film, but more with the fact that it lacks rhythm, and that it's much too long (almost 2 hours!). And there are huge gaps on the historical level, which Coppola tried to fill up with paintings (like the death of one of her children, who's erased from a painting). Could have been 'funny', but alas!... it isn't. But let's stop complaining for a moment. I gave this film a 7 because I still think that some moments are of pure magic, like the part about nature, when M-A seems to find peace in her little 'farm' next to Versailles. In those moments, I had the feeling of seeing Lux Lisbon from The Virgin Suicides (also played by Kristen Dunst...) evolving in a sort of timeless parallel world. Pure beauty! In those moments, I thought: What a queen!",2006
10,"Having trashed two of the three movies Sofia Coppola has directed (I didn't see Lick the Star, yuck!) what made me think I'd enjoy Marie Antoinette? I'm old and worse yet, a male. Certainly not the demographic Marie Antoinette is aimed at, so I found when I ventured out to my local Cineplex to check out Ms. Coppola's 4th go at directing. I figured to use the theater as my personal screening-room on a Friday at noon. Oops! It was a school holiday and I entered one of the smaller of the 14 ""theaters"" into a crowd of a dozen or so chatting high school girls. I had mistakenly arrived 20 minutes early so I had an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussion concerning the ethics paper they were required to write and what they were considering giving up for a week as required by their class. These must have been students at the nearby parochial high school. What public high school has ethic courses? They seemed a perfect audience for a film on Marie Antoinette. The theater continued to fill as film time approached. It filled to approximately ¬æ capacity and I was, as best as I could determine, the only male person of my gender.",2006
10,"i know some people have said that it is entirely eye candy (and what amazing eye candy at that) but it actually does an artful adaptation of the book, which i read before seeing the film. it includes many of the important, beautiful, and sad parts of the book without getting bogged down with all the particulars and names like many of the period movies do. the soundtrack is great, a clever blend of 18th century and modern...the parts are well acted and the American accents rarely detract. If you want a historical account of her life, read the book...if you want Versailles and Marie Antoinette brought to life in a heart-breakingly beautiful fashion, go see this film...it is truly one of the most visually stunning movies i have ever seen.",2006
1,"Having witnessed the greatness (the true and amazing GREATNESS) of Sophia Coppola's directorial debut (Lost in Translation), I felt near giddiness when finally sitting down to watch her sophomore project. And I state for the record that this film is truly beautiful to look at, with some of the finest costuming and set design I have ever seen. Indeed, Sophia seems to have more than made up for the understated tones and look of her first film and gone in completely the opposite direction in as far as Art Direction is concerned. But here the grandeur and wonder stops.",2008
9,"A hauntingly beautiful film about how deep disappointment finds an outlet in ""creative"" frivolity. The combination of rock music and the rituals of Versaille never ""shocks"" thanks to the mastery of the direction. There is also a solid mastery of pacing. The slow progression of the film never bores; it reveals in time. The glory of Versailles is not shown ",2006
1,"Kirsten Dunst never fails to fail. Her role as the Austrian Queen of France was acted with little effort, and carried with a heavy American accent. However it was not just Dunst's lack of talent that ruined the film; it was the lack of plot, the lack of historical consistencies, and the abundant amount of melodramatic shots of Marie walking down the middle of a walkway at Versailles with some pitiful depressing expression born of her own self indulgence. One of the only redeeming qualities of the movie was Louis 16's character which was physically accurate and well acted. The film was successful in portraying that Louis and Marie Antoinette were to young to reign, however that was done so with no plot, and no purpose. One star for effort.",2007
8,"I had reached the point in my life where I could not bare the idea of seeing another historical-costume-drama. The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mello-drama gives me a headache, BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama, with her lovely and off-beat MARIE-ANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar, thinking, ""Wow, life sure was hard back then,"" but you never really can relate to the characters, but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way, so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music (not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did) and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate, other than a mis-cast Rip Torn who's a little too over-the-top. If you've enjoyed her other movies (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES & LOST IN TRANSLATION), then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIE-ANTIONETTE, though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American, but that is not the point, she has created an accessible historical biopic, that people of MARIE-ANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.",2006
4,"Sophia Coppola is clearly a disciple of the Baz Lurhman school of Sloppy Film-making in which the main purpose is to reinvent an actual historical period complete with real characters, some of whom have entered the history/reference books and impose upon it a juvenile ego which is blithely indifferent to facts and marches to the beat of a different drummer, preferably one immersed in Rock. Add a touch of nepotism - male lead Jason Schwartzman is her cousin - and in terms of self-centered insularity Coppola has hit one out of the park. There are some nice visuals but even those have a touch of fakery inasmuch as the existing furniture at Versailles was replaced with Set Designer Blue Plate Special so the best we can say is if you have absolutely no interest in French Culture/History and find nothing wrong with 21st century pop music informing 18th century France then chances are you'll have a ball.",2007
6,"I was so blown away by Lost in Translation in 2003 that I was really looking forward to Marie Antoinette, and I was thrilled to discover when i was in Paris this summer that i could catch it before it opened in North America. While the film is beautiful looking and witty with its pop punk soundtrack, I was ultimately disappointed. I couldn't understand what Coppola was trying to say about Antoinette showing what felt like a hundred scenes of her trying on shoes, wigs, and frolicking in the grass. Are we suppose to pity her, like her, or hate her? Kirsten Dunst performance while strong in Coppola's first film The Virgin Suicides is incredibly weak here as she herself seems to have no idea how she's suppose to play the queen. And while I love Jason Schwartzman in wacky indie movies like Rushmore and I heart Huckabees I just didn't feel like he had the acting chops required to pull off this pretty serious role. I think that Coppola should avoid big flashy films like this in the future; small personal pieces are definitely what she's best at.",2006
1,"Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" is one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. She tries to make Marie-Antoinette out to be some innocent and light-hearted woman who was forced into becoming a queen. Coppola does not make the fact that she loved to spend millions on her material possessions (while the masses starved, no less) a bad thing at all¬óit's what any 20-something year old spoiled monarch does, so it's probably easily justifiable, especially coming from the eyes of someone who grew up on her father's laurels. Only could someone like Sofia Coppola make such a self-indulgent film that tries to empathize with a queen so completely out of touch with her own subjects. I sympathize with Marie-Antoinette that yes, she was incredibly young when she became queen. I don't know how much of a monster she was or wasn't, but I know she was excessive in everything and did not do the best that she could have. An attempt to humanize her isn't an evil attempt, but to make her out to be a martyr is ridiculous. I know a lot of accounts describing her negatively are exaggerated, but this is no better..",2006
10,"I am not really a Sofia Coppola fan, but I did love her work in the Virgin Suicides ( I really couldn't care less for Lost in Translation), but her Marie Antoinette is an experience anyone who loves movies should endure. While on a vacation trip to France to visit a cousin, we decided to go see the film, since it had premiered at the Cannes Film Festival just three days before I got there. My cousin had told me that while the reviews over there had been ecstatic and raves, some of the french press booed at the press screening. To be honest, from that reaction, I immediately thought the movie was going to suck, but then I remembered whatever the critics hate, I end up loving, so I gave it a shot. This movie blew me away! I of course had found out before hand that this film has nothing to do with the revolution, or the beheading of the last king and queen of France. So I went in there with knowledge that I wasn't expecting a boring period BBC dramatization of Marie Antoinette. The film is glorious to look at! The costumes are simply the the greatest costumes ever constructed. We are used to seeing 18th century costumes with wild plooms, and explosive beading and diamonds every where adorned, but these costumes were much more simpler but had a dramatic effect to the eyes ( this is so winning best costumes at next years Oscars). The actors were tremendous particularly Dunst, who whenever I would read threads about Antoinette on here would be bashed because some people said that she cant act, or she could never pull off this role. Believe me, she does (if campaigned right, she could so get an Oscar nomination for this)! She excels as the doomed Queen of France in every way imaginable! She is a frightened teenager in the beginning of the film, trying to please everyone even her overbearing mother (played by the wonderful Marianne Faithful), and you automatically identify with her. Here is a girl who has no friends, no close companions, and while she tries to please her husband, he (jason Swarchtzman, great as always) just blows her off, because he feels that he is not the kind who likes to have sex! So she grows up in the palace of Versailles's, and gets her reputation as a bit of party girl who loves parties, clothes, jewelery, company of women (who wouldn't want that if at 19 become ruler of a powerful decadent country) till finally when she has her children you see her mature and become a loving mother, and a devoted wife. Sofia has made an excellent movie. Sure the script does lack a certain depth to some characters, but remember this isn't your mother's Marie Antoinette. This a new wave Marie Antoinette, and Sofia excels in her vision! But this film isn't for everybody. If you have a problem with rock music used in a period film then you may cringe at some of the moments when the songs are used. Also if you expect to see a full blown bio of the Queen, then you are dead wrong, because this film explores how one minute Antoinette was the toast of France, to the last where she finally accepts her fate as the last and doomed Queen of France. It is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.",2006

7,"Unmissable for Meryl Streep fans. She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun.",2007

8,"We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get's seen and what doesn't. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.",2009
8,"I'm not a girl, so I knew next to nothing about Anne Hathaway, I went to see Meryl Streep and oh boy, did I see her. An inedited Meryl Streep, far, far away from anything she has ever done and that is saying something, isn't it? Blazing with self confidence, Miranda Pristley is a monumental modern queen. Hints of human trouble at her own personal castle doesn't disturb that imperious facade and her extraordinary talent to say ""No"" I may be totally out of touch but I just wanted Anne Hathaway out of the way. It bother me so much. I longed for the young Julie Christie in that role. The Christie of ""Darling"" can you imagine? Then yes you have a battle of the titans not a predictable, tired, phony fairy tale. When Hathaway's boyfriend tells her ""You have become one of them"" I wanted to shoot myself because that's obviously what was suppose to happen but other than different outfits and make up I saw no difference in the girl. I enjoyed very much Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt's performance and I'm recommending the film just to witness Meryl Streep, the greatest actress of our or any generation, dazzles us with an extraordinary new face.",2006
9,"For the past month or so, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie. I love Meryl Streep, I like Anne Hathaway, I though the world of magazine publishing could make a great setting for a movie, and I thought the premise of the book 'The Devil Wears Prada' had a lot of movie potential. So, now that I've seen it, I have to say it is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. The screenwriter has maintained everything that was funny about the book, as well as chucked a lot of the duller subplots, and has formulated a movie that is a great deal more enjoyable than the book.",2006
6,"The Devil Wears Prada struck me much like the industry that provides its backdrop ¬ñ pure surface, well promoted and unabashedly convinced of its own importance. If this was in fact the point of the piece, it is an absolute success.

8,"Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's ""She-Devil"" and 1992's ""Death Becomes Her"", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.",2006
3,"I was horribly offended by this film. Andy's friends act like she's selling her soul to work at Runway, as if it's not just an occupational hazard to submit to cruel bosses here and there.

The production is slick, the editing pointlessly rapid, the cast yawningly toothsome, but where it really lets itself down is the plotting. Was this movie REALLY based on a book? Where's the story? The New York 'fashion scene' is so toadily portrayed and offers so little critique, I wondered just which fashion bigshot it was that the film-makers were going out of their way to avoid offending. But it's when the plot finally creaks and flops into Paris, in what passes for a 3rd act attending - ahem - ""Fashion Week"" that this movie just falls apart. ",2007

Is it even possible for her to do something that is even remotely similar to anyone of her past characters? The answer is NO! Her Miranda Priestley is once again a completely new role that seems made for her and she is so deliciously devilish that you want her in every scene, but we'll settle for a supporting actress nomination come February in a movie that would have essentially been Pricess Diaries 3 without her. A very enjoyable summer fluff movie that is a great escape thanks, once again to the brilliant Meryl Streep.",2006
6,"No! Miranda Pristley can say it or merely breath it and the refusal comes as a devastating blow to her eager bunch of minions . Those moments were my favorites in a film that promises a hearty meal but delivers a frustrating bland souffl√©. Meryl Streep however, makes it palatable and some times right down delicious. Anne Hathaway , so good in ""Brokeback Mountain"", is so uninteresting here that she manages to survive only when she's sharing the frame with Meryl Streep and that's because we're not looking at her. How can the fairy tale be so uneven, how can we possibly root for the evil stepmother rather than Cinderella. That seems a miscalculation of enormous proportions.

Even the NY Times had an article stating that no one in the real fashion world would dress like these people. No plot, no character development and no real fashion. It was a big disappointment.

But I found out that watching this movie you don't have even ONE reason to even smile. It is true that most of the actors did a great performance. But the script gave me the feeling that I saw this movie at least 200 times before. The same old stereotypes. So I spent the evening trying to anticipate the next move.

In the weird somewhat perverse world of high fashion where supermodels - like Premier League footballers - seem to be above the law,the values appear to be those of bling and conspicuous consumption.Vacuous anorexic women are fawned over and the tabloids hover with all the grace of hyenas fighting over a rotting corpse. Why the presumably intelligent Northwestern alumna would want to get involved in this incestuous,self - perpetuating,preposterous so -called industry is beyond my feeble imagination,but get involved she does. She very quickly changes from Annie Hall to Jerry Hall. I would tentatively suggest that most male viewers would prefer her as the former rather than the latter. Because this is not actually a true story,she reverts back to Annie in the end and is saved from eternal damnation - phew.

I think that's because there aren't other shows that have achieved this. Friday Night Lights is very well written and well acted. The music on this show is great. I keep coming back to my love for the characters this show lets us get to know, though.

To be honest, after seeing the movie, I thought it would be cheesy and not all that good. After Breaking Bad ended, I needed a new show to watch and while searching for the best shows available on netflix streaming, this was near the top of the list. And I can truly say even after watching something as incredible as Breaking Bad, I think this show is almost more special in it's own way.It doesn't need violence and drugs to be to be entertaining. I remember right after watching the pilot, I couldn't stop and stayed up till 7 am watching. It will pull you in that quickly, especially if you are a football fan. Not that you cant watch it if you don't like football or don't know much about it. I absolutely love football. Love watching it and played it in high school. But football is absolutely the least interesting aspect of this show. The first episode of the series goes through each day leading up to the first game of the season. After watching it I thought every episode would be that way. But after seeing the end of the pilot I realized the show is about much much more than just football. Football is just a backdrop. ",2014

It's nice to see what lengths a wardrobe department will take to make sure the situation and people are as real as possible, such as using clothing pieces that the actors have already worn previously in episodes. Also, the acting is fantastic! I mean, the entire point of acting is to be truthful under imaginary circumstances and these actors are wonderful at accomplishing that. It's difficult to watch a show when acting is oh so obvious. I have to say though that I admire the men in this series for capturing the true love of football. I've grown up around football and seeing the same love and dedication to the sport come through in the show (and also the same feeling in the movie) is really a ray of sunshine :) Bravo!",2009

Despite what others have posted, the camera-work does not ruin the show. In fact, it gives it a documentary-like feel, which is the point, I believe.

Whoever the casting director for this show is, deserves an award! Taylor Kitsch does an awesome job in his roll of Tim Riggins. I am sure he has a great career ahead of him as does many of the other characters. This is not far fetched as it does deal in real life situations. I really look forward to every weds night and if I can't make that i download the episodes on Itunes! I hope this series continues for years to come! Great Work!!! What can I say except..... I am hooked... Highly recommended A+++++++++++++++++++++++++",2007

This show is a drama, so why on earth would you shake a camera while filming?? We don't have earthquakes here in Texas. And tornadoes don't move the ground either (only what's on top of the ground!) The show's director needs to keep the camera on the character's face long enough so we can see what they are feeling. Isn't that what good acting is all about? This is my first comment on IMDb and it wouldn't let me submit unless I have 10 lines are more?? No wonder so many of the comments are long winded! Maybe a minimum of 5 lines since some of us can get our point across without jabbing away endlessly.",2008
8,"Note: I stay away from describing the plot in any detail because it would be very hard to do so without spoiling elements of it. ""Inside Man"" starts out as a no holds barred, high octane action-thriller, and by its midpoint fully transforms into a breezy, tongue-in-cheek heist movie, reminiscent of The Sting. I felt it to be a little over-plotted, but that comes with the genre - the expected twists and turns are all here, thankfully mostly in non-expected ways. Contrivances abound, and we don't really learn the background of the heist (ie. how the robbers learned about their target) but the story and the overall atmosphere more than make up for this. The meticulously designed plot also compensates for the lack of real 3D characterization - save for Denzel Washington's ambitious policeman hero, who at least achieves a level of humanity throughout the story. The character interaction between him and his sidekick (Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""Serenity"" fame) and the frustrated captain played by Willem Defoe is great with some sparkling dialog. Clive Owen is okay, most of the time convincing as the criminal mastermind, although he spends most of the film wearing a mask. I'd say this film is harmless fun, not your usual Spike Lee fare, which goes to prove his versatility. There is a hint in the back-story at some heavy issues of the past, but it's nothing more than a macguffin that only achieves some slight significance in the resolution of the movie. There is a neat structural trickery in the use of flash-forward scenes, hinting toward the aftermath of the heist without giving away the real ending. It's used sparingly and cleverly. I can highly recommend this movie, it is never boring for a moment, what's more, I was enjoying it so much that as events were progressing toward the climax, I was wishing it would go on. And that's very rare for me in the movies nowadays.",2006
8,"Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like She Hate Me and Girl 6, Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while Inside Man is not up there with Do The Right Thing, Clockers and 25th Hour, it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.",2006
8,"A pleasure from start to finish. An older Denzel Washington has begun to emerge, and his performance here suggests he has many good years left. Clive Owen is terrific as the mastermind. He, and the plot, keeps you guessing. And while there are plenty of clues, they are so well incorporated that very few viewers will see how this one comes together in the end.",2006
7,"Inside Man tells the story of a man named Dalton Russel, who leads a daring bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation. Now he's dealing with disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, who is attempting to get to the bottom of things. When the shady CEO of the bank and a woman he's hired to help him protect certain interests arrive, he begins to discover that there's more to this bank robbery than it would seem. This is the only Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, but trust me, I'll see more, since this was a very intriguing film.",2006
10,"This is a movie that you don't want to miss! Wonderful plot and keeps the audience guessing till the last second. Denzel is at his best playing the NYPD detective, his wonderful acting makes this story as believing as it can be. Clive Owen, what a superb actor! He is so clam, smooth, and elegant in this movie and he actually makes me root for the ""bad guy"" from the beginning till the end. Jodie was good, too. However, she doesn't shine as much as the other two actors, but she is still great. If you have seen the preview of this movie than think it might worth checking out, I'm telling you, this is 100 times better than you think! Get up from your chair and go see the movie, NOW!",2006
9,"Whether I was into the subject or not, there's always a filmmaker at work in a Spike Lee film... he's one moviemaker who never loses sight of being a filmmaker first and foremost, and he's absolutely outdone himself with INSIDE MAN, a taut thriller which avoids the colloquialism that alienated mainstream audiences from some of his earlier work.",2006

6,"Although it sets off pretty well, with Clive Owen talking straight to the camera saying he has the perfect plan to rob a bank, that he is 100 percent sure that his plan is flawless. We always see movies with bank robberies being the criminals risky and edgy, and repeating sometimes the same techniques and same lines. Well with the new optic of this film, one is excited. He planned it so precisely, so extensively he believes there is no possible flail. Well, this declaration is the only thing that the movie can claim of distinguished.",2007
7,"I went in to this film with high expectations due to the cast and whilst their performances were fairly good, the film as a whole was not as great as I'd hoped. As a hostage movie I found The Negotiator with Sam Jackson far more entertaining and the start of Swordfish with Hugh Jackman far more exciting (the worlds largest walking claymore mines). I found the story interesting but once I got the gist of what was going on I just found myself wanting to get to the end, not really caring what happened along the way. As a bank robbery movie I found the whole process of Oceans 11 and Heat far more interesting and cerebral. I won't give anything away and talk about the ending, but when it comes, considering the fairly slow build up, it is one of those ""oh right"" moments but it doesn't hit you like the ending of Planet of the Apes or The Usual Suspects. So to summarise, an interesting journey, but not one to add to your DVD collection for repeated viewing. It gets a 7 mainly for the 2 central performances from Owen & Washington and for Jodie foster looking great for once (good riddance to those awful Silence of the Lambs FBI clothes)",2006
7,"It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society, but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends, it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say. Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me, but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining, and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache. It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary. I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints. The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out. Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time. Denzel Washington is the cop on the case, while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker.",2006
7,"Inside Man, 2006 7/10, 3rd best of 2006, 143rd best of the 2000's, 436th all time That third best is misleading because this was the third movie of 2006 I'd seen. However, last is also misleading because all three were very good movies. Inside Man was directed by Spike Lee. Prior to seeing Inside Man let me give you a list of all the Spike Lee movies I've ever enjoyed watching: 1. Malcolm X 2. hmmm... ummmm... nevermind. So I didn't really have that high of expectations. However, I have to admit that this movie is extremely well made. It's evident from the beginning of the movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie the camera shot changes every five seconds. Normally this would just annoy me, but the editor managed to do this without wasting a single one of those five second shots, and with great accompanying music it was actually one of my favorite opening sequences ever. While the camera work is great throughout what really makes this movie stand out are the great performances by the two leads. Clive Owen is great as a ""not your everyday bankrobber"" and Washington is wonderful, somehow giving an incredibly fresh performance in spite of the fact that he's playing a cop for what seams like the 11th time in his past 12 films. Its an interesting story with some decent twists and better than average dialouge. This is just a very good movie with something for almost everybody.",2006
6,"Too many plot holes to be a really satisfying ""perfect crime"".",2006

5,"Why are so many people raving about this one? I just cannot get past the ridiculous basic premise. Mr Chase has committed an awful deed in his past and the ( apparently ) only way of him being incriminated in the future is if he keeps hold of a piece of paper with the evidence on it. So...he keeps it. Come on!! Anyone with half a brain would have burnt it immediately! Bizarrely, some other reviewers in here have also noticed this yet still gone on to give the film top marks ( one person even says this was the best film ever *despite* this terrible plot flaw!! ) Aside from this...who is this guy leading the heist and why does he know so much about Mr Chase's past? If Mr Chase is aware that someone out there knows about his terrible past then surely that's even more reason to destroy the evidence? The whole story is so frustratingly vague, like reading a book with half the pages missing. Aside from this, none of the characters are at all fleshed out and the film totally lacked tension. Which leaves us having to concentrate on the ridiculous plot. Also, the end dragged interminably. I've given it 5 because it *looked* good, some of the performances were top notch and it made me laugh a few times.",2006
5,"So, audiences and critics alike seemed very happy to judge this movie as Spike Lee's finest. What a laugh! I mean, there's some intelligence here, without question, and humor too. But, Spike Lee's best? What happened to Malcolm X? Do the Right Thing? Clockers or even Bamboozled? See, the main problem with Inside Man is that the film's turns aren't half as dramatic as the film's makers want you to feel they are. Lee simultaneously draws upon and contrasts the film against old heist classics such as Dog Day Afternoon. As a result, we get a film with edges far, far more interesting than its basics are. We get the Sikh bank worker who complains about his rights being violated and the young boy with the ultra-violent video game that the character Dalton (Clive Owen) is shocked by, and so on. At least the film's denouement is full of interesting bits that help compensate for the heist portion's ineffectiveness. Nonetheless, this is Inside Man: confusing, uneventful, and not half as important as it would like to be.",2007
5,"**all spoilers -- do not read further if you haven't seen the movie**** ******* I found the Inside Man to be one of those films that is fun in the watching, but that tolerates no level of analysis over coffee. By design, the film has no dramatic tension. We know in the first 10 seconds that the bad guy gets away with it. We are further informed through ""flash forwards,"" that all hostages survive the bank robbery. There are two prime issues that no one has addressed for me (not even Spike Lee and Mr. Gewirtz his screenwriter). Specifically: (a) Who was the Inside Man? Was it Case (the Christopher Plummer character)? The rabbi? The employee who lied about his cell phone and was severely beaten? The kid who would not wear his hood? Heck, was it the 8-year-old with the video game; (b) How did Dalton(Clive Owens' character) select box 392? Did Case hire Dalton? As the sole purpose of the heist was to get the content of that box, was it dumb luck or was Dalton clued in? If Case is in the Inside Man, why doesn't he get his own incriminating evidence out of the box (shouldn't he have burned it a long time ago?). Any and all help clarifying these two points would be appreciated.",2006
2,"I have never seen any of Spike Lee's prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster's work, and have several of their DVDs.

If this film is any indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to ""get a job"", and stop wasting the time and talent of others. ",2006
1,"My wife and I found this film to be highly unsatisfying. While the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on, when you leave the theater, there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, enormously wealthy head of a NY bank has a terrible hidden secret. Profiting from WW II deals with the Nazis and hiding loot stolen from Jews, he keeps the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safety deposit box in his bank. Why? If he wants this never to be revealed, why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why keep them rather than dispose of them? How did the bank robbers find out his secret? How did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box #232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records show SD Boxes No's 231 and 233, but no #232. Curious. He meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact. All the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily. Wow! Talk about super powers for a detective.",2006
2,"It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers, see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it. Pronto!",2006

I'm a 26 yr old female who generally doesn't watch violent films... but I found the battle scenes so well done and breath taking. I had chills and goosebumps virtually the entire film. I'm with many other reviewers, who felt like they had to contain themselves from shouting ""yeah!"" at times.

I put 1 point because i could not put 0. This film, not only has 0 on plot, 0 on script, and 0 on acting out of 10, but also, the battles and the people fighting look like a cheap 3d studio vectorial animation I could do without any effort. All the people are exactly the same, and you could notice a lack of preparation on the scenes. I was expecting something like troy or braveheart, which are too damn good to compare with this. This is why Hollywood is in the ruin. Another expensive and terrible movie. I watched 23 with jim carrey, and thought I could not watch a worse movie than that.

First, if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest, then yes, it does seem very racist, xenophobic, and the like. However, this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled, nastiest, nationalistic fighters out there, and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's, which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy one-liners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie, it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar, no-holds-barred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate, or balanced, or anything of the sort, and it SHOULDN'T, because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment, in my opinion.",2007

1,"Movies like these often make me wonder about the decision finding-process of an actor. For hypothesis' sake, let's take a journey into Gerard Butler's mind after reading the script: ""Hmm, okay, sounds pretty much like a gory battle film to me. There isn't much of a story, but the public these days really seems to be into epic war movies, probably with the war in Iraq and 9/11 and all. Now, some of the scenes, especially those at the beginning remind me of something I learned in history class, I think it had something to do with Hitler and survival of the fittest. I don't really endorse these values, but the film seems to. Well, I'm only a second rate actor and I haven't had my big success yet, so maybe, taking on the role of Leonidas might be a good idea and an excellent career move, since the film is provocative, to say the least, and even if it turns out to be a bad movie with fascist tendencies, people will still talk about me. And all these months at the gym will finally pay off, because I get to show my sexy body throughout the entire movie. I won't be wearing much, accept for some briefs made of leather and a red cape around my neck. The text isn't too hard either, I don't have to act much, all they want me to do is shout and shout in a belligerent way like the warmonger I see on TV all the time. Yeah, I think I'll give my agent a call. There's nothing good on TV, so what the heck, let's do this flick"". ",2007

1,"When one mentions Sparta and the Greek Cities, there are expectations regarding touch with history. If king Crucifirix from the city of Baluba met an army of million from the kingdom of Zara, I would have no problem but when a claim is made at historic data, I would like that link to be consistent. Well, in '300' this link holds only when it comes to names. Yes, there was a king Leonidas and a despot called Xerxes. Yes, Thermopyle was the place where their armies met. What is not true: the ephors were not priests, they were the only spartan body democratically elected (terms of one year, without the possibility of a second); there were two kings of Sparta; the Greek army was around 6 to 8 thousand of which 300 Spartans, the only reason Leonidas was there was because the other cities agreed to let him command; the Spartans took the field only first and last day; on last day they were not alone (in fact there were a little over a thousand Greeks, thebans and thespians); the immortals were not black ninjas, they were white clad archers with secondary weapons short spear and/or short sword; the immortals strategy was shoot and advance not charge blindly not to mention they didn't look like orcs; there were two spartan survivors of Thermopyle, not one; Leonidas died in the initial assault of Xerxes forces in the last day, not after meeting with the forces sent to encircle them in the rain of arrows ... and so on. The acting is extremely poor in the first part (which introduces us to Sparta, kind of) and absent in the rest where action flows. The visual effects are anything but original, you've seen them before. The dialog revolves around words like 'death' and 'honor' every other phrase and the few metaphors used alongside phrasal inversion make the script look like a medieval play, but definitely not ancient Greek. Why would anyone enjoy this, is beyond me.",2007

I think the ""dialog"" must also consist of digital bits because it is extremely repetitive I think they recorded a half dozen bits of dialog and then just plugged them in between impalements, be-headings, and lopping off of arms and legs. I would be willing to bet that the majority of this films fans could not find both Greece and Persia in an atlas, (hint: look for Iran) nor come within 1,000 years of guessing when the battle took place if they hadn't read about it in the reviews.

Upon seeing the previews of this movie, it immediately becomes apparent that apart from the actual names used in it, the entire depiction of this battle is based upon fantasy. Nowhere among the historical data that remains of the time of Xerxes and ancient Persian empires, do we come across any reference that shows those kings and soldiers as monsters with body-piercing, armors, facial features and demonic behavior that seem to have sprung out from the dungeons of hell.

And then, of course, the acting - if you can call it that. The most remarkable performances by an ensemble cast of unknowns. Gloroious faces that speak louder than words. Well, as you may have guessed. I'm overwhelmed by the experience. Thank you Mel, thank you very much.",2007
9,"Having some Mexican-Indian blood in me, I've always been interested in what I could read about the Aztecs and Mayans and others. But never did I achieve as elaborate a vision in my head, try as I might, as Mel Gibson has with the beautiful Apocalypto. Is it accurate? I've more than just strong doubts in at least one case, but like all good fiction, it probably tells more truth, despite its inaccuracies, than a dozen scholarly tomes. The movie is engrossing and, even more difficult, plausible and quite evocative. I would have bet any amount of money that this movie was impossible to make. And though some have complained that the film's ending involves an historical inaccuracy, I think there was more than enough reason to put it in.",2006
8,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is not a normal movie but a big make-up movie¬Ö ",2007
10,"One of the roughest, toughest art films I've ever seen. Remarkable, sensational. Non a mean task to put aside all the gossip surrounding the man behind this miracle and look at ""Apocalypto"" for what it is : a startling piece of art done by one of the most startling artists of our time. But I was able to do exactly that and sit there open mouthed, totally transported to the world Mel Gibson had in store for me. I don't want to get into any spoilers but let me tell you there are, at least, 4 moments - not merely technical but emotional - that are a first for the movies. There is violence in the film yes, but not nearly as much as in ""Casino Royale"" and definitely more justified. I'll take my wife next time, she stayed home, brainwashed by the avalanche of misinformation claiming it was one of the most violent films ever made. I know my wife well enough to know she will love ""Apocalypto""",2007
10,"The reviewers are trying to damn this movie with an untruthful and insincere mantra about its alleged excess of violence: ""brutally violent,"" ""over-the-top violence,"" ""unrelenting violence,"" ""ultraviolent,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes in the jungle,"" ""unpleasant, pointless, gruesome, and exploitative,"" ""pure, amoral sensationalism,"" ""blood and gore ¬Ö so extreme that they provoke titters of ridicule,"" ""savage cruelty and sadistic barbarity,"" ""lunatic violence,"" ""feverish, mad violence."" You'd think from the reviews that you were going to see two hours of babies being fed through a wood chipper. One went as far as to claim that it made the Saw movies seem like Little Women or some such nonsense.",2006
10,I missed this on first run but just caught it.,2016
9,"Apocalypto is probably one of the ten best movies of the year, a compelling action movie with not only adrenaline, but also brains and heart. Its portrayal of the Mayan culture -- including its strange dress, hair styles, costumes, tattoos, body piercing, and decorative scars, as well as its industry, class system, cities, warfare, weapons, myth, and religion -- provide a bizarre and fascinating anthropological backdrop for what is, at its heart, a solid, thrilling, fast paced old fashioned struggle between good guys and bad guys. The movie does have a lot of violence. But the violence is woven into a story with characters we care about. It is a realistic part of the culture being described. And it is not shown in a hyper gruesome manner, as is much of movie violence today. Thus, I found it much less offensive than many reviews had led me to believe I would. Unlike in some movies, I found the subtitles in Apocalypto so easy to read that most of time I forgot I was reading them. If anything the strange language only adds to the tone of exotic strangeness that pervades this unusually good and thrilling movie.",2006
10,"I will begin positioning myself on this planet. I'm Romanian, European. At school we didn't learn too much about America's Precolumbian history, so, besides documentaries on TV I didn't have other information in the area.",2009
10,"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but he knows how to make an authentically real statement about the human condition. The movie is about civilization and how smaller is better. There are some rain-forest dwelling American natives, somewhere in America where there are jaguars and monkeys. Then there are some ""civilized"" natives, with a huge society of nobles, serfs, slaves and sacrificial victims who get their hearts torn out and heads chopped off on top of a pyramid, for the appeasement of their gods and for the sake of controlling and entertaining the ""citizens."" Our noble small villagers of the forest are ultimately hunted down and enslaved by the more organized, and totally vicious, pyramid builders. This is a story of how one of these villagers deals with the horrific trials that his captors heap upon him. The whole movie is in an ancient native language, subtitled in English, and it lends an air of excruciating authenticity to the happenings. One gets the feeling of being a time traveler, as this 500-year-old world seems so real, with every detail of weaponry, cookware, clothing, jewelry, labor practices, buildings, village characters, and sacrificial ceremonies so obviously researched that it made me feel uncomfortably like I was involved in it all. We are constantly getting the crowd's point of view of all the empire's activities and abuse of its captives and underlings. There is a lot to look at here, from God's beautiful nature to man's nightmarish creations, so it deserves to be seen on a big screen.",2006
10,"I'll keep this review short. I'm dense as to what ""message"" Apocalypto may have been trying to send. I'm not convinced it's a message movie at all. The film's value lies in its limitless ability to pump adrenaline. The movie belongs in the action section when it goes to video. And in that genre, hardly another movie will be able to hold a candle to it.",2006
10,"This excellent movie makes a good case for film fans adhering to a simple rule when dealing with Hollywood's output - try and avoid within reason the machinations of the film industry's hype/pr/press machine or try and see and movie well after the release date. What is up on screen during the film's runtime is so poignantly removed from the modern-day world, despite the somewhat post-modern take on the translation of the Mayan tongue so sonorously spoken.",2007
10,"I'm not here to debate whether Mel Gibson is a good person or not. I am here to discuss his work. As an artist and as a film maker Mr. Gibson has to be given the credit he deserves. Apocalypto is a poetic and unrelenting historical epic that deserved at least a Best Picture or Best Director nomination. How the academy could reward Scorsese for doing a mediocre film about a tired and overdone genre (The Departed) is beyond me. Apocalypto is the only film of its' kind ever made. The only thing the academy could hold against Apocalypto is that there are a lot of action and chase scenes. Yet, Gladiator won best picture six years earlier and contained much of the same. If the academy was punishing Mel for his ridiculous antics and anti-semitic tirades I can't blame them, but why punish all the actors, set designers, writers, costume designers and cinematographers who brought the Civilization of the Maya to life before our very eyes? ",2009
10,"Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.",2006
10,"I found the movie EXCELLENT, I'm still in shock, recorded in Veracruz (in many places) gives a very savage/natural environment to Gibson's story, which it's able to 'take you there' 5 minutes after the movie starts. I would need a vote scale of 11 for giving a fair vote to this movie.",2007
5,"Apocalypto is certainly Gibsons finest work. The end product is a masterwork displaying his true prowess in film making. The visuals are beautiful equaled only by the clever camera display in producing a truly entrenching experience. One can't help but feel supremely involved with this movie, as the viewer is lead through a vivid culture and world of which I personally believe (although perhaps not historically accurate) produced an accurate image of life and its intricacies. This film is relentless, and the violence is not easily avoided by the camera, only adding to the grasping nature of this film, as the viewer is forced, as the Mayans are, to watch the massacre and demise of there brethren, ones own visceral responses in key with those of the suffering (albeit to a much lesser degree, something conjured only within the viewers mind). The only thing that bothered me viewing this film were the immature audience members to my flank, giggling gaily at the sight of an almost bare bottom, or a partially exposed bosom. I feel the gore in this movie was appropriate given the circumstances. I mean, what would one expect from a human sacrifice? Or two people at battle? This film simply more accurately depicts the events that take place during such trying times, and it is this unrelenting quality that I believe the majority of viewers who do not like this movie are maladaptive to. Certainly worth dishing out the seven dollars to see this one, both for psychological viewers, as well as action chasers. 10/10",2006
9,"The movie was well filmed, on a great location, with fantastic backdrops, and is Mel Gibson accurate on all accounts? No, but directors and cinematographers must make changes and put in their montages what they see as a visual story.",2006
10,I was lucky to see this film in a theatre in 2006. What an experience man. Went into without watching the trailer or reading any reviews. This is one of the best survival films ever made. Everything is good bah this flick. An awesome visual treat. The best adventure story with a lot of brutal action. An adrenaline filled chase movie. The last 45 minutes beats all parkour n survival films put together. Thank you Mad Gibson for a wonderful cinematic experience. Its a masterpiece. This movie held me on the edge of my seat from its beginning til the end credits. The waterfall sequence is just breathtaking. It beats the scene from Predator n US Marshals. Those cameramen really deserves credit for the chase scenes. The movie has an amazing n breathtaking visuals and landscapes.,2016
9,Mad Mel's venture into the world of pre-conquest Mayans certainly isn't for the squeamish; it opens with a group of hunters killing and butchering a tapir then after a brief interlude where we are introduced the the hunters and their tribe the violence between the jungle hunters and the raiding party which has come to their area to capture people who are to be taken to the city to be sacrificed. If you are not squeamish however and like an adrenalin pumping action thriller with no obvious CGI in site then this is the film for you.,2010
10,"After reading the reviews on here, and in the TV listings, I was expecting far worse blood guts and gore than there was. As has been said, this is not nearly as gratuitous and sickening as some of those torture porn movies that I can't bear to watch. All the violence in this film was necessarily part of the story and the culture of the time, and anything more sanitised would have been like those old westerns where people fell down dead after being shot and not a drop of blood marred their pristine white suits.",2010
10,"Watch ""2001, a Space Odyssey"", and then watch this movie. This should be a double-feature at every old, art-deco theater around the world. Perhaps there are no two movies that address the human condition with the same insight and scope as these two films do. If you ever wonder what happens between the appearance of the monolith in 2001 and Pan Am docking with the space station, Apocalypto should answer many questions. For each piece of body-embedded jewelry, imagine an iThis or iThat. Think healthcare and war-in-iRaq. Consider the apes confronting the monolith, then the Mayan's confronting the Spanish ships. What next?",2010
10,"I love this movie! Every time it's on, I watch it and I'm fixated and transformed. And though this may not have been Mel Gibson's intention, I want to learn more about the culture on which this is based. Why do I like this movie so much? It's imaginative, it's non-stop, it's realistic, it's believable and it tells a story. The protagonist, Jaguar Paw, is a real hero but he's not just a savage. Mr. Gibson does a magnificent job of showing this tribe of Mayans as all-too human -- from playing pranks on Blunt, the tribe member whose wife cannot conceive children to the raid on the village and the resultant march to slavery and certain death --- and it was all totally gripping. The little boy who plays Turtles Run was so cute and the woman who plays Blunt's mother-in-law was very funny. And I loved Flint Sky, Jaguar Paw's father. But the most credit must go to Rudy Youngblood, the young man who plays Jaguar Paw. I cheered him, I was scared for him and I praised him for his courage. I know Jaguar Paw is only a character but he seemed so real! Some of the scenes are incredibly violent and graphic but this was essential in order to understand fully what was happening to Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives. I see why Mel Gibson fell in love with Costa Rica (though I could never take the heat and humidity). The forests were incredibly lush, the animals were wonderful and the scenery of the raiders' village was overwhelming. I wish a book had been written about the making of this movie or, better yet, a post-movie book in the same vein as ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants."" Right now, Mr. Gibson is mired in a lot of personal trouble; I hope he sees this new review of ""Apocalypto"" and finds some relief from his troubles. I recommend this movie most highly! If there was a ""message"" in this movie, I didn't see it. I just think this movie is an enjoyable, wonderful picture. I watch movies to be entertained (and this one did it wonderfully). If I want a message, I'll go to Mass, I'll read the newspaper or I'll watch EWTN. Messages have their place but this wasn't it.",2009
10,"This film is not for everyone ... this film is not for most people. I watch films for feelings, images, sensation, sometimes knowledge ... This film instilled a feeling in me I will never forget. A Mel Gibson film, very well done. We need to come together. We need to work together. We need to help each other. Do you take life for granted? Are you filled with hate or love? These are the things that will run through your mind as you become engulfed by this film. You will be there. The ugly will make you sick, ready to vomit, (for me, to the point I had to turn away). I wished it to stop, and I have a strong stomach for films. The evil will make you hate the ones causing it, or perhaps you yourself are evil ... then you will take their side and enjoy. The good will make you breathe harder, it will make you stronger. You will cringe as they cringe. You will run as they run. You will become this movie and it will not leave you so easily. This movie makes me think about the end. It makes me realize how good we have it here in this nation. It reinforces how people are so arrogant ... they have no idea how bad it can get. It can happen again. I believe that. The next time you see someone in need of a hand, hold yours out to help. We will all die one day. Maybe all that matters is what you do while your here. Any film is what you make of it. I promise you this: watch this film ... really watch it ... and you will make something of it ... you will say ""holy @#$%"" on more than one occasion ... Take care.",2008

This day brought me great joy and excitement, exactly what a movie should produce in my opinion. It was so outstandingly energizing that i can remember what i was wearing, the color of the sky and my family's attitude! Rarely can one say this about a movie.",2008
