5,"Had they pushed through with just saccharine caring and sweetness for the creature to help it escape, it would have been 6 stars. cast is great. ",2018
1,"I was taught before criticism that you should first bring up the good points. Good points: Cinematography, good actors, great old movie clips and music, great sets, good costumes, and an extremely promising storyline. Unfortunately, this movie missed, when it really could have, and SHOULD have, hit. 
I think from now on I'll choose my movies based upon how they're doing at the box office, and not based on reviews. It seems to be a better indicator of what the public REALLY thinks about a film. 
We're at week 3 and (for such a seemingly magnificent film), The Shape of Water hasn't even broken even. A telling clue. Budget:$19,400,000 (estimated)
Opening Weekend USA: $166,564, 3 December 2017, Limited Release
Gross USA: $12,140,155, 28 December 2017",2018
1,"I really don't understand the hype for this movie. I know del Toro makes some odd movies, but I did like Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage, so I went into this one without reading any reviews or knowing much about it but expecting something decent as a way to spend 2 hours of my life. Wrong!
-The dialogue in this movie is just choppy and facetious. The most cringeworthy conversation to me was between Hoyt and the ugly bad dude. Fragmented threats like ""I will take you out of this universe"" just don't do it for me. Absolutely illogical and nonsensical script. It seems like they said every line in the movie thinking that it was deep and had an impact and was super important... but nothing was really needed for this movie. It could've been filmed without speaking at all and the stupid story still would have come across.
-I just didn't feel the relationship/love between the annoyingly mousy lead lady and the fish dude. She got on my damn nerves, really. So she brought the semi-sentient creature some boiled eggs that she made while she fapped in her bathtub (awkward and unnecessary). And meanwhile the entire f*cking building is on camera, but they never see her repeatedly sneaking in his sealed off room to feed him and even play music and dance for him?!?! serious cringe-fest right there. 
-the black lady Zelda ran her mouth all the time but yet everyone stepped all over her, including the lead (Sally I think? I'm trying hard to forget this stupid movie). Couldn't she ever tell Zelda a simple ""thank you"" for all the millions of times Zelda stepped up for her, made sure she ate, translated for her, punched her time card for her, lied for her, etc? Not once did Sally show gratitude. It's like Sally is a weird, selfish person that became infatuated with a dude that looks like Thane from Mass Effect 2 (yet Thane was 1,000 times more of a fleshed out character than this ""god fish"") and everyone just helped the anorexic mouse lady because she ""found true love."" No one thought this was f*cking weird?? She meets a semi-intelligent FISH in a lab tank and bangs him and has a sick puppy love for him and everyone in the movie acted like that was completely normal. Seriously? In what world is bestiality normal? Just completely idiotic.
-Soooo many unnecessary and useless scenes. Who cares about the mean dude (Michael Shannon) not liking noise and furiously banging his weird Stepford Wife missionary style while he covers her mouth and continually tells her to shut up? And when he got his new Cadillac car with the weird salesman and all the useless banter about its color being ""teal"" not ""green?"" Or the scene with Sally furiously water-fapping while she makes boiled eggs for the weird fish dude? or where M Shannon pees in front of the 2 ladies without holding his d*ck? 
I could go on and on forever and rip this movie to shreds, but I'm already annoyed and tired from writing all this. This movie was completely and utterly stupid, and I wish I could have my time and money back. Fail, del Toro. Big stupid fail. Ugh.",2017
3,"While the basic premise of this King Kong-ish plot, the lead acting (with the exception of the stereotypical and WAY overplayed villain), and the recreation of the 60's time period are all somewhat worthy (three stars worth), there are many oddly-forced and clunky scenes all of which impede the storytelling flow and represent a serious distraction: Gratuitous gore (rotting fingers, headless kitty), homosexual innuendo, masturbation, a bathroom that will hold 7 feet of water by simply closing the door and putting a towel under it, inter-species love at first sight sexual attraction and off-screen consummation, and a Saturday-Night-Live-like song and dance skit (?), among several others. ",2017
3,G. Del Toro has been frequently fawned over as a 'masterful story teller'. I found nothing 'masterful' about it. I absolutely could not hook in to this film. It made no logistical sense at all. It also had a dark and cartoonish feel to it like a Bat Man film. ,2017
9,"In Baltimore, in the early 60´s, the lonely and mute Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is the janitor of a secret government laboratory where she works in the night-shift with her friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer). She lives in an old apartment above a movie-theater and she usually watches television with her other friend, her next-door neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), who is a gay artist. When a creature captured in a South-American river and brought to the laboratory, Elisa feels curiosity and learns that he is an Amphibian Man (Doug Jones). She secretly feds him every night with egg and listens to music in his room, and they become close to each other. However the security agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) is bitten by the creature and loses two fingers. He meets General Hoyt (Nick Searcy) and convinces him to eliminate the creature. When Elisa discovers, she decides to rescue the Amphibian Man and release him in the sea. The scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), who is a Russian agent, decides to help her. ",2018
4,"Take E.T., mash it up with the aesthetic sentiments of Amelie, throw in a dash of The Artist, top it all off with some amazingly open-minded attitudes toward bestiality and you have The shape of Water.",2018
8,"With ""The Shape of Water,"" Guillermo del Toro has crafted a wondrous fairy tale for adults. Many are saying it's not as good as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I didn't much care for that movie and liked this one much more. It's anchored by a marvelous and silent performance by Sally Hawkins, as a mute cleaning lady in a government installation during the Cold War who falls in love and tries to rescue a strange, amphibious being who is wanted by both the American and Russian governments. She's aided in her efforts by gay next door neighbor Richard Jenkins and work partner Octavia Spencer. It's notable that the three principal characters are people pushed to the fringes of society because of various things ""wrong"" with them from the perspective of 1960s America: being handicapped, being gay, being black. That a rag tag group of disenfranchised misfits dare to go up against the government and military establishment of a world superpower gives the film both a tremendous rooting interest and mirrors what's happening right now in American culture, in which groups who previously had no voice in the cultural conversation are now being heard loud and clear.",2017
8,"Guillermo del Toro is back with this visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining adult fairy tale. While this movie does not quite live up to some of his previous films (i.e. ""Pan's Labyrinth,"") it is still a great film in its own right. When one begins to watch the film, the first thing that the viewer will notice is the luscious and stunning visuals. These aesthetic qualities are all the more superb and stunning when one takes a moment to realize that they were done with practical effects rather than CGI. As usual, the visionary style del Toro takes to envision his creature and sets is incredibly impressive. Alexandre Desplat's score, with its simplistic, unpretentious and almost low-key charm, is also thoroughly riveting.",2017
2,"This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a magnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from Sally Hawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, cliché and cartoon supporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash up of ""E.T."", ""Splash"" and ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"", as an aquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military American laboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and Sally Hawkins' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls in love.",2017
9,"To communicate or not to communicate. Sometimes is just out of fear that we don't come close to the ones who can give us exactly what we need. They're different, let's stay away. Sally Hawkins in a magical but beautifully real performance invites us to try, to dare. Guillermo del Toro takes us through the paces with extraordinary delicacy and clarity of vision. Thank you.",2017
7,"Guillermo del Toro is a great director and a good story-teller. Another story, of magic realism, was presented to viewer's eyes, in a captivating and mysterious cinematographic image. I enjoyed watching this movie and few clues remembered me of something: the speechless etherical woman, her attraction to water, how she was found on the riverbank when she was a baby, the signs on her neck and not the least her love story with that half human, half fish creature. Few minutes after the end of the movie I knew: she resembles the little mermaid who sacrificed her voice, long hair, her immortal life etc. for coming in the human world just for a prince's sake, losing almost everything. This time another little mermaid chose to live in the human world, in a humble and mostly inward way. She was turned back to life and taken away to the sea by a man of her kind. Back to the sea, the justice was done and finally the little mermaid found her peace and true love.",2018
7,Here's movie that preaches tolerance. It's a love story between a speechless girl and an aquatic creature. Never mind where will they live.,2017
9,"Whether it be Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Edward Scissorhands, or even Her from a few years ago, movies about forbidden love are a common theme in romantic films. And if done right, they could be extremely effective. The Shape of Water stands as a fresh take on that tale, and yes it works really well as a romance between a government controlled creature and a mute custodian.",2017
10,"Guillermo Del Toro's newest film ""The Shape of Water"" took my breath away. Easily this is Del Toro's finest film since ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and may even be his best in general. This is a film where Del Toro weaves magic throughout with a story he created which is simple, yet layered with such interesting facets embedded in each character, set, and prop as he allows the audience to discover this intimate and fascinating world of ""broken"" people searching for a moment of meaning. Captivating from its opening scenes with haunting visual imagery, and a lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat, one is immediately enthralled by this fairy tale that is not your usual saccharine variety that Disney cranks out.",2017
9,"Today's movie deals with a love between a human and a monster. Many should immediately shout, ""Beauty and the Beast!"", as that's the most well known fairy tale of that same kind of love. When you come down to it, it's seen as bizarre, considering that it's practically two different species that have declared a love between each other. It's a connection that falls off the radar, but you could argue we have connections to a lot of things that are not human. Children love their electronic video games. Pet owners love their dogs. What's different is that those connections are not romantic, but rather mutual. ",2017
3,"The Shape of Water is noted director Guillermo del Toro's vastly overrated attempt to link mythic fantasy to the Cold War era. The problem with the film is its absurd premise: there's a secret government facility in Baltimore which houses an amphibian humanoid captured earlier in the Amazon by bad guy Colonel Richard Strickland (a cartoon, right wing martinet adventurer) played by an over the top Michael Shannon.",2018
10,If I was to tell you about Guillermo Del Toro's new film what would I say.,2017
5,"Okay, first, the good stuff: ",2017
7,"Only Guillermo Del Toro could pitch, ""It's a monster romance picture that feels like Free Willy meets Amelie in the Cold War era."" But you know what? It works...mostly. (You know, other than the central romantic relationship.) Regardless, it is absolutely beautiful and enchanting. There were points where I felt like this story tried a wee bit too hard, but it never strayed far from what it was. It was an un-apologetically monster fairy tale. If you want it to be something else, you will be disappointed. If you let it be what it is, you will enjoy every minute.",2018
10,"Every now and then a work of cinema arrives in theaters that completely challenges one's conception of what a film can be. A groundbreaking technical and thematic masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy director Guillermo del Toro accomplishes something that on paper seems impossible; what is essentially a comedic Cold War body horror musical romance between a mute woman and a mermaid. Not only does the modern master of movie monsters blend such an eclectic variety of genres into a single storyline, but he also does so without any sense of convolution or confusion, exhibiting a technical mastery that allows the film to seamlessly flow between its fantastical elements and social realism as well as stand as a work of art on its own. What Del Toro's latest film offers is not merely a stylistic spectacle, but also a thoughtful meditation on the nature of love and its ultimate lack of boundaries.",2017
8,"Guillermo del Toro created a visually artistic masterpiece with his visionary writing and directing. It's a unique love story told in an amazing setting. Sure there are many plot issues but the message still came across well. This type of film is not my cup of tea, but nevertheless, it deserves praise for its outstanding production. A well deserved 8/10 from me",2018
8,"This beautiful and very clever movie will not be for everyone, but if you are prepared to suspend your disbelief it really is a lot of fun (I see from other reviews that not everyone did this). Sally Hawkins is fantastic (I've loved everything she's been in recently) and Michael Shannon is the perfect stereotyped bad guy. The story is simplistic, sure, but the sets and the cinematography are the real stars here. If you've played the video game ""BioShock"" then a lot of it will look familiar. ",2018
1,"The Last Jedi is obsessed with the fallacious idea that in order to move forward you have to destroy everything that came before. It is as if someone walked into the Louvre and said ""you guys need to stop holding onto the past,"" and then threw a torch down, cackling as hundreds of years of irreplaceable works of art burned to the ground, and then, standing triumphantly on the ashes, drew a smiley face.",2017
1,This movie was just magical.,2018
2,"I just felt like the story was thrown together as they went, because it is some of the laziest and Deus Ex Machina reliant work I have ever watched. I personally didn't watch any fan Theories and just went opening night to be entertained by another Star Wars movie. Instead Rian Johnson serves up a good lesson that quantity is not always quality.",2017
1,"It's hard to imagine a studio being THIS stupid, THIS unwise, THIS disrespectful to a loyal fanbase that goes back *forty years*.",2017
2,"After seeing the unbelievable rating of this movie, I have never felt further removed from the average Star Wars fan. ",2017
3,"I had relatively high expectations of the Episode VIII. Unfortunately, ""The Last Jedi"" has so many plot holes, inconsistencies, ripoffs from previous movies, annoyingly flat and underdeveloped characters and dialogs, that it deserves many bad reviews that it receives from the public. It could have been so much better...",2017
2,"I can't really get into what's bad with this movie without dropping a ton of spoilers, but let me put it this way: a friend of mine went to see this before I did, and when I asked him how it was he hesitated, then said ""it's just a superhero series now"". He was more right than I ever could have known.",2017
1,"This was supposed to be the film that propelled the saga forward into a new direction??? What was wrong with honoring the direction and legends it started?! All this movie does is crucify a heroic character we all loved from childhood, and then leaves us completely unsatisfied with Rey's storyline. Are we honestly expected to believe ""anyone"" can be a Jedi?? Disney needs to stop controlling this ship! It's not supposed to be part of the ""Disney Princess"" history. What a shambles!!",2017
2,"To clarify before beginning my review, I'm a 34-year-old lifelong female fan (not a misogynistic racist fanboy as some people assume of those who are unimpressed with this movie's outcome). The characterization of Luke and some of the others was downright WRONG, especially to those of us who loved the OT. And let's be clear, I'm not an OT purist. I will defend Revenge of the Sith to my death. I watched the Force Awakens 5 times in theaters. I thought Rogue One was one of the best Star Wars movies ever. ",2017
1,"As much as I wanted to love this movie, it utterly failed to deliver on so many levels. Disney, in all its previews, advertised the film as a serious epic focused on Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, with no doubt some appropriate comic relief as always. What they delivered was a farce-tripping over itself with excessive and ill-timed humor such that no scene could ever be taken seriously, even ones that were intended to be. That combined with frenetically paced scene transitions, too many new characters, and wasted sub-plots (casino scenes), meant the main story and characters were left undeveloped with few burning questions answered. The main premise, equivalent to a slow motion car chase with the First Order chasing the Resistance until they run out of fuel, was absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps most unforgivable of all was the treatment of Luke Skywalker. While initially promising, his diminished role and ultimate end were insulting to his character and inconsistent with everything we know about him. Shame on Rian Johnson.",2017
1,"Wow this is getting hammered by reviews and now I understand why. Given its still in week 1 and most of the early reviews were all paid for and fake, the fact that this is at:",2017
3,"The Last Jedi is one giant cinematographic anticlimax. Each sequence had a twist for the sake of a twist. Each time, the chosen twist was always the lesser of the interesting possibilities the resolution could offer. Each scene had a build up that lead to an anticlimax.
Examples:
1) Set-Up: Luke gets his blue light saber back. The biggest buildup at the end of The Force Awakens. Two years in the wait to see what Luke is going to do.
Anticlimax: Luke throws the light saber away over his head in a slapstick manner.
2) Set-up: Is Admiral Holdo a traitor?
Anticlimax: Apparently she's not, she just wanted to hide her plan (of saving The Resistance) from everybody without any apparent reason, creating forced conflict.
3) Set-up: DJ explains the war economy to Finn and Rose and shows that the weapon dealers sell weapons to both The First Order AND The Resistance.
Anticlimax: Finn and Rose ignore it completely and pretend this discussion never happened.
4) Set-up: We finally meet Snoke, the new biggest Dark Side villain of the galaxy. Who is he?
Anticlimax: He's nobody, Snoke is killed off in the most anticlimactic and convenient way possible; and this in the middle of the movie!
5) Set-up: Rey is finally getting the answer of who her parents are.
Anticlimax: She is a nobody. Her drunk parents sold her to Unkar Plutt when she was a child. They then died and were buried somewhere on Jakku in a mass grave.
6) Set-up: The big climactic build-up of the battle on Crait where Luke walks towards The walkers of The First Order. The music builds and Luke is ready to do some serious force-s***.
Anticlimax: Luke was using a projection of himself, Force-broadcasting it from Ahch-To to leave some time for The Resistence to escape. This drained his energy and killed him apparently.
The Last Jedi felt like making love to the woman of your dreams, and right before you come she stops you, pushes you away, and tells you to leave for not apparent reason. You are just dumbstruck thinking ""What!?""
The Last Jedi is a mix between Return of The Jedi and the prequels. It had the potential of becoming ""something truly special"", but like the prequels, all the decisions that were made were the least interesting and in some cases the most ridicule ones. For example: The whole crowd started to lough in mockery when Superwoman Princess Leia flew through space... Casting A-list actors like Benicio Del Toro for small roles is another example of a weird choices.
The rhythm was off. Wen the subplot started about Finn and Rose going to Canto Bight, the movie started to drag. Then, when the Crait battle started, everything was rushed. All the interesting questions The Force Awakens asked were answered in a rush.
The Last Jedi is a ridicule movie, a 2h32minutes long awkward an weird cinematographic experience.",2017
2,"First of all, I'm a big Star Wars fan, and I think the prequels were good, because they were building up to something, Vador. But this... Where is THIS going...? It's the first time in my live that I've taken the time to write a review, because there is no way this movie deserve his 8.1/10 rating. And five years old kids don't come to rate movies on IMDB, so people were clearly paid to rate this movie past 5 stars.",2017
1,DO NOT READ MY REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE SPOILERS,2017
4,I've read articles saying the THE LAST JEDI is being rejected by fans because the fan theories all turned out to be incorrect. That's wrong. THE LAST JEDI is being rejected because it didn't deal with any of the questions that THE FORCE AWAKENS spent so much time asking. Who are Rey's parents? It doesn't matter. Who is Snoke? Shrug. We're going to save Luke Skywalker until the last few seconds. Why? So he can spend almost the entirety of the next movie doing absolutely nothing.,2017
1,How this script made it past everyone at Disney I'll never know. What happened to the Star Wars that told a coherent story and focused on characters that we truly cared about? ,2017
1,"A movie that tries extremely hard to be politically-correct, while being inclusive and embracing diversity, that it forgets what it means to be a part of the Star Wars lore. One of the greatest protagonists in cinematic history has been reduced to an uninspiring hermit drinking milk off an alien-cow-dinosaur hybrid. Supreme Leader Snoke could potentially be a greater villain than Darth Sidious but unfortunately killed off, Darth Maul-style. Meanwhile, forgettable and insignificant token characters such as Finn and Rose were kept alive all in the name of ""multiracial-diversity"" and ""political-correctness"". And don't get me started on the space battles: It was vomit-inducing.",2017
1,"I was totally baffled during the movie and when I walked out of the theater, had become lost of thought and empty of any emotion - perhaps because I was in a state of shock. I won't regurgitate the many valid negative points that previous reviews have already discussed. They are all valid and should be up-voted every single instance. I just want to comment on how utterly disgraceful it was for the handling of four main characters:",2017
2,"Congrats for killing another franchise. The movie was horribly edited, half of the things happening on screen are literally pointless and theres NO character development whatsoever. Rey becomes a jedi after a 15 min meditation session with Luke, Kylo kills Snoke (wich was supposed to be stronger than vader and sidious) and this somehow doesnt change anything AT ALL. But hey, the 2.5h of screentime are filled with poe doing poe things, finn and a forgettable chinese partner going to the forgettable space-las vegas and doing pointless things that have nothing to do with the plot except giving benicio del toro some money, and leia somehow flying in space. Oh also dont expect explanations for the multple questions you may have had after seeing TFA. 13/12/2017 is the day Star Wars died, good job mickey mouse.",2017
3,"I can honestly say that i have never left a movie theatre on any previous occasion and been angry. When I left the theatre one of our group asked me what I thought, i usually have something to say about what we've seen. I errupted, the anger was welling up inside. I can't really convey in words, the level of disapointment. ",2017

I want to go through the movie one point at a time:",2017
10,"I've just watched the whole series in one go and I wish there were more episodes. The writing is fabulous - witty but naive, cruel but touching. ",2017
10,"Spectacular. I started watching on a whim when I saw the Netflix banner and got so caught up that it's suddenly 5:00 AM and I just finished the finale. This is a younger version of Bonnie and Clyde except PLOT TWIST the crime has a reason and one of the protagonists is a would-be sociopath who sets out to kill the other. The acting is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, there are lesbian police detectives whose lesbien-ness isn't the main focus of their characters. What more could I ask for? I'm sure that people are going to complain about the romanization of violence/crime/anarchy or whatever, but I would argue that this show does exactly the opposite. Everything has consequence in this tragic tale, from the young protagonists' actions to the adults whose mistakes have irreversibly damaged the lives of their children and the people around them. The performances are stunning. I've only ever seen Alex Lawther in Black Mirror, but I look forward to his future projects. That dude has a long career ahead of him, and so does Jessica Barden. A side note: As someone in their late teens, its refreshing to see actors who actually LOOK like teens playing teens. Every other piece of media shows airbrushed adults in their mid twenties as the ""average teen"" and it gets exhausting (I can confirm that almost all of us look like baby eggs with faces, even as a freshman in college). This is dark, this is real, this is relevant, and this is beautiful. P.S. This is not a rigged Netflix review. I am ACTUALLY giving this 5 stars and I am writing it of my own volition. Peace out",2018
10,"From the first five minutes, I was hooked. And I was hook line and sinkered into thinking it was going to be a teenage angst road movie! Not so!
The entirely Adult theme, off kilter storyline and the entirely believable yet totally surreal characters draw you inwards and downwards on an inescapable maelstrom of a tale that forces you to care about the protagonists and their all too tragically inevitable fate.",2018

9,"Well have just finished watching all 8 episodes. I can see the audience , young (me 60), that the producers were aiming at . However if you like your stories in the K Dick / Missfits, style then you will enjoy this. I have given it a 9 /10 rating as there were a couple of ""odd"" occurrences, that I will not elaborate here, for they were minor and could spoil things. Give it a go.",2017
10,"We binged this one. We just couldn't stop watching. There is so much that is wonderful about this drama. Excellent writing and acting. The locations and sets are uniquely fabulous. It doesn't feel like a British TV drama, more like an American road movie. Great pacing. A wonderful mix of humour, darkness and pathos. Truly fantastic.",2017
10,"Well, frankly it is easy to binge, short 8 episodes put online altogether. It feels a little bit weird kind of a ""chumscrubber"" or ""thumbsucker"" movie (if you're familiar with it) but a bit longer, with different story arcs of course. ",2018
10,"This modern British teen ""Bonny and Clyde"" esque comedy/drama has me feeling so many things. All in the best way possible. The show does so many things right! Firstly, the chemistry between James (Alex Lawther) and Alyssa is something so fresh. Their match was not destined to be. What this show does really well is how it kind of sticks close to reality. Our expectations are almost never what we want them to be. The End of the F***ing World also has some great humor. Mix it all together with great casting, screenplay, relatable characters, and action...that is what you get. Fresh, Daring, New, and Thoroughly enjoyable!",2018

7,"I feel that people don't understand what 10/10 and 1/10 means, because all the reviews I saw seemed to be either one of those. It's not a bad show, actually it is quite entertaining. Is it shocking and brilliant? Is it thought provoking? Not really. I mean I guess it's bit of a criticism on the modern world: how we're all shallow and we don't connect and it's hard to find meaning in life etc. etc. but it's not really profound or anything. It's kind of just stating the obvious. And yes ofc love and 'true' and 'real' connection are the answers to all of that, but U know, everybody knows that too. However the actors are good and the characters are fun to watch and they definitely have some character development. Both of the main characters are quite unlikable in the beginning, but at the end of the season there really is a feeling that they're likable, almost lovable people. Also the couple do have a really nice chemistry, which is nice. And it also has the classic theme that for one to be good you have to first also do bad things and know your evil side, your shadow, although it doesn't necessarily convey that that well. Overall it's a good first season, not amazing, but I look forward to seeing what the next season will be like.",2018
10,"Some people may say this is a story about a teenage sociopath who wants to progress from killing animals to murdering his new girlfriend. That may be our starting point, but what unfolds is transformative for the two leads. While both James and Alyssa kill, they each do so out of caring, not hate. It's often the parents and other adults who are the villains of the piece. Those who have had the time and experience to develop empathy, but yet haven't.",2017
3,"After reading so many good reviews here and in Rotten Tomatoes, I gave this show a shot. Sure, the premise is kinda original, but falls apart very quickly
By mid-series you still don't know what these kids are expecting from life (apparently they don't expect nothing)
Most of the stuff that follows mid-series are predictable, and the ending....omg the ending...
Perhaps this series is aimed to emo millennials or something, because honestly I didn't see any magic or surprise, or even a decent plot. The original idea from the beginning is completely lost and ends up being the most cliche it can be",2018
3,"I was expecting it to get better, as some people said, by episode 3. Thing is, there is no climax. The whole series is flat and forgettable. Characters are stupid, the script is pretty much ""fuck off"" all the time. They are just two edgy teens, just as I expected. And that end? Lame. Wouldn't recommend to anyone over the age of 16.",2018

So said the papers...
And more good reviews...
So I gave it a go.
Biggest dissapointment ever.
Despite having good actors in it I couldn't watch it for more than 2 episodes.
And that's only 40 minutes in total.
I can't imagine anyone over 16 being interested in it.
It looks like a school project where they want to shoot a wannabe American road movie.
Even the neighborhoud they lived in was chosen to look like the white picket fenced suburbia.
And it's no accident they stop to eat at an American diner.
I don't know why the writers are doing this.
Is generic Hollywood crap what they're aiming for in the UK?
I hope not, and hope these tallented young actors spit out this piece of bubblegum and move on.
Or they might end up like Idris Elba, filling his pockets playing charicatures in blockbusters with an American accent.",2018
4,"A silly and ridiculous series, when we watch this show, we have to ask ourselves what we learned from it and what the positive aspects are. The answer is nothing positive, but this series has had a lot of disadvantages, such as: corruption, family anomalies, disrespect for parents, encouraging the killing of animals and insisting on violence and theft,",2018
4,"Yeah it's basically a modern version of Harold & Maude but instead of an elderly 'free- spirited rebel' its now a millenial 'free-spirited rebel'. The girl is insufferable. Arrogant, cruel, foul mouthed, self centred....and utterly unsympathetic. The guy is basically autistic with the occasional murder fantasy thrown in to prove he is a psycho. It really doesn't sit well that this is kinda played for laughs, as well as the numerous animals he has murdered as a child. ",2018
2,"I had high hopes for this one but it ended up painful to watch. Predictable throughout and the characters and dialogue felt way too obviously tailored to whatever Netflix' big data algorithm told them would appeal to their viewers.

9,"With a total duration of around 160 minutes, Season 1 is more like a movie rather than a TV series. An incredible movie, actually.
I didn't think I was going to like this so much, because I thought it would be an exaggerated outcasts plot. And it is, but it's so well-done that it turned into something truly beautiful and great.
The acting is excellent. I think the two main characters will stay with me for a long time. Most secondary characters are a bit polarized, and also exaggerated, but it works nevertheless with the tone of the whole thing.
The plot-line flows easily and at the perfect pace. It almost never gets boring, and once you're in the ride you just relax and follow it. The police angle was also very smart and well done, in my opinion.
Finally, the soundtrack is simply amazing. It got to me at a personal level. I'm so glad to see that there's still many people out there who kind of sees music in the same way I do.
The ending is very unconventional. I can't say I loved it, but it is really brave, and I admire that.
I highly recommend watching this. It's weird when it needs to be weird, smart when it needs to be smart, and emotional when it needs to be emotional. It all works perfectly.",2018

8,"There's plenty of people on here that are taking the series and its historical accuracy too seriously, even to the point that someone seems to figure themselves as more well informed than the Roman historian Mary beard (looking at you Allen). I'm currently undergoing my Masters in Roman History, and NEWSFLASH pal, ancient Britain was famous for its warrior queens (esp. Cartimandua and Boudicca) which are mentioned in Tacitus - do your homework and stop thinking you're an expert because you've read Herodotus lol. Also Rome pooled auxiliaries from all over the empire including its North African provinces, and due to the migratory nature of the peoples from Sub-Saharan Africa, and the plethora of reports about peoples below the desert its not unlikely that these people wanted to live in the prosperous North African provinces of the Roman Empire and took up military service with its lucrative benefits. Either way, its not the point; the show captures the perceived mysticism and magical Roman conceptions of Britain well. It was seen by Roman and Greek writers as the land at the end of the world where magic and human sacrifice among other abominations occured. Yes the show deviates away from certain historical events, but the invasion of Claudius was not all that well documented, and it still captures the internal strife and rivalry well, as well as the mysterious prominence of the druids in celtic culture. It's quite sad really how many people are trying to be historians while watching a sky drama: the cast is good, some of the characters are endearing, and for the shows early days, it looks promising. Stop trying to step into academic fields that you're clearly not all that well acquainted and just enjoy the drama. jheeeeezus.",2018

Everything is dragged out,dreary and quite frankly just silly.Anyone expecting high energy action based tension is going to be very disappointed in this snooze fest and if i hear 'Gods' one more time i'm going to bang my head against the wall.This could've easily been a 2 hr movie and even then wouldn't have been very good.I gave it a 3 rating then afterwards thought i was being generous,by the way i don't review this is my first ever, more as a warning as much as anything else.Happy viewing lol",2018

It's a tongue firmly in cheek romp through Celtic Britain. The characters are either evil or hilarious with Zoe Wannamaker having some of the best one liners. Surely, anyone can see it's not meant to be taken seriously, especially after seeing Veran and Divis play their parts like characters out of a play that a stoned Shakespeare might have written. It's a fantasy epic with great characters and scenery and a perfect title song by Donovan. The song alone should tell you that you should just go with the flow and have a laugh,something a lot of reviewers surely need, along with a few beers and a good lay. They've totally missed the point. Don't let it put you off. I'm really looking forward to another season. It's not game of thrones but it's never claimed to be.",2018

The locations also grate, looking about as little like Kent as possible, the Welsh Slate quarry doesn't look much like Canterbury, I agree.
 The Cantii apparently don't bother with woad, leaving that to the Atrebates, for the convenience of colour definition. The second legion augustus fighting in Kent?Oh, and whoever styled the Britons clearly didn't read Ceasar's descriptions, not a soup strainer moustache in sight!",2018

Historically Vespasian was the legate to the second legion, and then went on to become the emperor of all Rome. That scene was literally the writers, warning and declaring viewers that the show is not or ever going to be historically accurate.

Britannia was never claiming to present a historically authentic depiction so don't go in expecting a ""Rome"" or anything close to it. It's clearly using the historical setting to drive the supernatural elements and I'm ok with that. Shows that are ostensibly supposed to be historical such as ""Vikings"" that still get things terribly wrong do provoke my ire for it, but not this because it was never in the same category to begin with.",2018

Well I bet you already know how is going to end, don't you? Beautiful landscapes when we can see them. The night scenes are irritatingly dark and they are many. The plight of Rosamund Pike's character - who loses her entire family in a harrowing opening scene - kept me going. She is strong and powerful but Christian Bale gives a performance that is just that, a performance. I like him as an actor when he's good. Brilliant in The Fighter, terrific in American Psycho but embarrassing in Exodus: Gods And King as Moses. Here I needed to believe in those flashes of empathy he seems to insinuate but I didn't. I was too aware of him, the actor. I don't know if I can I explain it but if you look at him walk away at the end of the movie, you'll know exactly what I mean. As far as I'm concerned not an ounce of real emotion. Naturally, I would recommend for you to check it out yourself, I'm often quite alone in my opinions.",2017

5,"As a child of the Sixties, I watched a lot of Westerns, from 30 minute tv shows like Have Gun, Will Travel to the hour long Bonanza and Gunsmoke. I saw the Hollywood films of Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich, John Sturges and later, the Italian-based movies of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. So as I was watching Hostiles, the new film by Scott Cooper, starring Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi, I kept thinking that Sturges or Aldrich could have told the same story in 90 minutes instead of 2 hours--and made it move. Because this film is verrrrrry slow and more than a little episodic: Every 30 minutes there's an act of random violence followed by scenes of riders walking their horses through gorgeous Western vistas or setting up then breaking down their campsites. That's the movie. As a woman whose family is wiped out by a group of renegades, Pike does fine work, though oddly the costume department decided to purchase her wardrobe from a fashionable, high end Western wear store. As a hard-bitten cavalry officer on the verge of retirement, Bale mostly grunts, glowers or poses against those same majestic vistas. And Wes Studi, playing a dying but stoic Cheyenne chief, is allowed the occasional cough to remind us he's sick. All in all, despite the scenery and Pike's performance, it's an interminable slog.",2018

Along the way the party encounter wild and dangerous Comanche ""Indians"". The movie is intense and I surmise Bale will be nominated for an Academy Award for this turn. Wes Studi, as always, as the ailing Chief, is marvelous, understated and ever so powerful. Rosamund Pike is superb as a deranged widow who is collected up by Bale's party. Her presence in the story seems like a distraction from the original mission or orders, but it's a movie and we have to have some man/woman tension and whatever then derives from that, of course. The movie sometimes slows down a bit, and lingers, but it always recovers, and overall - see this movie. And the music score is perfect.",2017
2,"Where are all these positive reviews coming from? I think we know where----paid writers pumping this bad oater.
So we're thoroughly immersed in Captain Blocker's white-hot hatred for the injuns, and we're told why we should hate on 'em, too. Disembowelings, flayings, skinning-alivings.....blah blah..OK GOT IT. 
We're also told why the injuns hate us whitey----and it's the same old tired "" took our land, were mean to us"" Yawn. OK GOT IT.
Within one ambush from the Comanche, Yellow Hawk and Blocker are trusted companions, tossing their hatred to the wind, Hollywood style. Yeah,like that would happen. Has anyone in hollywood actually read first-hand accounts of indian raids, or Army assaults?. Yeah NO----they haven't. 
by the end of the film, Blocker calls his bitter enemy ""Old Friend"". This kind of pie-in-the-sky-kitties-n-rainbows mentality seeps in to this movie and seals its fate to the $3 DVD section at Walmart. ",2018
5,"Scenery and cinematography were stunning. Casting and characterizations were first rate. However, the plot suffered from some unbelievable elements that spoiled the picture",2018
1,"The script writer is from the U.S. east coast (Virginia), and the script appears to be telling in that regard. Reviews at Indian Country Today are pleased at how the Cheyenne captives being returned to their homeland are portrayed. I concede that, but otherwise the movie plot is historically and geographically preposterous from the get-go. The writer apparently has never studied Wikipedia, much less read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown or An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. The premise of massacre of white settlers (1) by Comanches, (2) in 1892, (3) in either eastern New Mexico or a well-watered part of other New Mexico, fails. The Comanches were subdued in northwest Texas and adjacent eastern New Mexico by the late 1870s, and thereupon fled to Mexico. Moreover, preceding atrocities alluded to and productive of Captain Blocker's initial Indian hatred were mostly the other way around, which is to say a preponderance of white atrocities (Brown, Dunbar-Ortiz, Wikipedia). I didn't catch the dialogue exactly, but at one point in the movie I thought the name Billy Dixon came up as a Captain Blocker friend the Indians supposedly had killed in savage fashion. If I have that wrong, then I have that wrong. But if I have it right, the fact is that Dixon was one of the hunters who nearly exterminated the bison, who mainly fought Indians who were trying to stop such extermination, and who died ultimately in his 70s of old-age pneumonia. Then, without going through or across the Rockies from New Mexico to Montana, which thus requires traveling through eastern New Mexico, eastern Colorado, and eastern Wyoming, the cavalry and the Cheyenne they're escorting traverse a mixture of semi-arid lands with topography, or apparent Rockies foothills with trees. They somehow don't cross many major roads or trails, somehow don't encounter many other people or signs of white civilization, and somehow miss or mostly miss Colorado Springs (where ""America the Beautiful"" was composed in 1893), Denver, Cheyenne, and Laramie. At best, this puts them farther east on a route through the mostly treeless and mostly flat far western Great Plains, except that's not scenery that's in their journey or the movie. Parts of the movie that weren't filmed in the New Mexico or Colorado Rockies, or vicinity, were filmed in Arizona which is not on the way to Montana.",2018

The unlikely travel companions meet up with a grief-stricken woman in the burnt remains of her home. She cradles a dead baby in her arms and hovers on the brink of insanity. Worse, the unstable and dangerous men who massacred the woman's family are now on their trail. Sympathy for the woman as well as the desire for self-preservation begins to unite the Cheyenne and the soldiers.",2017
9,"Forget the talk of the film being slow, this isn't an action film or an old school shoot 'em up western, anyone looking for that should search elsewhere. Whilst there some great action scenes, where hostiles excels is in setting the tone for an early American world where law and order rest of gun power.
The cinematography is exceptional, meanwhile Christian Bale is superb playing a army captain who is seemingly tough and unflinching but shows an undertone of melancholy, Rosamunde Pike pulls of a great performance as a woman thrust into the ugly world of war and anarchy by a brutal attack on her family home, a scene is exceptional and unapologetically shocking.
Overall the film is about the futility of trying to civilise a wild land built on violence, and about the tragedy and the sheer pointlessness of conflict against fellow man.",2018
3,"Being a western movie lover this left me disappointed, the movie never really pulls you into and storyline can't be saved by some decent acting in the movie, although not Bale's best performance anyway, there are some historical inaccuracies to begin with and movie is basically Bale on a two hour camping fest with a lot of violence, I expected it to be a violent movie but it is just too overplayed, just relentless killing and sadness, by the end of the movie I was ready to hang myself. The comparing the movie to Unforgiven is a Joke, it does not even come close",2018

Suspenseful, adventurous, romantic, emotional and dramatic; better than nearly all of the old 1940s and 1950s westerns; and more classy than the most of the post-Wayne, Stewart, and Scott ones. Unlike many that story line is primarily about revenge or some criminal motive; Hostiles is about a mission and survival.",2018

Lots of dead people and grave digging duty but since we don't care about the characters it is pointless carnage; I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the pointless carnage. Pointless carnage throughout. Forced and cliched, with underdeveloped characters and illogical progressions, this movie never overcomes the PC baggage that ties it down. Minus two stars because of the PC, minus two more because it is depressing, minus one because it is slow, minus one because it had potential but never lived up to it and minus one because some fine actors weren't given a chance to shine in such a dimwitted cinematic vehicle. That leaves three stars. Is that too many?",2018
7,"I was going to make a list of people who made extraordinary things during the same period that Tonya Harding monopolized the headlines but then I thought it was a pointless exercise. Charles Manson will always be more famous, much more than Sharon Tate. That's the world we live in or maybe it always was. The sadness verging on horror of of the Tonya Harding story will win, fascination wise, than any kind of kindness from anyone anywhere. Now that out of my system let me say that I Tonya is an entertaining harrowing tale directed by Craig Gillespie and his extraordinary cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis with, clearly, Martin Scorsese in their minds and hearts. Margot Robbie is terrific and Sebastian Stan as the husband from hell, superb but it's Allison Janney that creates a character that is impossible to take and irresistible at the same time. She is spectacular. So, that's more than enough to recommend I Tonya but if the Tabloid Times is something you subscribe I will highly recommend Gus Van Sant's To Die For and Michael Ritchie's made for television The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.",2017

In hindsight, I am glad I saw it as the film was exceptionally well directed and the acting was occasionally brilliant. In particular, Australian actress Margot Robbie was simply amazing as Harding—turning in the sort of performance that could mean an Oscar nomination. Likewise, Allison Janney was amazing as wellplaying Tonya's incredibly despicable mother. You really have to respect the great job both of them did in the filmas well as Robbie's learning to skate well in order to make this movie.",2017

The star of the movie was not Margot Robbie's Tonya, but Alliison Janney, whose protrayal of overbearing/vindictive mother of Harding was uncanny and mesmerizing. The whole movie should have focused more on that dynamic, then the rest of the film. Sebastian's Jeff Gillooly was a little unwatchable, as half the performance was him beating her. Rest of the film was more the aftermath of Nancy Kerrigan incident. Don't expect many scenes with Nancy Kerrigan character, its more a Tonya Harding centric pic. Worth watching on DVD, maybe for Janney's performance.",2018
6,"I finally have watched this movie and I can say I am deeply disappointed. I, as a big fan of figure ice skating was really thrilled about this movie and expected much more. If you don't know much about Tonya Harding's story, I suggest you read about her and watch some of her old and new interviews and you'll understand why I didn't like the movie. ",2017
10,"""I, Tonya"" is amazing. Margot Robbie gifts a career defining performance. Margot plays disgraced 1994 US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance as Tonya is fearless, vulnerable, sad and poignantly flawed. Harding is notorious for knowing about the attack upon US figure skating Champion Nancy Kerrigan which led to her eventual ban from competitive skating which was her life. ",2018
9,"Going right into another sports movie; this is if someone were to make a ""Goodfellas"" styled film about a professional ice skater, but snorted a little extra cocaine. It is insane and amazingly edited. Hilarious, surprising that this is an actual true story, and in the end I won't lie that I held back some tears just from Margot Robbie's performance alone. If I had a small gripe, it would be some of the CGI used; while not necessarily bad, it was noticeable at times. Other than that, I loved this movie from beginning to end.",2018
7,"Tonya Harding is known in figure skating as the 1st woman to land a Triple Axel in competition, but also for her involvement in the physical attack on fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan. This docu-drama is based on interviews from Tonya, her mother, her coach, and some of the co-conspirators, mixing them with re-creations and some historic footage. It shows the difficulty of a poor kid battling into a sport dominated by upper-middle class princesses. While mostly taking the word of the interviewees, the director inserts hints that Tonya may not be as innocent as she claims. There is also an interesting undermining of Tonya's complaint about Nancy being despondent about winning silver at the 1994 Olympics - listen for the placing announcements before the final skate.",2017
3,"What kind of movie was this supposed to be? Because it bounced back and forth between dead-on realism (Rawlinson) and raw violence (domestic and parental) to satire? (Harding's interview recreations) and absurdist comedy (Eckardt - good lord!) to the point where I just didn't know what the filmmaker(s) were trying to accomplish. I learned nothing new about Harding's story here, so maybe my POV on the story was the target? If so, you need to pick a tone and stick to it. Because I felt continually jerked around, I came out of this movie within antagonism toward the whole enterprise and sympathy for none.",2017
3,"IMDB ratings suck. I don't want to waste time reviewing this, it was not worth the time even for a free ticket. The direction was poor and the lead actor was not a good match to play Tonya. Characters were totally caricatured and totally lacking depth and nuance. There is a scene towards the end, supposed to evoke some emotion from the audience, but it falls totally flat. None of the characters are likable or particularly relatable. Pity that such an interesting character was made it into a totally uninteresting movie.",2018
1,I'm sorry but I couldn't even watch this movie or pay attention to what was going on due the the excessive swearing ! ,2018
9,"I wasn't old enough to process Tonya Harding's story when it was going on, so I can only describe this movie as a fresh face. I loved how this movie played into the wild and varied accounts about Tonya's life. Instead of presenting one version and calling it ""the truth"" (which Harding even talks about through voice over in the final scene), they present different accounts through Harding (played by Margot Robbie), Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the movie is very ambiguous about what happened. This was refreshing, the story is just so bizarre no matter whose account you choose to believe. It allows the creative team the freedom to cherry-pick what they want to show, and I was constantly engaged. Normally I'm critical when the stray from the facts in a biopic but no one will ever ""actually"" know what happened, so the movie has some fun with it without straying into implausibility.",2018
7,"I remember well the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story (I was just graduating from high school when it all went down), and I was very intrigued to see how a movie would portray it all. At the time, I mostly just remember being done with the whole thing by the time it had played itself out. I was so sick of everybody involved, Kerrigan included, and it all just seemed so sleazy and embarrassingly American. The movie made me feel much the same way. These were trashy people living a trashy life style doing trashy things, and despite the film's clear intention to do so, it isn't able to wring much moral significance from the whole episode.",2018
2,"I hate when they try to make ""realistic"" bios, i.e. mock documentaries and/or ""interviews"" that are supposed to be real or feel real, but the actors still ""act"" and just aren't believable.",2017
7,"Can this be called a documentary? A mockumentary? Biopic? At different times throughout the film it felt like it wanted to be any one of all three of these. Still after ending credits rolled, the film didn't stick with me. It was good, and for a handful of scenes very good.
 However it was never great. ",2018
10,"Im Mexican and all i can say is Thanks you Pizax,I just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents, Mexico was represented beautifully,the music, the colors. This movie touched me in my soul and i cried a lot, i created an account just to say how good pixar made everything, again gracias pixar por tan hermosa pelicula.",2017
10,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.",2017
10,"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.",2017
10,"I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town. ",2017
10,"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.",2017
10,"A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.",2017

WOW, what an amazing movie, the story starts getting better and better, such a beautiful story, with so much touching moments, amazing soundtrack, congratulations to pixar, total respect to you guys, Mexico is amazing!!! you learn so much about the Mexican culture, incredible.",2017
10,"Well Disney and pixar really make such a great movies this year, kinda classic, but you know i love all the character, the color of the picture , and of course the story line , story twist. It was kind of tribute to Mexico culture. I think its a good movie, we learn about Mexican culture of death too in this movie. I think it suits for family, kiddo's will like it very much. well, so far every Disney animation never disappoint me ever, not this time too. Keep a good work Pixar!!",2017
10,"Pixar and Disney, managed to cover in the most masterful way the Mexican custom of the Day of the Dead, a cinematic experience that the world deserves to see to better understand one of the most famous Mexican traditions of this planet. This film is an offering to the Mexican people and a sort of reconciliation between Mexico and the United States.",2017
5,I did not watch this in 3D.,2017
5,"Leaving a review because I'm blown away at the amount of 9's and 10's I'm seeing for this movie, do you all have kids movies on a different scale? To me a movie is a movie and this was good for a kids movie but still incredibly formulaic with an obvious ending. I guess we'll have to see how much lower the score goes for this movie as at the time of this review its a 9/10, but its still just shocking to me to see it that high even though it's early. It truly is Pixar's 8th best movie at most and it's an alright idea but at the end of the day it's just a check all the boxes average movie. And that's okay; it's an alright kids movie but it doesn't deserve the praise people are showering it with.",2017
10,"Taking place in contemporary Mexico, in a fictional village named Santa Cecilia, ""Coco"" tells the story of a 12 year old musician, Miguel Rivera, whose family - ironically - hates music. There's a pretty good reason why they are against music though. Anyway, nothing can kill Miguel's dreams to meet the success of his icon, Ernesto de la Cruz. It all gets more complicated when he discovers that he is his ancestor and ""steals"" his magic guitar, which sends him to the World of the Dead. Throughout his journey there, he has the company of his adorable dog, Dante, and a trickster skeleton, Hector. That's how much I can reveal about the story.",2017
4,"Honestly, I wasn't amazed or fantacised by 'Coco'. It's nowhere even near the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALLE. It went on for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. The first half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't know why I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kinda entertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the film started to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'm glad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like they always do. The characters are good-fun and are people you can definitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck with these skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), it really is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoy Coco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like to watch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, and if you don't want to, don't. The first 40-50 minutes you may not be entertained or satisfied like I was, but you will be surprised and amazed and the second half. My overall review of the film is that it's not bad, watch it if you want to.",2017
5,"I really liked to love Coco a little more, however it's pretty obvious that Pixar as a creative flair for histories that feed the imagination of adults and children seems like it's not the same anymore. Coco has the story as any animated film. Young has talent, but prevented by the family from pursuing such a dream, the story is chiche and can be perceived from miles away and anyone can guess the unfolding of the story throughout the film. Stories were Pixar's strengths, they were simple for kids to understand, but interesting for adults to watch and have fun. In other words, the stories could serve both age groups. Coco has such a chiché and predictable history that it hardly needs other visualizations. Well, just seeing the movie once is more than enough. Still, the characters are interestingly written, I particularly like Hector, and the interactions with Miguel are excellent, Ernesto de la Cruz is the typical usurper of the animated films that has existed for decades. But still Pixar was professional enough to maintain interest in this drama between Ernesto de la Cruz and Hector, despite the chiche story between these two, it was well held the relations between them during the scenes of the film.",2017
5,"Kinda disappointed with this one. Coco could've been a cultural statement and a exploration of family values and death itself, but instead is a rather dull look at a celebration, not a tradition. The aesthetic qualities are there, as well as the overall depiction of current Mexican society (sort of), but everything else feels poor in comparison, vane even. The protagonist's journey lacks actual purpose, the writers seem more focused in the real adventure that in the metaphorical one. He doesn't grow or mature. And that is just one of the many issues this movie has. At the end, it's just another decent tearjerker children film.",2017
10,"Absolutely beautiful film. It touched my heart and soul like no other film ever has. Visually gorgeous. The acting was wonderful. That little boy, Miguel, was such a lovely, likable character. I wanted to reach on the screen and hug him. The songs? Wow, just amazing. Where there clichés? Sure, maybe but it didn't matter since the characters were original. The negative and so so reviews.....sorry but you have no heart. I don't think I can trust anyone who doesn't love this film. You are not human.",2017
7,"Despite the obvious following of the tear jerking formula, Pixar, makes you care every time. You can clearly see how they abuse same archetypes: family , children, dogs, death. Same plot twists of good guy turns out to be bad etc. You still totally lost in it and somehow care every time. Now they adopted ""disney singing"". you can see how they perfecting template of a weaponized tear jerking in a cartoon form. It is not nearly close to Wall-e or Up but as far away from Cars.",2017
2,"The animation for this movie was superb, but the story line was just too predictable and uninteresting. The whole realm of the dead made no logical sense, and basically the entire movie is about a boy and his dog (yawn) on a hero's quest (yawn) only to learn ___________(yawn). ",2017
9,"""Coco"" is unquestionably a movie about bridging gaps. In the film, a literal bridge of marigold petals links the Worlds of the Living and the Dead for a night. In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable ""The Book of Life"" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than ""Coco"", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as ""a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican"" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.",2017
1,"First of all, I have always been a huge fan of Pixar. I loved nearly all of their films, except for Cars 3 and Brave (I actually thought Cars 2 was fine - don't hate me!). I am usually very open to most films and give them positive ratings despite a few flaws.",2017

Thanks to all.",2017

8,"It's not a secret that every time Disney's Pixar make people of all ages spend their holiday or weekend with their families on the theaters to watch their latest product, the movie must be full of lovable characters, funny scenes, memorable soundtracks, and tear- jerking scenes that would push a critic website like Rotten Tomatoes to score it above 90% or so. Just take a look at Toy Story 3 (99%), Up (98%), Inside Out (98%), and Wall-e (96%). As for this year, we have Coco. As I write this review, Coco already gained a score of 96% on the aforementioned website. Well, it turns out that critics (almost) never wrong when it comes to scoring. Coco helps viewers to remember that no one ever truly dies as long as the memories about them, be it good or bad, live inside the hearts and minds of their loved ones, that the real and true death comes when the records of the dead simply vanished and no one is left to keep them safe and sound inside their neuron system, a cruel fate that everyone on the planet share sooner or later. As terrifying as it is, we are left with the choice of how we are going to be remembered before we fade away into nothingness, is it by doing something remarkable? something evil? something amazing? embarrassing? or just something mediocre? You decide..... ",2017
8,"The term 'fourth estate' was coined in 1841 by philosopher Thomas Carlyle when he said that the Reporter's Gallery was far more important than the 'three estates' of parliament. This titbit of history tells us the battle lines over 'fake news' are as old as 'the press' itself. It is also the context for The Post (2017), a dramatic thriller and civics lesson about the media's role in checking government power. The Post shows why the media is despised by despots and is thus essential viewing for anyone wanting to better understand today's shambolic attacks on the media. ",2018
10,"""The Post"" arrives to remind us about the indispensable role of the press in a democracy, ours in this particular case. An historical fact that comes to illustrate the dangerous times we're living now. The story of The Pentagon Papers is not ancient history and yet people seem to have forgotten. Americans in their 20's don't know about it as they didn't know about the House Of UnAmerican Activities. Education is at the center of our future so thank you Steven Spielberg for contributing to the awakening. In ""The Post"" the economy of the retelling is part of its brilliance. Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee is not Jason Robards but a Hanks, profoundly human, version of the man and Meryl Streep - Oh Meryl Streep ! - gives life to a woman who was not used to be the center of attention. A daughter a wife never in charge. Her dilemma is the sort of dilemma that, artists, teachers, parents, often confront. Her process to arrive to her decision is immensely moving and real. One of the miracles that Meryl Streep manages to perform again and again is that one forgets that it is her a second after she appears on the screen. I know this is a film I see again and show to youngsters at every possible opportunity. Thank you for that.",2017
9,"Economic, specific, brilliant. That should be enough to sing the praises of a work of art but in ""The Post"" there is more. much more. We can't ignore the fact imposed by the historical moment we're living right now. The press under attack. Belittled, insulted but not ignored. No, never that. Steven Spielberg puts everything at the service of the story and the magic stroke is Meryl Streep. She creates a real life woman again, after Margaret Thatcher, Julia Childs, Lindy Chamberlain and once again she creates a fully fledged human being and this time she plays a woman without a known voice until she finds it and when she does, she uses it. I'm absolutely transfixed and moved very moved by her performance",2017
4,"Incredible cast, right down to the small parts. But the film is heavy-handed to the point of ham-fisted, from the opening scene onwards. Mr Spielberg needed to have greater faith in his audience, and let the moments in the script breathe, rather than cutting to yet another brief shot of expository detail. The film is trying to be a kind of parable of feminist empowerment -- Katharine Graham finally comes into her own and she receives admiring and supportive glances from women all over! -- without realising that Katharine Graham was, from the start, smart and tough as hell. This could have been such a great film, if Spielberg had only trusted his writers, his audience, and his cast.",2018
7,"Spielberg's new drama about the controversial publication of the Pentagon Papers by the Washington Post and New York Times is a well-made and entertaining, albeit not perfect, film. Tom Hanks gives a thorough and enjoyable performance as Ben Bradlee, but it is Meryl Streep who truly stands out in the cast here through her role as Kay Graham. Bob Odenkirk's supporting role is also noteworthy in a very positive sense.",2017
6,"Much to my surprise, I found Spielberg's account of the Washington Post's constitutional battle with the Nixon Administration over the Post's audacious and impulsive decision to publish the leaked Pentagon Papers in 1971 to be mildly prosaic and detached. It definitely lacks the raw drama it was obviously angling for and key scenes came across as tentative and sloppy.",2017
2,"Yawwwwn.... so bad I almost fell asleep. It is a bit confusing to me since historically the NYT uncovered the story. They were prevented from publishing by Nixon's machine. So The Post wound up publishing it. Personally, I would have preferred for this film to be made of the story behind the NYT's story. That initial research, digging deep into the DC machine would have been as good as the Woodward/Bernstein story. Such a shame.",2018
4,"The difference is...the latter wasn't about anything but the men trying to get a story.
I find it ironic that when a film desperately wants to tell people that truth should be available to the public, it fabricates a lot of details to service what amounts to a dull story. While beautifully crafted, this film falls very flat, mostly because the agenda was to link Trump with Nixon. Since this has been done to death, very little is as amusing as watching social elitist scramble to dig dirt. One is left with why Katherine Graham's husband (former editor of the Washington Post) had committed suicide.
But that's not the story Spielberg wants to shove down your throat. It is about freedom of press. And forgive me for saying...newspapers don't have that power the internet has today. Before they had to fact check and wait to get the story correct. These days (and the WP is the worst offender) they get the story out FIRST. SO forgive the public for not pumping their fist in triumph at the end when the Supreme Court agrees with the 1st Amendment (yawn).
That is the problem with this film. Had it been made in Obama's 8 years, we might have braced ourselves for the future. Which...it's even more odd that we are able, each one of us Americans to share our opinion such as on IMDB or on our own blogs. When was this really an issue other than to lay defiburillator paddles on...printed press?!
Look, I'm always in awe of Spielberg's talent. This is a beautiful movie (as usual). It's crafted really well. But the earnestness of his message is similar to a child telling you about his butterfly collection that you know doesn't do jack for society. And it beats the drum over and over again. Strong strong performances, but this was such a letdown from the energy that I know will most likely be in ""Ready Player One.""",2018
7,"The latest Steven Spielberg film ""The Post"" is a nice showcase of the real life 1970's battle between government and journalist which would go to the highest court in the land(The U.S. Supreme Court). The film shows how information is uncovered and leaked about the highly criticized ""Vietnam War"".",2018
3,"I know that Hollywood had to produce a movie that would allow their top stars to get Oscar nominations. They will get their nominations but I doubt they will get any wins. I lived through this part of history and it seems odd that they did not cover what Nixon tried to do to the New York Times. This movie seems more concerned with how great the News Media is. If they were as great as they claim there would never have be a question about publishing the information they had. I watched the main star (Meryl Streep). She didn't seem to do anything that would warrant an Oscar nomination. It seemed as though any woman her age could have played the same part. It was the same way with Tom Hanks, there just wasn't anything special going on. Watch it and make up you own mind. try not to pay for it. Check your library or find a friend that already has a copy.",2018
4,"This 2-hour mess smacks of simple money-making sprinkled with preachiness. Even two big-name actors cannot save it from itself; Hanks' role is awkward, beneath him and his character, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. Streep? Well of course she gets to be Kay Graham, the Washington Post owner and socialite who tells us over and over that the weight of the decision to print stolen Pentagon papers fell to her. We get it! And Meryl gets to be Meryl . . . yipee! It was way more fun to hear her sing like Florence Foster Jenkins . . . ",2018
2,"Let's sum it up. Jack and Lyndon were tough, but Nixon, Well, he'll be out to get you! Essentially, this film is Hollywood's way of defending the main stream media that has been so damaged by its continual publishing of fake news. I agree, it's important to have a free press, but with freedom comes the responsibility to be accurate and transparent. Sooner or later, people are going to see through your agenda. Also, there was the whole women empowered thing.. Streep plays the widow of a Newspaper owner and at first she cannot stand up to the man, but finds her courage later in the movie. Whatever.. Didn't women get the right to vote over 100 years ago? Are we supposed to think men are responsible if they feel oppressed? Anyway, rant over. The movie is Hollywoods version of history and the timing is suspect given the fact that Trump is making news outlets look pretty dumb as of late.",2018
7,"Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks performances were lack-luster in this film... I'm not sure what all the hype was about. Meryl Streep especially had me yawning with her performance. And Spielberg didn't do much to impress me either. The pace felt really slow, some scenes lacking depth and others over-told. The only interesting part of this film was the story behind the film, that's it. 7/10 from me.",2018

10,"I was a kid during the Pentagon Papers and Watergate. I always looked up to Kay Graham as a woman of fortitude. This film has her restraining from being the woman I read about. However, I feel like this experience was the impetus of her awakening to her strength. I loved Streep's vulnerability and growth throughout the film. She is masterful in her ability to convey several emotions at the same time.
Ben Bradley played by Tom Hanks was so juicy. Loved his portrayal of this balls to the walls man of steel. Hanks truly shines. His speech about Jackie after the death of JFK touched me and brought a tear to the eye. 
Spielberg is just a Master of film. He can make you sit on the edge of your seat because he uses the camera to take you in the film. His style is so sophisticated. The actors are not just characters but the film is a character too. Spielberg is always moving the camera to set us in the story. 
Bonus is John Williams composed the music. The music is outstanding and is so compelling. Such a great Master of the art. Spielberg and Williams is always genius working together.
So if you don't see this on the big screen, you will regret it. We sat in a packed theatre today and you could hear a pin drop!
I knew the story when I walked in, likeI said I was kid at the time , but this picture made wish I paid more attention to politics when I was younger. 
If Spielberg makes a Watergate follow up movie with the same cast, it would be a HUGE hit. This is from a woman who can quote All the President's Men by heart. Please let it be... I would be first in line to see Spielberg's own take on Watergate!!",2018
2,"Very sub-par Speilberg. In an obvious attempt to bash Trump vis-a vis the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, this propaganda piece plays like 'The Lou Grant Show' meets 'Spotlight'. Hanks fails to bring any life to his character, and Streep plays the now trendy 'empowered'woman who owns the paper. Since most of America , except for millennials knows the story, there are no surprises here. While the film does make a case for freedom of the press, massive liberties and too many fictional characters sidetrack it to practically an afterthought. The film does manage to capture the look of the early 70s with period accurate cars and clothing, but maybe this distraction will not hide the fact that this is just an average movie that plays more like a made for TV film of the '70s. See it if you will,but don't expect too much. Amazing how Speilberg, the man who once made 'real'movies like 'Jaws', 'Close Encounters', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark',and *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'can slip into mediocrity with a film likie this. A money grab and Oscar bait rolled into one.",2018
3,Serioiusly i really wanted to like this movie just dont know what to say .bits and pieces of Hanks of old but hard to see much to be positive about .Maybe I missed it but surely time for retirement Mr Spielberg.,2018
1,"I am not sure, maybe it was because I was tired, but this movie was tragically slow paced. Fell asleep a few times, did not finish it because I was awoken by a worker, who told me that I was snoring. I apologized and left.",2018
9,"Which is why this movie is so controversial almost fifty years after the fact, and why you see so many reviews express hostility to the real life ""Washington Post"" rather than addressing the merits of the story, the acting, the message, etc. My wife and I lived through the Nixon years in Washington, and the story so well told here is of determined and fearless professionals unafraid to challenge assaults on our liberties. As with ""Spotlight,"" who knew you could milk so much drama out of folks typing madly away or pawing through stacks of paper? Or that the mighty vibration of a huge printing press starting up could be so moving? Despite nits, this story rings true on so many levels, emotional, dramatic, personal, historical, and I can think of lots worse ways for modern audiences to get an advanced education on the role of a Free press in a democracy.",2018
5,"A cover-up that spanned four U.S. Presidents pushed the country's first female newspaper publisher and a hard-driving editor to join an unprecedented battle between journalist and government. The Post was a film that i was excited about since it's been directed from a director that i love and respect Mr. Steven Spielberg and has a talented cast of names like Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Bradley Whitford and Bruce Greenwood unfortunately the film is lifeless and hollow i mean the first 9 minutes i felt like i was watching a different movie and at times Hanks character was kind of a d*ck i mean he even gives a middle finger to one of his 'friends' which was awkward. The film is also kinda boring and at times it tries to sell this whole feminist thing with Streep's character and i rolled my eyes so hard. The movie means well and i'm sure of that but the way it tells those events it feels like it's missing a spark or a better script in general (i mean look at how great Spotlight was a film that had a similar structure and look how bland The Post is in comparison). The acting is good from the 2 main leads but the rest of the cast is either running fast to send copies or to print the story for the paper or others are d*cks to Streep's character especially Whitford's character that is kind of a sexist (because that's how movies work this days with it's political agendas). Overall 'The Post' had some good things like Hanks and Streep but also a bland script, forgettable characters and even Spielberg's direction is a mess he goes from scene to scene without even explaining things or adapting them better which was disappointing for a director of his kind.",2018

Must watch !",2017
10,"Every episode will make you want to see more. Amazing mind blowing masterpiece. Is like a mix between Death Note with a Heist. I don't know what is wrong with the people hating it or saying that the reviews are fake or paid. If you hate this is probably because you don't like hearing spanish actors (or you are a racist). Spanish is my first language so this was natural to me, I was concentrated on the amazing actors and story (and i don't normally watch Spanish TV shows). Give it a try you won't regret it.",2018

9,"I must say la casa de papel is an original series with great mind game ideas that will keep you hooked in all the episodes the ideas of the robbery plan are original and fresh.in my opinion it will be better if the producers worked more on the guns aspect, in some scenes we see robbers or police shooting from guns more then 200+ bullets without even reloading which clearly make no sense even for non guns experts. other then that it's a great series.",2018
10,"Do yourself a favor and watch this series. Mindblowing, speechless, amazing.",2018
5,"The plot gives us so many promises that it can not keep. Still better than average. However, cliché characters make it hard to watch wirhout feeling ashamed for the script writer. Some characters are well-built, but mostly stereotypical. It is supposed to be a smart robbery with smart thieves however i cant stop wondering why the proffesor picked those people specifically. Tokyo, for example, what is she really good for except supposed-to-be-sexy cliché monologues to intimidate certain someone or just wandering around, turning people on, making it all harder for the others.
There are many flaws as such.
But still watching it for the fun of it since it is hard to find clever scripts anymore.
The show is thrilling enough to let myself be fooled on certain details.",2018

5,"This is one of the most overrated show i have ever seen, the downhill is so hard that it hurt me psychologically.
The romance is bad and stupid with no sense plot. 
The characters in the beginning seem to be very pro and you can find later that they are a bunch of amateurs, they will make you hate the characters instead of develop them, the insteresting ones...well... you will see
the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think ""damn nice..."" the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails.
its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show.",2018

5,"Greetings again from the darkness. Allowing three regular guys to play themselves in the cinematic re-telling of their courageous and heroic actions is a fitting tribute to the men, and it's an approach that we must be willing to cut some slack. On August 21, 2015, a terrorist aboard the Thalys train bound for Paris was thwarted in his attempt to carry out his mission of evil. Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler ultimately subdued the terrorist (who won't be named here), likely saving many lives.",2018
7,"While it doesn't come close to Clint Eastwood's best films, I still definitely enjoyed this story of life and bravery., but some will find the film too slow and just waiting for the thwarted terrorist attack. We all know the story, 3 Americans stop an attempted terrorist attack aboard a train to Paris, but the film is almost barely about that, its more of story about their lives and what led them to their destiny. I only really sort of didn't like the acting, which I will discuss later, but for the most part I had no issues with this film, which is not over-patriotic flag waving propaganda like many anti-military Liberals will say it is. Its a story about the lives of men as well as when bravery is forced upon average citizens.",2018
5,"The 15:17 to Paris is Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort. It's also my latest review. In truth, I liked the pic's title. As for ""Paris"" itself, well it's meh when it could have been so much greater. I need more exuberance with stuff that possesses historical insight. ",2018
3,"Going into this I didn't have high expectations. If you haven't heard, the ""stars"" of the film aren't actors. They are the guys who actually lived the story. I knew this going into the film, and I was still shocked at how jarring an experience it was to watch regular guys act on the big screen. Don't get me wrong, I certainly couldn't do any better. Not to mention, I haven't done anything in my life anyone should make a movie about. ",2018
1,"Ninety percent of this film was set in the 3 main characters backgrounds. From meeting in primary school through to entry into the defence forces. The other 10 percent was the actual terror attack, which lasted less than a minute. Of the 3 ""heroes"" only one was portrayed as a true action taker. The other 2 hid under the seats only to get involved after the terrorist was disarmed and taken down. ",2018
2,"So this is a movie about the 15:17 to Paris?! Well, a few minutes of the movie are actually spent in the train but the rest is a bunch of scenes patched together that it makes me wonder that the movie has been approved by a studio. ",2018
7,"Eastwood is never trivial or corny. This could have been an american flag waving hero film (some people see it that way anyway) but in fact it's about a normal guy that has been treated not so well in life by the authorities but at the end has his day and becomes what he always wanted to be: someone that saves lives. It's about life. Not flags. For example, it's interesting when the guys are corrected by the german tourist operator saying that Hitler was under attack by the Russians and NOT the Americans when he killed himself. You can't always be the hero when evil is defeated. I don't see flag waving here.",2018
3,"To begin with, the three men who performed this act of courage deserve all the praise and honor they have received. They stood brave in the face of evil and terrorism and managed to prevent disaster.",2018
1,"After American Sniper- a true story about a man who is known only for the amount of people he killed on the battleground- one could be forgiven for thinking that Mr. Eastwood had gotten his jingoistic kink out of his system. This proves to be far from the case, and it would also seem that in a short amount of time he has lost all ability to make a remotely entertaining, cohesive, even interesting film after 2016's extremely solid Sully.",2018
3,"Firstly, my take is not meant to diminish the heroism these guys displayed on the day of the attack at all. They went above and beyond at great personal peril, and should be commended. Having said that... they can't act a lick! The worse part is, the guy who is the worse actor has the biggest role. Watching him act was like watching a grade school production of hamlet, if that schools production entire main cast was out with the flu and it was put on by the much less talented booger nose eating stand-ins. However, it wasn't just the bad acting (although that was a big part), the movie itself meandered with scenes which I'm still trying to find any possible meaning behind, except for helping to fill the time. I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, but his skills at directing and storytelling were not enough to save this turkey of a movie.",2018
9,"« mostly comprised of banal, drama-free, quotidian scenes that merely reinforce the men's status as regular Joes who, one day, had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon »",2018
5,"The 15:17 to Paris is a story about 3 friends, 2 of which who have been in the US army, defend a train from a terrorist and save the lives of all onboard. While this is a thrilling story, the movie turns into something much more bland and uneventful. The first 30 minutes were good, showing background into the characters' lives, but as it went on, it slowed to a near halt. The boys drifted slowly apart and the story becomes more about Spencer Stone than anything else. About halfway through the film, the boys backpack through Europe. with Spencer and Anthony exploring Italy while Alek goes off to see Germany. The film then digresses into just watching people be tourists, going from place to place without doing much of anything. Understandably, this is do the the fact that it is the true story of what they did, which is the appeal for the movie, however it needed more suspense or plot to keep it moving. As for the acting, the main characters were shaky, understandable since they are not actors, however the writing is very staged and bland. Much of the writing is very direct talk to convey the plot, and seems too scripted for way the film is set up. If the main characters were actors, I'm sure it would have come across as more natural, but the combination of bad screenplay and amateur acting lead to a seemingly staged plot for a ""real event"". Overall, 5/10, not terrible, its for the most part enjoyable, and a decent time waister for anyone who loves movies against terrorism.",2018
1,"I have no idea how this got approved. It's over an hour of boring outtakes from a found-footage movie, with something interesting only at the end.",2018
4,Judging by the rather unusual score distribution so far:,2018
1,I realized about halfway through this movie that nothing was happening; I was just watching a documentary home movie of 3 kids growing up in America and it was not very interesting. There was no dramatic action until the last 10 minutes; no suspense or background of the terrorist leading to train trip. Characters were on a Europe vacation through 25% of the movie with no action. It was just a boring movie. We came home and watched Waco and Strike Back at home and TV was much better than this dull movie. Clint Eastwood's worst film to date...,2018
4,"Having seen and enjoyed Sully and knowing the extent of director Clint Eastwood's ability, I was very disappointed with this movie.",2018
9,"For those who criticize the non action parts of the movie miss the point. This movie is about ordinary people who had to deal with an extraordinary situation. The events only took minutes so of course it isn't a non stop action movie. It was a good thing to use the actual people as much as possible the three from Sacramento and the other from Virginia played themselves. It didn't have a reality TV feel - it actually helped make things much more real - not just some famous actors in perilous situations and there is nothing wrong with their acting. The parts showing the training of Stone were useful for the way he tackled the terrorist later and helped the shooting victim so it wasn't wasted. I actually enjoyed their trip through Rome, Venice, Berlin and Amsterdam. Their dialog was so much like any person who has done the Eurailpass thing would recognize. Showing their happy times helps emphasize the beauty and good times that still exist in Europe ",2018

It follows the three American friends Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos after having different paths with their lives. One going into survival training in the military, the other being in the army in Afghanistan, and the third just being at there home state. They decide to go backpacking touring the European countries from Italy to Germany. Then, the final tour going to Paris. They decide to take the train to the country.

1,"Clint Eastwood's effort to pay tribute to these incredible heroes did not succeed. The script was terrible, the three main guys (the real heroes) cannot act one iota, and the film was filled with lots of empty meaningless space. The last 10 minutes were the best thing about the movie. That's when the heroes came alive and made an impact. I don't want to disparage these guys in any way, but this movie was just awful. If this is the kind of thing that Clint is doing is his advanced years, he needs to retire.",2018

Can we expect more from Mr Eastwood who has all the power and control and a reputation that says, ""I am in control, leave me alone!"" He hired non-actors to be featured in a major motion picture. Yes, Captain Phillips did the same, but not with the lead actors. When you hire Tom Hanks to handle the brunt of the load, you can use fill-ins who can do a great job, but is this the same here? Does it reflect a realism? Can non-actors really make a movie like this work in a Reality TV culture? Only the viewer can answer these questions. If this film is successful (it will not generate the steam as American Sniper) but if people like it it will reflect this American culture of divide. I predict half will love it and half will hate it. Welcome to the American political system. Time will tell...",2018

It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that.",2017
10,"I cried my eyes out. It was cleansing and reinvigorating. Timothee Chalamet is the living image of a friend from my childhood. He had a similar experience but a very different outcome and it made me think with a broken heart that if my friend had had a father like Elio's father he could have had a real chance at a happy, constructive life, instead of the agonizing pain that he went through. I hadn't though about him for years and Timothee brought him back to me with enormous power. What a beautiful, beautiful performance. Armie Hammer is a total revelation, the perfect foil for a first love. Michael Stuhlbarg introduces us to a character I had never seen on the screen before. He moved me no end, Then, of course, Luca Guadagnino. My hat to you sir. This is a film I will see many times.",2017

In contrast, in Luca Guadagnino's (""A Bigger Splash"") achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17-year-old Elio's (Timothée Chalamet, ""Love the Coopers"") life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by three-time Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, ""Free Fire"") is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Steve Jobs"") at Perlman's gorgeous villa in Northern Italy.",2017
5,"I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams.",2017
10,"It is not often that films adapted from books capture the true essence, emotion and spirit of the book but for me Call Me By Your Name does just that. Superbly acted by a talented cast the film was a visual an emotional delight. Sensitively directed and beautifully shot with a great sound track what was not to like. For me it was a coming of age love story for Elio and something very special for Oliver. Simply calling it a gay movie does it a disservice. It is much, much more than that. While the whole cast were strong the two leads, Armie, and Timothee just had that magic on screen. And Timothee Chalamet's performance was stunning absolutely stunning. His closing scene will become a cinema classic. Don't be put off by the gay tag this is a beautiful love story, sensitively told that surly anybody can empathise with. Don't miss it.",2017

Someone was paid to write them maybe? or the crew organised a ratings campaign. This movie was above all, slow and boring. I quickly lost all interest in any of the characters. One pointless scene after another. At the time Elio had sex with the peach, I googled the length of the movie and realised there was another 30 minutes of this 132 minutes of tripe to suffer through. I couldn't face it and four of us walked out. Oh and unless it was in the last 30 minutes, the morality of a much older man fooling around with the 17 year son while staying in the house of his colleague was not addressed? Was this romanticising casual sex with children? Kind of creepy. Not a patch on Brokeback Mountain. Far more interesting, way more depth and nuance, far better acting.",2017

It's been said before but, without spoilers, the end credits are so overwhelming and emotional. If Timothée Chalamet doesn't win an Oscar for his role as Elio then people will be extremely upset for him, myself included. His work here is undoubtedly the most realistic and truthful performance I have ever seen in my life. Oliver, played flawlessly by Armie Hammer, becomes a counterpart of Elio and it is striking to see the two become so close. This movie does take its time, but it is so natural that it doesn't affect the film's impact whatsoever. Elio and Oliver's chemistry feels so palpable and unscripted. Often in romantic films the script is written so that the characters act or speak in a way that directly and forcibly pulls the heartstrings. With Call Me By Your Name, however, it's as if you are watching a beautiful and giddy relationship unfold in front of your eyes. Every emotion felt by Elio is felt by the audience. The last third will completely drain you of emotion, particularly one scene with Michael Stuhlbarg. Along with the emotion felt while viewing the film, it also manifests your thoughts afterwards and hits you harder and harder as time goes on. Rush to see this as soon as you can; it is not only the best movie this year, but one of the best movies ever made and a timeless classic.",2017
3,"Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name is the third in a trilogy which includes A Bigger Splash, a decent potboiler of sorts also set in Italy and starring English speaking actors. The film is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by André Aciman. James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) wrote the screenplay.",2017
1,I found this film rather emotionally unengaging. I was very aware that the characters were acting and that I was being manipulated. This film felt smug and self-congratulatory. I thought Armie Hammer was too old for the part. I didn't like the way in which the girlfriends were reduced to bit parts and foils with no real existence of their own. Ditto the housekeeper.,2017
10,"""Call Me by Your Name"" is an hypnotically beautiful coming of age drama that surpasses the cliché of the 'queer film' as overwrought naval-gazing depression fantasy full of sleazy sex, instead celebrating the intoxicating passion of youthful love with tender sensuality. Set in 1983, it details the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager named Elio, who is besotted with the arrival of a handsome older student, Oliver, who comes to stay at his family's pastoral Italian villa for the summer.",2017
7,"Being a hardcore Blade Runner and science fiction fanatic, I felt deeply compelled to write this review. I love Ridley Scott's original 1982 Sci-Fi classic. It is my all-time favorite movie. It had mystique and infused my imagination. It was a unique experience; hypnotic & surreal. The sequel, not so much! ",2017
3,"""Blade Runner 2049"" comes off incredibly long and boring. Not because of the slow pacing – ""Blade Runner"" had slow pacing too, but had the viewer hypnotized – but because there's no interesting thoughts present and nothing new really. Thematically the movie is exploring the same questions (about being human etc.) as the first movie did 35 years ago. And the few 'new' additions to the Blade Runner universe are totally devoid of originality. Take for instance K's hologram-wife. Not only are those scenes totally unnecessary (that three-way scene, jeez!), but we've seen the concept so many times before (for instance in Spike Jonze's ""Her""). ",2017
9,"So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.",2017
6,"What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother.",2017
3,Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for you,2017
3,Blade Runner is one of my favorite films of all time for a number of reasons: ,2017
1,"I didn't realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!",2017
3,"I broke a taboo and went to see the Film Which Shouldn't Have Been Made, aka Blade Runner 2049. And regretted it.",2017
2,"SPOILERS ALERT: The biggest difference between 1982 masterpiece and this one is that in the first film everything is happening at a normal speed. In original movie people talk like they talk in real life, their move at perfectly normal, every day, common speed, it doesn't take them forever to finish the sentence, or to shape out a thought, and yet... somehow it all works perfectly together.",2017
5,Please be aware that my review contains spoilers so please do not read further if you do want to have key plot points revealed.,2017
1,"BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big ""plot twist"" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.",2017
1,"I always gave the original Blade Runner 10/10. Seen it a over a 1000 times including at the movie theater. Good pace, visuals, music, likable characters, bad guys. Yup, pretty much everything. One of my top 10 movies of all time. This review for 2049 is not because it should be the same thing or make it over the top.",2017
10,"For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. ",2017
3,The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is a masterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and for the time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.,2017
1,"The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in the company of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinema feeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonous film. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just going from place to place to investigate something like in a video game. At the beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basically indestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out any suspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable, the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it had atmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot of emptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solid light fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from a small device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why are they so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production when they are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped with holographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TV quality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technology jump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the most important parts of the original. He conveyed through the use of synthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder, beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson was originally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of done a great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywood sounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. It might as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loud noise. The original was a box office failure that became a cult classic. This is just a failure.",2017
10,"Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!",2017
1,"In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. ",2017
3,"In 1982 I was deeply excited about the prospect of seeing ""Blade Runner,"" and can remember applying for a chance to see an advance showing in Sacramento. From the start it seemed obvious that it was a special film--clouded in controversy and mystery. Later I acquired my much-viewed VHS copy, with all the eye-gouging, nail-puncturing violence. Later still the Internet provided background information as, eventually, did articles plus a comprehensive book by Paul M. Sammon. In short, I am a fan, and was eagerly anticipating the sequel.",2017
5,"Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like ""good guy kills bad guy at the end"" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.",2017
4,The answer? Don't Do It In The First Place!,2017
10,"At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.",2017
8,"It's a one man show about one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and what a show it is. Gary Oldman has been able to be Sid Vicious in ""Sid And Nancy"" with the same outstanding commitment and extraordinary results. Joe Wright, the gifted director of ""Atonement"" presents us with an irresistible version of Churchill through the magic powers of Oldman but sometimes he doesn't seem to trust the power of what he has in his hand. Eccentric cuts in the middle of a famous speech for instance and other stylistic distractions arrive with irritating frequency but that doesn't spoil. too much, the joy and fun of seeing Gary Olman in action. Also interesting to notice, Dunkirk provides a very moving moment for the second time this year.",2017
10,"I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere..",2017
8,I'm sure I am not alone in having seen everything ever filmed about the man.,2017
9,"At just under 1000 votes so far, I am stunned at the number of ""1"" votes. On the other hand, the 2nd-highest number of votes is for ""10"", so there is very much a love-it-or-hate-it quality to the voters.",2017
10,This film is absolutely brilliant from the acting to the sets..the editing is tight. Thrilling. It took me about 1 minute to accept Gary Oldham as Churchill...after that I was sold.,2017
9,"Not only is this a riveting account of one of the most important moments of the Second World War, but it's also an exhilarating drama that goes beyond being a simple biography by bringing humour, energy and passion to every moment. With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.",2017
9,"Garry Oldman first came to my notice as Sid. He now steps into Albert Finney's gigantic shoes, and does not disappoint. But a note of disapproval- it was not the Labour Party which brought down Chamberlain in 1940, it was Leo Amery, single handed, with the greatest, most passionate Cri de Coeur ever heard in a parliament until the Man himself unleashed the 18"" guns of the English Language.",2017
9,"At the Paris Theater premiere in NYC last night, Joe Wright concluded his introduction by saying, ""This is a film about resistance."" That brought immediate and enthusiastic response from the crowd. Oldman gives a stunning performance, but the entire ensemble is clearly caught up in the relevance of the work, not a false note anywhere. Powerful film celebrating Churchill as in touch with the resilience and grit of working class commoners. The villains here are the snobbish pacifist appeasers. Hard to say what American audiences will make of this. It could go either way. There's enough populist ammunition here to leave a huge chunk of the American political landscape as devastated as the castle in Calais.",2017
8,"It is impressive how The World War II can still produce great films after almost eighty year. ""Darkest Hour"" is an example, showing the biography of Winston Churchill in 1940 when Hitler was invading and dominating the Western Europe. But the film works mainly because of the fantastic performance of Gary Oldman. It is amazing how this actor incorporates the image we have of the great British leader in archival footages. Gary Oldman really deserves the Oscar! Kristin Scott Thomas is also impressive in the role of Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie. My vote is eight.",2018
6,"We go to the movies to be gripped by powerful narratives presented with good scripts and moving imagery. This film has all of it, most especially a riveting performance by Gary Oldman. ",2017
10,This was Gary Oldman'e finest hour. To play Winston Churchill was probably the most difficult role any actor had to endure. Since the early years of war films there were hardly any references as to who Churchill really was. Most times it was by way of radio broadcasts that the people heard him speak against Hitler and his regime from trying to conquer Britian during WWII. How sad it was that the war commission wanted to negotiate peace rather than to fight against tyranny.,2017
9,"THE DARKEST HOUR: France has fallen, the Nazi invasion of Britain is eminent, the bulk of the British forces is stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk with no way out, current PM, Chamberlain, is considered too weak to lead and rather than entering a war members of Parliament feel they cannot win, they vote to negotiate a peace settlement with Germany, with Italy acting as a mediator. After Chamberlain's ouster, Winston Churchill is appointed the new PM, and backed by the voice of the people, vows to never surrender. He firmly believes negotiation equals capitulation. I don't know how historically accurate the rest of the movie is (except for some of his speeches, I imagine), or if some of the conversations depicted ever took place, but they reveal a stunning picture of the temperament, power, character, oratory skill and will of Churchill to never accept defeat. Gary Oldman, as Churchill, brings all of that and more to his riveting portrayal - the voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the tilt of his head. His months of research and preparation have paid off. Oldman just may be the greatest, and most under appreciated actor of his generation. (The male equivalent of Streep, to my mind.) This is his movie and any superlative you can think of applies to his performance. There is no question as to his Oscar nomination for best actor, just as there is no question of Joe Wright's nom for direction. Wright has chosen some unusual, innovative and interesting camera placements - in particular, the shot of James as she types, taken from underneath the typewriter shooting through the keyboard up to her face. I mean how creative is that? Wright maintains the tension and immediacy of the situation, yet manages to throw in some moments of tenderness and humor - a really masterful job. Also no question as to the noms for best picture, the brilliant screenplay, cinematography, costume and makeup design. I would pay to see the process of transforming Oldman into Churchill. Kristin Scott Thomas has been getting the accolades for her performance as Churchill's wife, Clementine, but the real supporting nom should go to Lily James' beautifully sublime performance, as Winston's secretary. Score: 9.5. GO!",2018
4,"This film covers a period of real tension and drama. So why does the film have to invent fiction to tell the story? Perhaps modern film making prioritizes a flowing narrative over the truth, but to misrepresent so many people telling the story accurately would have provided more than sufficient content staggers me.
Oldman plays his part as written well. Chamberlain and Halifax are quite unconvincing though and many of the scenes are so unrepresentative of what would have happened in the Britain of 1940 ruins the fictitious plot line. 
The number of historical inaccuracies are currently beyond counting, and many unecessary, for example Chamberlain was in pain in May 1940, but had yet to be diagnosed with cancer, and when he was he remained ignorant of the fact because his doctors elected not to tell him. Overall a huge let down.",2018
4,"I had high hopes for this Winston Churchill biopic directed by Joe Wright, but it unfortunately fell well short of my expectations. It is simply an utter shame that while this is very far from the worst film of the year, it's undoubtedly the most disappointing one.",2017
6,"Oscar season brings out the good stuff, but this 2+ hour soliloquy, by arguably one of the most momentous figures in the 20th Century, will leave even ardent history buffs gasping for one action scene, one cutaway from makeup, cigars, and prosthetics, no matter how effectively applied. This movie will serve a niche audience, a very special type of moviegoer who already knows and loves Winston Churchill; in fact, those relatively new to Churchill might come away thinking him a mumbling drinker, a joke cracking W.C. Fields, unsure of his place in the English government and timid regarding his approaching role in world history. ",2018
10,"Incredible screenplay, visionary directing, outrageous acting, and riveting sound!",2017
9,"Gary Oldman has 88 acting credits on his IMDB page. Incredibly, this fine actor has only been nominated for an Oscar 1x - as Lead Actor in 2012's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY. He did not win.",2017
7,"That Gary Oldman is one the greatest living actors in the planet is a known fact to all cine-buffs around the world, but with 'Darkest Hour', Oldman has put himself in a place of the all-time heavyweights in Acting. As Winston Churchill, Oldman is a veritable delight & shows us what an actor can do when he sinks his teeth into the part. Oldman is PURE, unfiltered Acting Greatness. And Yes, the movie is good too!",2017
3,I was SO READY to LOVE this movie! Churchill? Love him. Oldman? Love him. James? Love her. Each gets one star.,2018
1,This movie provides no information about Winston Churchill that isn't already in the high school curriculum and it provides no new insight into the man given what the public generally knows about him.,2017
4,"Historical drama in modern day Hollywood is in a dead end that seems endless at this moment. There are just not some decent scripts left, even if they are depicting some of the most fascinating characters and events of our civilization.
Yes, not even the rise of Winston Churchill can give us a non-sweetened and real story without much distortion of historical facts. No, ''Darkest hour'' can even grant us with some decent acting, and if Gary Oldman receives the ''Golden boy'' for his somewhat caricaturel portrayal of the greatest British politician of this century, it will represent a injustice, both to his impeccable career and his opponents in ''Kodak theater''. 
On the other hand, not everything will be dark in ''Darkest hour'', since Joe Wright will give us some really great focusing, light and overhead cuts, making it deservedly to all the major directing nominations.
''Darkest hour'' will represent the feast for the eye, but your brain will be pretty much annoyed during the entire course of the movie.",2018
1,"In Darkest Hour, Gary Oldman shines as Winston Churchill. But history takes a hit.
Darkest Hour, like many historical films, invents some of its story - but in this case, it's a problem
That Underground scene, as it turns out, is both heartwarming and totally fabricated. Watching it, it's hard not to feel your heart swell with courage. Yes! We must stand against the fascists, and it's the ordinary people who must hold their leaders accountable. There's no more 2017-appropriate inspirational theme than that.
And yet that encounter on the carriage never happened. Does that mean Darkest Hour is spreading misinformation? Not exactly. Churchill did go on to stand his ground, and we know how that decision played out. That the Underground scene (and some others like it, which historians will surely spot) was imagined in order to make the story work on screen doesn't change what happened in history.
But it still made me feel a little queasy. Throughout the film, Churchill and a few others struggle with whether it's okay to fudge the truth in order to bolster
Churchill might have become a man we remember a little differently. If you look past his witticisms and the war effort, you're left with a man with deeply troubling views-who might not be the hero we imagine.
That's the same question Their Finest approaches - and both films ultimately skirt the issue. But Darkest Hour goes one step further and embraces what it explores, becoming a movie that fiddles with the truth.",2017
9,"A very welcome New Year Treat with a cracking script, crisp direction and an engaging cast. Usually, portraits of Winston Churchill tend to be focused on a fully empowered man, complete with legendary wit, oratory and fighting spirit. What makes Gary Oldman's Churchill stand out is his nuance of character, exploring the doubts and frailties of a man at the centre of political intrigue and the weight of impending history. The dialogue is riveting as you are drawn into a very complex dance of war or peace. The events leading up to Dunkirk are explained clearly with the resulting urgency to evacuate bringing a tension to the story total lacking from last summer's, ""Dunkirk"". Kudos to an outstanding cast, particularly Ben Mendohlson's King George VI.",2018
10,"When you have a reviewer complain about Churchill 'polluting' the room with his cigars, you know you are in troll territory. But seriously, what a performance. What a movie. Historically accurate, well-paced - no make it 'perfectly paced' and terrific script.",2018

9,I absolutely fell in love with the story of this movie. I went to the premier last night and didn't really know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. I don't consider myself an emotional movie watcher but I almost lost it 3 times and I laughed more than I could remember. The story line was very easy to follow along. I did not lose interest not one time. I was so impressed with the children actors. A very beautifully written and directed movie. Must watch for the whole family.,2017
9,"First of all, I gotta say that I read the book. I absolutely loved the book. Now, I wasn't going to raise my expectations for the movie adaptation because we all know how movies disappoint in comparison to the book. Wonder however, stays true to the book, which is its major redeeming point. I thought it would be some modified, really boring movie that would make me sigh throughout the whole 2 hours as I pointed out key flaws and differences between the movie and book (because I'm one of those people), but I loved it. The acting was INCREDIBLE, the story stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot points rather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience. When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said they had cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only person who felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall there wasn't one bad actor. IF you were considering seeing this movie but weren't sure because you thought it might be boring, trust me, it's really worth the watch!!",2017

10,"13 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Wonder. Today is world kindness day and a link appeared on Facebook offering free tickets at cinemas across the country to see a special pre-release preview of this beautiful film. Wonder is the story of Auggie Pullman who is born different. Home schooled, his mother feels it's time for him to enter mainstream education and he joins the 5th grade. People can be cruel and kids can be cruellest of all and Auggie struggles in a world where everyone stares and whispers and even bullies. It's not only Auggie who struggles however, as the film progresses we are told the story from different angles, that of Auggie himself, his sister, his sister's friend and his own new friend. All have issues which are both affected and unaffected by the way Auggie looks. This is a heartwarming tale, based on a New York Times bestselling book. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play the parents who love their son fiercely and ache for his anguish and rejoice in his successes as he finds his way in the world of the 5th grade. I urge you to go and see this, easy to watch and the characters are all endearing in their own way, even the bullies. I believe it's on general release at the beginning of December.",2017
10,"After reading some of the reviews for this movie, I am ashamed at how vapid, and un-empathetic the human race can be. Unfortunately, people have very narrow minds. The message to the movie is great. This is motivational to give you the strength to say, if he can do it, then what do I have to complain about, and hopefully that message is enough. However, after reading some of the negative reviews I can see that people are miserable and their narrow minds do not allow them to see the bigger picture. People do not understand that in order for people to actually learn to accept people who are different, then society and the media have to paint a picture depicting how easy it can be. The same thing can be said for gay people. Without the media painting the picture that it is ok to be gay, and accept gay people, I feel like it wouldn't happen quite as easily as it is nowadays. This movie shows kids that there are people out there who have deformities, or differences, and it is ok to accept them, because they too are people and can be loved. Shame on the people who have reviewed the movie and were not able to realize this concept even if they were bullied and find it unrealistic. Times have changed. And for those who have no tact, well this review isn't going to help you learn tact or be a better person, therefore not for you. Sadly, the people writing the negative reviews will have, or do have children, thus perpetuate the cycle until one day they or someone they know and love turns out to be different.",2018
9,"Simply put, this is the perfect family film for all ages. Outstanding acting by little Canadian phenom Jacob Tremblay as well as a great supporting cast. Very well written and directed. A must see film. 9/10 from me",2018
9,"Have you ever felt like you were the same as everybody else, but you were also different from the world? 10-year-old Auggie Pullman will tell you that while he feels extraordinary on the inside, outside, he doesn't feel like that. He feels lonely, invisible to everyone around him. I guess, maybe we all feel like that sometimes. Maybe we're outsiders trying to leave a mark on the world, just like Auggie. Which is why ""Wonder"" appeals to the underdogs in all of us. This beautiful book, which came from the riveting and honest imagination of author R.J. Palacio, has touched the lives of millions of readers of all ages (I'm one of those readers). Now, with the help of co-writer/director Stephen Chbosky (Author/screenwriter/director of one of my favorite tales, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", Co-writer of Disney's astonishing live-action remake of ""Beauty and the Beast""), I can't imagine anyone, kid or adult, ever being disappointed with this endearing adaptation of a beloved book that has great messages of never judging a person by their looks and to always choose kind, which is something that we all need to learn from in this day and age. With convincing prosthetics and makeup that makes look nearly unrecognizable, the wondrous Jacob Tremblay from ""Room"" and ""The Book of Henry"" is brilliant as Auggie. He has Treacher-Collins Syndrome (a craniofacial disorder) and has survived 27 surgeries. After being home-schooled for half his life by his mom, Isabel (Julia Roberts. still luminous and radiant as ever), he is sent to public school for the first time, with a little help from her, his dad, Nate (Owen Wilson) and his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), who has always been there for him. As soon as he goes to school, he immediately gets picked on and bullied because of his appearance. Some kids, including Jack Will (Noah Jupe) and Summer (Millie Davis) accepts him for who he is. Even some of the staff, including English teacher, Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs from ""Hamilton"") and the principal, Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin) cares for him. But some, including bully Julian (Bryce Gheisar), don't like him. As the story progresses, we get to see the different perspectives of each of the characters, family and friends, who will leave an impact in Auggie's life in moments that are good and bad. Only then, Auggie will unlock the power of acceptance and friendship in order for him to truly find his place in the world. ""Wonder"" is a tough-minded film that reminded so much of how I used to love the classic family films I grew up with. A movie that doesn't dwell on special effects, talking animals or a big budget, but has deeper thoughts and real themes that enthralls the inner kid in all of us. It's moving, funny and tenderhearted in an authentic way that shows us that we have to see through the eyes and soul of another person, rather than seeing what that person looks like. It also helps by having a great writer/director and a terrific, well-chosen cast (including poignant turns from Danielle Rose Russell and Nadji Jeter, who plays Via's friend and first love, respectfully and a brief cameo from Sonia Braga as the Pullmans' grandmother) who care for this story that it never goes over the top with the emotions and it never goes down a conventional, melodramatic and saccharine path. Every moment of emotion fits like a puzzle and convincingly flows in every scene. Auggie said, ""We all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives."" I say, we should all give a standing ovation to both book and movie of ""Wonder"", because like its characters that gets their moments of pure humanity and, of course, dear little Auggie, this story is a wonder.

6,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise and crowd-pleasing treat from director Stephen Chbosky! Ordinarily, if you tell me a Julia Roberts – Owen Wilson movie is opening, I would experience nightmares of Malcolm McDowell in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE with his eyelids forced open by metal prongs attached to a head immobilizer (Don't expect any other reviews of this film to reference the Kubrick classic). It's based on the New York Times bestseller and it's a throwback to the days of sweet message films that don't require explanations before recommending.",2017
8,"Reminds me in parts to ""Mask"". An example of never judging a book by its cover.A little sentimental and schmaltzy in parts , which is very much the American way of making films, but if this is overlooked and the film is taken at face value then it is very interesting. It shows how children can be cruel but also how disfigurement can be overcome by warmth of character. My wife was glued to it which is very rare. Very much a Ladies film but I also enjoyed it.
 Julia Roberts is her typical self - excellent , Owen Wilson shows a warmer side not usually portrayed but without doubt the most touching performance ( and worthy of recognition ) is Auggie - Jacob Tremblay. A future star in the making if ever there was one.",2018
10,"It's early in the 2017 Holiday and Christmas season--well, at least from a normal person's perspective, not a retailer's perspective--and we now have a holiday film well worth taking time away from all the hubbub to enjoy. After being thoroughly depressed by ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" (even though I normally love a season-tweaking R-rated comedy during the holidays) seeing ""Wonder"" was (yes, I know what I'm about to say is a cliché, but it fits this particular film perfectly) like a cold, bracing, and refreshing breath of fresh air. The less you know about it before viewing the more joyous your viewing experience will be, so I'll just say it's one holiday film I hope will become an annual tradition along with the likes of ""It's A Wonderful Life, ""White Christmas,"" and ""A Christmas Story."" While ""Wonder"" is not specifically meant as a ""Christmas"" or holiday film, it fits the more joyous and kind themes of the holiday season that are supposedly the core reason we even bother to celebrate them.",2017
6,"In essence it's a feel-good film with life-affirming, heart-warming tendencies and the usual core themes of family, friendship and discovering your true self, seen in most of these coming-of-age dramas, alongside its more unique yet universal subjects of inclusion, equality and general kindness, and the flick always does a decent job of making its characters and their issues both believable and empathetic but never manages to get out of the general generic space we've seen so many times before; on top of this is an over-reliance on at times heavy-handed, 'tell-not-show' narration - the oldest narrative conceit in the book, this time most likely lifted straight from the book on which the piece is based - and the odd choice to throw up character name title cards as pseudo chapter-breaks (more than likely another hold-out from the source novel) but then not adhere to them in any consistent or meaningful way, still the feature is enjoyable and occasionally somewhat affecting despite its short-comings and overly long run-time, something not at all helped by its generally unfocused and plot- light nature. 6/10",2017

The movie focuses mainly on the time when Auggie is sent to a regular school by his Mom, against Auggie's Dad's wishes. Auggie faces all types of obstacles / problems that an individual experiences among a group of similar-looking people ; being stared / frowned at , being accepted with doubts and suspicions , being bullied.

6,"A Hollywood movie about a deformed boy battling adversities starring Owen Wilson? Yes, it's exactly as predictable as it sounds. I hate to sound like a cynical old man (I'm actually only 22 with the mind of a fifty year-old whoops) but I've sat through my fair share of schmaltz which mainstream audiences seem to lap up. People seem to be completely sucked in by the manipulative tearjerkers which we've seen over the past few decades such as My Sisters Keeper and Marley and Me, but ultimately, they're sentimental nonsense and therefore phony.",2017
6,"I watched this film with a school group, and while it has a good lesson in it, the lesson feels very forced. The screenwriters seemed to pick out the best quotes from the novel and squeeze as many as them as they could into the screenplay. A lot of the narration was unnecessary, the film tells you what happens instead of showing. The chapter structure seemed unnecessary as well; it was not unusual for a character's chapter to give said character five minutes of screen time at the start, but forget whose chapter it is halfway through. The last forty-five minutes of the movie is Miranda's chapter, but she is only mentioned shortly in the start, barely being developed while the film expects us to sympathize with her. The jokes are dumb, and August's character made me wince. There were a lot of clichés in it as well, but there were some unintentionally funny scenes, such as the scene where Miranda stares into August's window for five minutes creating a hilariously campy shot. I could also add the hilarious group Minecraft session to this list as well. However there was some good cinematography, with nice shots of Coney Island, and Jack blocked behind a statue of an angel to signify his kindness. Overall, the movie is cliché, annoying, and boring.",2017

And if you appreciate long-form storytelling focusing more on human drama than on action scenes, AND you're a bit of a science nerd on top of that (and by that I'm also implying you don't mind watching a show where people are talking most of the time), then, my friend, you are in for a treat.",2018
9,"I hate it when people give reviews or ratings after half-assed watching just 2 or 3 episodes. Yes, Mindhunter is a slow burner and yes, it's not fast-paced or exciting. If you want that, go somewhere else. Mindhunter is a 'thinking piece' of work where you have to watch and see where it goes while having your mind whirring and contemplating the difficult questions the show poses. Why are serial killers so fascinating to us? The Ed Kemper in the show was just riveting, as were the other serial killers they interviewed. The main characters pose interesting questions and are complex individuals, and towards the end of the series this poses conflict. ",2017
9,"Two episodes in and I'm already hooked. Technically speaking, this series is very good (it's directed by David Fincher, of course it's good) and it stays true (so far) to the real-life crimes it was based on. I can't say the same for the characters, and how close they are to the people who really did this work, but considering their names are different and the book they adapted wasn't some sort of biography, most of their personal (love) lives must be fictitious or at least overtly dramatized.",2017

I look forward to a season 2!",2017
9,"Loved the feel of this new series. Intelligent and slow burning. Totally absorbing. I thought the two main characters were very well observed and portrayed.

If you're fascinated by the psychology and methodology of a serial killer, you should watch the entire series. It does start off slow, but well worth the wait. When it comes to ""Mind Hunter,"" patience is a virtue!",2017
8,"I'm spoiled for good quality TV shows that are intriguing and make me think while entertaining along the way. So many shows I watch the first episode and can't even get through it because its so predictable or cookie cutter. I'm excited I've found a new one to enjoy. And even though it is set in the 70s, its very relevant for today. Crazy takes on many forms. Back then it was ""sequence killers"" prior to term ""serial killer"" being used. Today its crazy mass shooters. I love Ford's desire to learn. I've watched 2 episodes and looking forward to the rest. And BTW the soundtrack is amazing!",2017

9,"I find the premise of this show fascinating and it is, thankfully, focusing on what I believe to be the most intriguing and most ""entertaining"" bits and pieces of a serial killers life and actions. If you compere this show with, for example, Criminal Minds, this is a much better show, a much more realistic show. I always liked Criminal Minds, especially the first seasons, because the focus was/is as much on the killer and the psychology of the violent mind as on the people trying to catch the killer. I do however also, somewhat, dislike Criminal Minds because the team do end up in shootings, car chases and are way too much involved in action to give me that realistic feel. This show does not let the main characters shot 25 rounds and break into buildings each episode to catch/kill the ""monster"" of the week. In other words if you like action, big shot-outs, shaky cams and sexy good looking people hunting down killers this show is not for you. ",2017

Although I am not an expert in the field, It's easy to recognize the meticulous attention to detail given toward the creation of ""Mindhunter."" The cast and associated acting were spectacular. Joe Penhall (Writer of ""The Road"") has put together another gritty, texture-filled, masterpiece using actual profiles of some of the most prolific serial killers of the late 60's, early 70's. I highly recommend this title!",2017
10,I watched the first episode and I liked it just as I do love other Fincher works.The Thing that annoys me is that there are always people whit patronizing manner lashing out others and calling them stupid because they think they know more and others do not have aesthetic vision.Personally I think shows like Mr Robot or mindhunter are great shows and like other great things they're not meant to be entertaining for every individual.So giving 0 or 1 to these titles means it's not for you so please you guys stop misdirecting the audience and don't watch things you don't like or watch them and say you just didn't like it or it wasn't your type.I'm not saying don't criticize.I'm just saying if you're going to criticize you must be honest and fair.But these days it is so hard to find fair reviews in IMDb or metacritic.It was funny for me when I saw a fully negative audience review (with 0 rating) about Mr robot season 3 in metacritic and when I checked his history I noticed he had rated season 1 and 2 with 0 and written negative reviews.Basically I think when Sb doesn't like a show they just quit watching!! So please write fair reviews so that people can decide to watch the show. I recommend this show to Fincher fans and I'm sure most of his fans will love the show as they watch it.It was a bit slow in the first episode but it's not wise to judge a show based on one episode.So far I've related to the show (with some minor problems) and I think it can reach higher levels while it goes ahead.,2017
6,"Mindhunter is the single most overrated series in years. Why is it that people are euphoric about it? Have the standards fallen that much? Neither me nor my wife have, at any point, been truly gripped by the stories. Let's try to rationalize why. Technically, in terms of 'production value', Mindhunter offers everything you could ask for. It all looks perfectly seventies (with one BIG exception: the people), the camera work is top of the bill. But that's not why you watch a series. Then what is it? Is it Holden Fords boring (Hannah Gross) girlfriend Debbie, an aloof, left-wing graduate student, who has no business at all to be in the series? Is it Holden Ford himself, with this increasingly irritating, innocent and slightly surprised, boyish look on his face, who shows little if any emotion at any time? Is it the neurotic 'I'm all ratio and have no emotions or maybe I am just oppressing them'- Dr. Wendy who spews out her lines like a robot and has an instant explanation for literally everything, a caricature of a psychologist. My favorite line was her answer as to why the murderer ironed his victim's hair: 'That's how he shows his dominance'.",2017

10,"To say that I am a fanatic about shows involving criminal psychology is a gross understatement. I am a veteran of the genre, and thus, easily bored with shoddy character sketch work and less than intelligently thought out plots. Mindhunter is everything but, and I mean everything. Every moment is monumental. The pauses are as riveting as the occasional action, like one gigantic tapestry, its beauty hinging on the the juxtaposition of patterns and colors nestled together. This is a show about the development of Behavioral Science as it relates to serial killers. One after the next the psychology of killers are unraveled through techniques that are routinely called into question, but vindicated, keeping the plot lines alive and well and the characters true to their core values. The interviews themselves are intense and unsettling, mostly because one has no idea what might happen when dangerous criminals are left unchained in a closed space with unprotected FBI agents. But how else would they gain their trust? This is one of the show's most distinctive elements, that you never know what will happen in the presence of almost unfathomable darkness. I honestly wondered to myself where they found the actors who portrayed these manipulative monsters. They were all so masterful, and this applies as well to all of the characters, both central or secondary. The tenth episode opened a door to new territory of psychological horror that I cannot wait to follow into the second season. The ONLY show in this particular genre on par with this one is the first season of True Detective. If you were a fan of that show, you'll love this. One final note, the female characters in Mindhunter are all strong, intelligent, insightful...and off putting. This may bother some, but understand the time frame and this begins to make sense.",2017

2,"I don't leave reviews often but this was bad. I wanted to like the main character but I just couldn't bring myself to care about him at all. His expressions are wooden and his demeanor is not one of an FBI agent. Where I lost it though, was at the scene where he meets the sociologist at the bar, about 20 minutes into the first episode. This was bad TV if I've ever seen it. The scene just felt way too drawn out. The script was so bad that I couldn't even warrant an eye roll. No, I just sat there in a state of confusion as to how anyone in the industry would let writing like this fly. There's absolutely no sense of fluidity to it. Might as well have had the characters reading off of a teleprompter. And you know, it's highly believable that anyone with the background of an FBI agent would hop in a car to ride shotgun with a drunk ass that he just met at a bar, only to be pressured into smoking dope upon arriving at her apartment. Just kind of makes sense, right?",2017
3,"Sometimes, it feels like you're the only sane person in a sea of ignorance. Or the other way around. But WHAT is the appeal of this show? I barely got through the first episode: the acting was absolutely horrendous. Objectively, horribly terrible. The dialogue was what first-year philosophy students think is haughty and intellectual. It's not. It's the first five paragraphs of a wikipedia article, over and over and over. ",2017
1,"I'm utterly shocked that people don't notice how bad the acting is in this series. The main character is wooden and completely bereft of any personality or likability. The few pathetic attempts at comedic relief fall flat and are as embarrassing as the stilted ""chemistry"" between the leads. Just finished the final episode and nothing of interest has taken place, no new insight, no suspense, just pure unadulterated tedium. The period music attempts to make the show fun yet seems contrived. The pseudo-romantic subplot is an exercise in how to not write relationship drama. Big geographic location names are superimposed over each new locale and try to fool us into thinking we're part of some epic plot line. Awkward sideways glances abound and long ponderous pauses by the leads help to break up the consistently sophomoric dialogue. I feel bad for the main character's girlfriend as he has miraculously proved himself to be more of a bore than this show. I would rather be the victim of a serial killer than be forced to watch this drivel again. Fincher should be ashamed as should anyone stupid enough to think this passes for good television.",2017
10,"The more you watch this series the more you keep watching! I thought my husband would not like this series but he could not stop watching either. We watched the whole ten episodes over less than two days. What makes this show worth such a high score? It is faultless. The acting is excellent. You can feel the dramatic tension and atmosphere. It is not the usual serial killer series. It is about how modern psychological profiling began and the people who shaped it including the criminals. The setting is the 1970s when people were not advantaged technologically. It is not a documentary but an explanation and description of the beginning of understanding how serial killers are formed. The characters, namely the people working in the unit that was set up to analyse the serial killer's mind, all have lives of their own. We are privy to those as well which include a wife and a child, a girlfriend, etc. They are people who are also flawed and with personal issues. But the main story is the scientific deconstructing of the the mind of the serial killer. The further into the series you watch the better it gets. It might start out an 8 but ends up a 10.",2017
3,"I was excited about this show. Deep psychological analysis of serial killers? Not super new but sounds interesting at the very least. After the first episode, though, I can't continue any further. I hate to a give a review without giving a full chance to the show but this is too much. The main character could not be more wooden and boring, and really, nothing happens. There's the occasional bloody or sexy scene, which I guess helps in making trailers and teasers, but other than that, nothing. There's a crap-ton of pointless dialogue between characters that is delivered so forcefully and so awkwardly that almost every time someone talks, you get the sense that this is all so unrealistic. Not much of a story, no real striving to any particular idea, and most importantly, not much at all of what you probably watched it to see. I give it a 3 because if anything, it looks nice I guess. But with all that said, what's really puzzling is how on Earth it has such high ratings!",2017
2,"The plot is tedious, the dialogue is absurd and the acting is at best very wooden. It is not a ""slow burner"", its just very boring, badly executed TV! How could Fincher/Groff inflict such misery on us unsuspecting viewers, will make sure to give their work a miss in the future.",2017

If you actually want a  movie where you know everything already starting from the story,  characters and twists then I'd call you the stupidest ever. Yes this  isn't your typical king Arthur movie, and that adds even more to the  awesomeness of it.amnt saying the movie is flawless, no movie is, but  it was great starting from acting, animation, story, music tracks,  everything.

2,"Wow. I don't even know where to start with this trainwreck. King Arthur is one of those classic stories (like Robin Hood or Zorro or Tarzan) that Hollywood likes to dust off every decade or so, spend an ungodly amount of money on it and then promptly regret it. There have been many King Arthur movies over the years, but this one is something special. This movie is hilarious. I laughed so hard that I cried at one point. The problem, of course, is that this isn't a comedy. But I haven't laughed this hard at the movies since Crimson Peak (note: also not a comedy). ",2017

If you don't get/understand the (British) humour (i.e you don't think the jokes are funny), dialogue and fast ""flashbacky"" editing style presented in Lock Stock and Snatch, you will hate this movie. Easy as that. For us who understand what constitutes a Ritchie movie will be more likely than not, like the movie.",2017
2,"I made it through twenty minutes. It has possibly the worst video editing that I've ever seen in a film in my life. I didn't even know what I was watching sometimes during those twenty minutes. They cut from one meaningless thing to another like it was vital to a story element when, in fact, it was just a supposedly cool ""Suicide Squad"" style sequence. It also had two video montages during those twenty minutes, which was intolerable, partly because they were done in the same frantic and headache-inducing manner that the regular cuts were shot in.",2017
3,"Guy Ritchie, in my opinion, should better stay with his genres and not touch history. Neither characters are represented well nor atmosphere is created. All famous Ritchie's tricks are not fit for the story like this, where the atmosphere is much more important than jumps and fighting. Many banal patterns which completely do not fit with the ancient England. I don't think there were ""cool"" guys talking with each other as rappers in that time. The movie is an expensive fail.",2017
8,"Wow, this is one heck of a movie. I was overwhelmed with some of the scenes, especially the fighting scenes in the beginning, the middle and also in the end. There was a wonderful opening credit scene which I felt was very awesome. It lasted probably only 5 minutes but it really impressed me. And, the movie also had some brief parts which were fun to see, like the scene when Arthur was telling the story about the Vikings. Out of the whole fighting scenes, the one that I enjoyed most was in the middle which I felt was rather breathtaking and having an ultimate amazing ending.",2017

10,The true test of a fantastic movie is when you get immersed in it. When the show grabs your attention at the onset and keeps you interested the entire time. Your mind doesn't wander about anything else but whats happening on the silver screen. And that is precisely what this movie does. Loved the beginning with the fantasy action. Immediately developed a dislike for the villain well played by Law. Charlie Hunnam had the presence and moxie to carry the lead role for the first time. Most characters were very well developed and the story line was tight. Really enjoyed the soundtrack too. Entertainment at its finest.,2017

10,Few months ago when I watched the trailer and considering the fact that Guy Ritchie is directing this I knew one thing for sure - this movie will NOT BE a King Arthur story. What happens here is that Ritchie took the concept of the King Arthur and Excalibur's myths and made a movie out of them in a way only he can (reference - Sherlock Holmes).,2017
1,"There are very little redeeming qualities about this mess of a film, and it really is a mess. If I had to walk away with a positive though, I would say the music was pretty good for the most part. ",2017
1,"Movie trailers are interesting. You as the viewer get to see a prospective film and be taken in by this 30 second or 60 second or even a two minutes and 30 second capsule of a two hour film. And when that time comes, you are sometimes rewarded fr your efforts and sometimes you are not. King Arthur had such promise with it's trailer and alas, it failed to live up to its promises. I went in expecting an action packed event but what I got was unnecessary expositions and a lot of unnecessary dialogue that bloated the film's running time. Let's assume we know the legend of King Arthur pulling the sword out of the stone. This version of King Arthur does that but with a twist, he passes out, not once, not twice but three times. This got tiresome the first time. When he grabs the sword out of the stone in front of the soldiers and the people, I was hoping for the first true action sequence to happen, sort of a medieval John Wick moment where he kicks ass sword style but that didn't happen. The film drags down and flat lines. ",2017
2,"What do you expect from a director who gave us ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E"" and ""Swept Away"" ? These CGI dominated films are really getting to be so boring, and often incomprehensible. The director doesn't have to do much, the animation department takes over, and plot and dialogue get left behind. Any thought of a franchise for King Arthur are hopefully dashed with this very poor product and terrible box office. Guy Ritchie.... please stop directing.",2017

1,I saw this movie as a new release a few days ago. It was one of only two movies available in the small town where I was.,2017
10,"At its most basic, the story of King Arthur boils down to this: He was a fabled king of Britain in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, whose legend has grown and expanded over the millennium and a half since. Historically, we don't know for sure whether Arthur actually existed, but literarily, not only can his existence not be denied, but it cannot be avoided. Tales of the great king and his court, called Camelot, his wife Guinevere, his right-hand-man Lancelot and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table, his wizard Merlin and Arthur's magical sword Excalibur have been told, retold, changed and embellished over the centuries by books, stage productions and other media, including, of course, television and film. A countless number of TV shows and movies have referenced the legends and many have used ""Excalibur"", ""Camelot"" and, of course, ""Arthur"" in their titles. In 2017, auteur Guy Ritchie gets into the game with the action-adventure-drama ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" (PG-13, 2:06), the first in a series of films reinterpreting the Arthurian legend with Ritchie's signature creative flare for reinvention. In launching a new franchise, Ritchie gives us an origin story which expounds upon the age-old tales, introduces new elements and characters and combines other stories and legends into a cohesive whole.",2017

Cruise's character was likable, and while his arc wasn't that deep, it didn't really need to be. The mummy actress impressed me more than I expected, since I didn't really like her that much in Kingsman. People said that this spent too much time setting up the following movies, but I didn't think that was the case. There were small seeds planted, but save for the ending and lack of background for Jekyll, this felt self contained enough. Overall the movie had some fun action sequences and decent characters, and made for an enjoyable popcorn flick. I do not regret watching it.",2017

3,"""The Mummy"" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their ""Dark Universe."" Yeah, that's right. Those re-shoots that 2014's ""Dracula Untold"" went through to tie into a Dark Universe; those don't matter now. That 2010 Benicio del Toro ""Wolfman"" movie; also doesn't matter. ",2017
8,"I don't know what people were looking for to rate this so low. It has a good story, especially related to other stories of its ilk. The problem is that they sink too much cash in something like this, without thinking of the consequences. There is clearly supposed to be a sequel, but we all know that this is based upon good box office, and well, that is somewhat weird as fr as how they now deem that a success. I guess 50 million in profit world wide is chump change to these people. One thing is clear as always. If your going to do another in the same genre, you better get more than 15 years over the deal, so its new in people's minds. Anyone with any commons sense at all would know this. And to spend 327 million on it, is beyond insanity. Unfortunately, audiences that liked it will be deprived of one by such short sightedness. As well as the critics weird dislike of Cruise. Personal dislike of an actor in real life, regardless of how uncouth it is, or in speculation of motivations in production, has NOTHING to do with a movie. To me, the story is everything, and its a good one, with effects that merely emphasize it, which is always my criteria in whether a movie is good or not. Sofia Boutella is riveting in this role, especially in the way her unconventional beauty is emphasized by her extreme talent. Its her and Eva Green, who are at the forefront of this type of great young actress of the future. There is no prejudice here. I rate it as I see it, and not with any preconceived notions. Its worth the watch.",2017
8,"I didn't watch this with the expectation of being blown away by the story line. I wasn't expecting to be moved emotionally or even invested in the characters at all. That's probably why I rated it so high compared to others. My only expectation was to be entertained and the movie delivered. The effects were alright, the acting OK, the story kind of thrown together, but it worked for what I wanted. ",2017

1,"I've never written a movie review before, but after seeing this one I just had to, I was so disappointed. I was a kid when the previous Mummy series came out, and those movies were infinitely more interesting/entertaining. Its a huge disappointment because this film falls apart for several reasons:",2017
3,"The Mummy has had countless iterations of the character grace the screen for the better part of the 20th Century. With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.",2017
2,"Disappointed...no real story line, predictable events, and choice of a particular character line was lame... Lots of holes in the story... Story jumped all over without real connections to plot...

7,"It's never good when you have to say ""It's not that bad!"" but I think the Mummy is being treated to harshly by critics. It has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Really? It's not a great movie, but it is fun to watch and I thought the ending was very good. It felt a bit like a B- Movie in the beginning, but I still enjoyed it. ",2017

7,"The Mummy provides good entertainment, at least most of the time. The effects are expectedly very impressive and the performances are first rate as well. My favorite performances were from the Mummy actor Sofia Boutella as the evil Ahmanet and Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll. Sofia is sexy and has very expressive eyes. Russell Crowe brings in the needed humor to this serious flick. Tom Cruise as the adventurous Nick impresses in drama, action and fun moments and the pretty Annabelle Wallis as archaeologist Jenny whom he loves also delivers very well although her role is comparitively overshadowed by that of Cruise and Sofia. I like the action scenes and also the humor in this otherwise dark movie yet the end falters. Cruise's character undergoes a transformation in the climax which I felt weakened an otherwise good horror entertainment. One usually connects with the lead character from start to end of a movie but here, the climax spoilt it for me, not because of what happens to him but how that was executed. Anyway, this movie is still watchable despite the flaws but I'd not root for a sequel unless Sofia Boutella is back to haunt me again :)",2017
1,"The only scary thing about this ""horror"" movie is how bad it is. It should have been buried in a tomb full of mercury and sealed up for eternity. Without Tom Cruise stumbling over it as a Lara Croft/Indiana Jones wannabe literally dropped from the sky right into the middle of the key to the riddle, the one that other poor suckers have been searching for during thousands of years. Lucky him? Hold on, it gets worse. Ole' Nick finds himself neck-deep in a quagmire, not so much of ancient artifacts and killer zombie-inducing spiders (deary me, who comes up with all this rubbish?), but of incoherent and random movie ideas, CGI-arrhoea, stupidly recycled themes, and plot holes bigger than the giant-*ss one he repels down into at the beginning of the movie. And, of course, the obligatory sequel-connecting non-ending, petering out in a sea of greed and ringing tills. It's all for the money, and you gotta wonder why Tom Cruise is immersing himself into this garbage pit of Hollow-wood waste. But then again, it's expensive to be a Scientologist, somebody's gotta pay the Dianetics bills. Too bad it happened to be me this time.",2017

This is a re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of movies but with a whole new agenda. This time Universal are making these films to link in with all their other monster movies, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman etc so comparing it with any other Mummy film before it like the critics keep doing is utterly pointless.

Populated with super beings, over which none will claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already. It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.",2017

But when a movie has nothing else to offer besides a selection of 1980s pop hits and washed-out shots of a largely fictional Berlin, I tend to get bored. And boy, did this contrived McGuffin chase bore me to death. The paper-thin plot only exists to somehow string the various stunt, fight, sex and car chase scenes together. The fact that many of the positive reviews laud Charlize Theron's physical appearance and gush about the lesbian sex scene shows how utterly forgettable the entire rest of this movie is.

Not to mention the rest of the cast perfectly meshed in this flick (from James McAvoy & Toby Jones to John Goodman & Sofia Boutella), while the story made you yearning for more.

The cinematography goes beautifully with the OST - a collection of original and remixed new wave/dark wave 80s hits - which I really enjoyed. It's unfortunate that the director couldn't elevate the film into something more sophisticated. ",2017
9,"Atomic Blond it's an action movie, with a lavish style and the music shuffle on just to enjoy the moment. The movie follows the same rules of action movies from the 80's and the 90's: you have the problematic mission, the good ""guy"", the bad guys, the questionable guy and the sexy girls (women). But because a woman is in the lead role, Charlize Theron (instead of Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis or Silvester Stallone), the dynamic of the movie is a fresh breeze. She's not clumsy or in conflict with her abilities, (like most of the female agents in movies) she is a great agent send to deal with a problem and in the processes stumbles with an another problem that she handles in the best way, she knows possible. The thriller/mystery plot stumbles a little bit in the narrative, but that doesn't spoil the thrill of the action sequences, the beautiful choreography of the fights or the great music, and fixes some of 80's and 90's problems, like only strong and intelligent men, only silly sexy girls, no women, racist and sexist jokes, all of that without being boring. It is a popcorn action movie inspired by 80's with the intelligence of today's society.",2017

Charlize Theron is cool just like the ice cubes in those bath-tube she takes in the movie. The other actors are OK, but due to Charlize's extremely strong personality, they all seem to be just a bunch of extras. Very good action, dynamically, nervously and spectacularly filmed.

2,"From the first scene of the movie it is clear that this will be more about Charlize Theron being hot that it will be about a female led action movie. She is in a tub naked icing herself down. She is slightly battered and slightly bruised. Nothing that would indicate serious injury or more important make her less attractive. I have no doubt the executives told Charlize that she could be the lead of an action movie, but she would have to be naked throughout the movie. The script itself is dull and unoriginal. The movie is stylish and Charlize is naked often, has naked lesbian sex scenes and she wears thigh high boots and garter belts in the fight scenes. It is more porn than plot. Rather than show a woman using intelligence or creativity to fight men, it rather implausibly has you believe that a woman would have the same strength as a man. It is almost comical to see this slight woman take a punch from a man or knockout a guy or have the strength to choke a guy or throw him. The fight scenes have a lot of Charlize grunting and sickening violence to make you forget how unrealistic it would be even for a male action movie. The film is meant to be more porn than ""girl power"" including the scene where a woman is strangled to death on a bed in lingerie. If this is what female led action movies are going to be like, I hope they fail.",2017

I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show.

The 1920´s in Berlin is such a fascinating time. The series takes us into a shady Berlin with corruption, sex, social issues, new culture and a vibrant nightlife. 
The storyline and has a nice built up, which makes us familiar with the characters and stage. What I found most enjoyable is the variaty and detail fused with a great atmosphere, that creates a sometimes dark and nostalgic vibe.
The vibe is enhanced with the interesing characters and a great acting performances.

Since I had read the books not too long before watching the series, I got confused because of those differences, mixing up the images in my head and on screen, so make sure to leave some time between reading and watching.
I can really recommend the books, they are well reasearched, they are historically accurate and give many nice details about the Berlin of that period.
I'm not expert enough to say if the changes and additions made in the series are still as accurate, but the production team consulted a historian while producing it.",2018

I like to watch foreign shows in their original language with subtitles. Great Danish shows like The Killing, Borgen, The Bridge or the Belgian show The Break. American or English shows would not think of using this re-dubbing method, also called ADR, Looping to this extend. It might occasionally be used to fix something but not for the whole show. Instead a lot of effort goes into using the audio that is recorded during filming. I'm used to the authenticity that we get with that.

5,"I have to give it a 5, because honestly, my wife loved it, so there is something there. It's not a ""thinker"", and it's not clever. I think the best way to describe it is a good movie you can watch while doing something else.",2017
4,This has to be one of the worst of Steven's movies. The script and directing was horrible. The characters and pace of the movie was so slow and highly unrealistic that many people just walked out of the theatre.,2017
8,"I saw this film at a drive-in, and it was the second film in the double feature I had gone to see. For the culturally deprived, drive-ins still show two features. Anyway, this film was a revelation. At first I had expected that the working-class characters would fall into their designated stereotypes and we'd chug along to an easily-expected finish.",2017
4,"Once again I'm not really all that sure why I saw this because even though it is a heist movie, it pretty much follows the cookie cutter script that seems to be the standard for heist movies. In fact I saw another heist movie earlier this year that was almost identical except that the main characters were pensioners who had been diddled out of their retirement as opposed to a bunch of hicks whose injuries have resulted them being left on the scrap heap, and when I say almost identical I actually mean literally scene for scene.",2017
8,"A few years ago director Steven Soderbergh made no secret of his waning passion for filmmaking. He announced his intention to retire from feature films following the release of 2013's Behind the Candelabra and cited his desire to pursue other creative interests. Well, it may have taken four years (and a brief stint directing TV's The Knick) to reignite his filmmaking passion, but Soderbergh proves his hand behind the camera is as assured as ever in the rollicking heist caper Logan Lucky.",2017
10,"I liked it even more after reading Steven Soderbergh's interview about cutting out big studios from the profits and sharing it with the crew instead. Good for him! ""The film is also an answer to questions he's been grappling with his whole career: What if you could make a movie that cut out studios entirely, allowing the filmmaker to do as he or she pleased? What if infamously shady studio accounting could be reduced to something as simple as a password-protected website, where everyone involved with the film— from the producers to the costume designer to Adam Driver— could simply log on and see how much money the film had made, and what percentage of that money was theirs?""",2017

8,"Logan Lucky tells the story of Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), a man down on his luck. He lost his job on a construction site because he has a limp he didn't report when he applied (and doesn't affect his job as a driver). He's divorced with a wife moving away who has full custody of his daughter. He has a brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost his hand in one of the many wars. It's referred to locally as the Logan Curse. The Logans' simply seem unable to catch a break.",2017
1,"I'm not going to pretend I'm a professional critic and write a novel- length review...that's just pretentious. But I do want to say this: Logan Lucky sucked. It wasn't even remotely funny. It was extremely slow, dragged on, and the ending--I ticked the spoiler box just in case, but believe me, there's nothing to spoil--the ending felt so much like a cheap, lousy cop-out. Lousy, lousy, movie.",2017
3,"While the characters did a good job with their roles, this movie is nowhere near anything like Oceans 11,12,13. The movie is way too long, drags like a ton of bricks, and is NOT smart by any stretch of the imagination. It is dumb, dumb, dumb. It is a heist movie with a every coincidence happening at exactly the right time and laughable misses by the guards and police. Seth Rogan was a waste. Hillary Swank is supposed to be a Joe Friday tough detective but is laughable with her artificial gruff voice. I think you get the picture.",2017

4,"Logan Lucky: Sometimes You're too Clever Logan Lucky (LL) is too clever for it's own good. The film has some big laugh lines and a lot of cleverness, but it is implausible to a fault. Sure, it's a work of fiction, but it has to pass the the credulity test. LL fails several times. The film involves a heist, a divorce, a prison break out and break in, car swapping, money swapping, wife swapping. Well, not the last one. ",2017
1,"Imagine taking a room full of junior high school kids and asking them to dream up a script for a heist movie. Guaranteed, whatever the kids came up with would be better than this nonsensical dud.

4,"Slooooow. I believe some of the tedium was intentional (i.e. these are mentally dim characters so everything they say or do is slow), but the scenes felt heavy handed and went on too long in trying to make sure that everyone watching would understand what the scene was trying to say. And there were far too many subplots that were either unnecessary or didn't go anywhere. The actors did a great job with what they had to work with, there were many excellent performances, and the main plot was clever, but the direction was poor. With a better director this might have been a good movie.",2017
8,"OK, stop me when you've heard this one:",2017
4,"On the surface, Logan Lucky has a heck of a lot going for it. It's got a zillion-dollar cast. Everyone loves a good ""lovable outcasts pull off the heist"" tale. It tries to tap into the Appalachian quirkiness that made ""Justified"" such an institution. It's almost worth eight bucks just to see if Daniel Craig can act all ""muricann."" And yes, Channing Tatum is actually pretty convincing as a hard-workin' country boy down on his luck. And there's plenty of John Denver references! ",2017
8,"Logan Lucky is first and foremost a heist movie. Arguably it's the first of its kind this decade, since the last time a really good movie of this stripe has focused on downhill good 'ol boys pulling an all-American snatch-and-grab, Burt Reynolds was still relevant. In its advertising the film mentions itself in the same breath as Ocean's Eleven (2001) but aside from both having the same director, the two couldn't be more miles apart. One's about career confidence men drinking fancy martinis. The other's about petty criminals snatching chump change from concession drawers. One's essentially Michael Caine, the other is Steve Martin.",2017

9,"This film was better (and much different) than I expected. At first the pace seemed very slow and the story predictable and seen-it-before. But then the pace picked up and you really get into the characters (of which every single one was cast and played their role perfectly) and the story (which overall was very well written - especially the ending). The ending had an obscure twist forming, but right at the very end, it comes together for a grand finale! Very enjoyable and I'm definitely watching this one again. It's a 9/10 from me.",2017
8,"One of the main reasons that I began writing movie reviews is to bring attention to good, entertaining flicks that might be flying under your radar.  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's latest heist flick LOGAN LUCKY.  This is an entertaining movie that moves quickly and has much more under the surface than you might first think.",2017
2,"I wanted to like this film. I really did. As a fan of the Fifth Element, I was expecting to find a well-developed plot, kitchy humor, memorable characters, and over-the-top action sequences. It had the action, but no soul. Neither of the two main characters had the acting chops to carry a scene, even the 'witty' banter came of scripted and flat as if Ben Stein had taken a heavy dose of lithium and stumble on set. The story also had several faux pas, including adding characters to advance parts of the story, only to kill them off a few minutes later.",2017

3,I have never written a movie review in my life but I was so outraged after taking my family and some friends to see Valerian I have decided to try and save some other poor soul from falling for the special effects trap.

10,"Although I too enjoy super hero movies, action movies blah blah - they are getting tired. Good directors can get the pacing, directing and acting so right that the same-ol story can be told while still be entertaining.

7,"Adapted from Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières long-running French sci-fi comics series Valérian And Laureline. Luc Besson creates a stunning visual feast. Besson's attention to detail is immaculate. And that along side the quirky dialog's between Laureline and Valerian are what keep this film afloat. I might be in the minority, but I prefer my films to be lengthy. However in this case, Valerian feels overstuffed trying to add more depth to the story at every turn. This film might have benefited from a shorter run time. The biggest surprise was Laureline(Delevingne), her character is what kept my interest throughout the film and her acting was actually on point. As someone who was skeptical about her casting, I'm glad to be proved wrong. Not saying it's her breakout performance, Just saying she's improving and perhaps she might have a future as an actress. Everyone deserves a second chance.",2017
7,"The Hollywood line-up this year doesn't provide anything remotely interesting. So don't let a shaky story-line, unnecessary dialogue and slightly hammy acting dissuade you from watching the most stunning visuals since ""Avatar"".",2017
8,"The first thing you'll observe about Luc Besson's Valerian is how gorgeous it looks, how much work went into the perfect realisation of this world. In a time where nearly every blockbuster features tons of CGI, Valerian stands out and highlights how cheaply the effects are done in most of the other ones.",2017
3,"Jeez. This movie. I loathe nearly everything about this film, but let's go ahead and knock out these positives. ",2017
1,"How could a director who was able to so cleverly match over-the-top Chris Tucker with dead-pan, straight arrow Bruce Willis in ""The Fifth Element"" end up with the two most banal characters ever, Dana DeHaan and Cara Delevingne? Throughout the film the only action you could look forward to was one or both of them being blasted into small bits or eaten by one of the many monsters. When they would open their mouths you wondered if you were on some college campus.Their dialogue was childish, insipid, and totally devoid of the kind of adult emotion that drew you into ""Leon:The Professional"" or ""La Femme Nikita"". Besson has no excuse here; he directed and wrote this mess. I love Luc Besson's previous films. However, this was such a disappointment, you have to wonder what the value will be for his upcoming remakes, Lucy 2 and Columbiana 2.",2017
1,"This movie would have been pretty good if not for the horrible acting from Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne, and their high-school romance is ham-fisted and stupid. They're probably the worst actors I've ever seen, and they drag down this movie like an anchor. Apart from the leads this movie was visually stunning and could have been something great.",2017
10,"Watching 'Valerian and the City of Thousand Planets' I was reminded what makes Science Fiction so enjoyable. It's not the space fights, the cool alien life forms, the futuristic metropolis. It's that all these things remind us how infinite this space is, how tiny our existence, and how precious.",2017
1,I am a big sci-fi fan and I love a good big budget movie but unfortunately I was very disappointed with this film.,2017
1,"When I first saw the trailer for this, and being a huge fan of the (Vastly superior) Fifth Element, as well as Leon the Professional, I could hardly wait to see it. What a mistake! I should have waited. A terrible story cannot be supported by great visuals. This was one boring, almost unfollowable story. The leads are pretty, but the inane dialogue waste's them totally. The entire SciFi part is wrapped around a basically horny Valerian wanting to settle down with his fellow agent. The opening, about the building of station Alpha is the best part. The rest of the film goes downhill from there. Just a really huge mistake. After Luc's near miss with Lucy, (good until the end), I was hoping that he would rebound with this, but this is just a huge, dull (I nearly fell asleep during it) mess of a movie. So sad, since there was some serious potential here.",2017
1,"This movie must have been made by teenagers... A total lack of detail, with random scenes of fantastic colour and motion. Visually it is amazing, but most of the actors were terrible and the story lacked consistency and detail. Also, inconsistent subtitles with the non-English languages. Absolutely no chemistry between the 2 love interests. Much too long as well.",2017
8,"David Bowie introduces the first five minutes of Valerian, and perhaps its fitting we should have the Starman himself lead us into a glimpse of what the future could hold for humans and all interstellar life.By the time Mr. Bowie completes his Space Oddity, we've learned that the titular City of a Thousand Planets is the international space station hundreds of years in the future.suddenly, a peaceful seashell world is decimated without explanation.from there, Valerian and Laureline take over the action as two agents in pursuit of their stolen commander, and everything gets weird from there. Director Luc Besson is his own starman here, and he commands the world of Valerian with pizazz and passion. Not everything works, as our space agents wrestle dialogue that falls pancake flat; but the actors play well off each other and comedic moments succeed more than fail. The ending half of the film loses steam,except for Rihanna's literally acrobatic performance,but Valerian is a bonkers crazy, geeky, and likable space opera that can only come from someone who's imagination is truly free.",2017

1,"I felt robbed when I finished watching this movie. It is so bad. I do not know where to start. The story line falls flat and predictable. The visual effects were nothing special either. Acting? Some of the lines were unbearable to me. Such a waste of time and money. I admit that I fell asleep in the most recent transformers, but I did not feel as angry at that time. Or maybe I have hit a limit in terms of bad movies... Seriously, people should stop making junks like this. It is disrespectful of resources on the planet earth.",2017

In the dead of night, writer/director Luc Besson broke into STX Entertainment headquarters, and stole $209M to finance an adaptation of a French comic book <--- - I'm more apt to believe this than a check being slid across a table after this thing was pitched. Somebody please start a Go Fund Me for the studio.",2017

9,"Paddington 2 really is a fine children's movie. In fact, I would go as far as to say one of the best children's movies I have seen. It is not just charm and whimsy and genuine laughs though it has those in buckets - it is a real plot, and a solid caper movie to boot. By building on an ingenious crime element and real plotting it has turned from a sentimental journey to something more. As an avid reader of the books as a child, the main worry is the spirit of the bear who believes in the good in everyone, while creating untold chaos around him, will get lost to serve the storyline or some idea of updating Paddington. Luckily, none of the spirit is lost, and instead, we have an immensely enjoyable, fun, funny, and charming film. The whole family loved it - and we all laughed, cried, and cheered. Just be sure to stay seated for the credits. A really excellent children's film.",2017
9,I was hugely surprised at just how good the first film was and was tentatively cautious when this sequel was green-lighted that perhaps it might cheapen Michael Bond's beloved family friendly creation.,2017

This movie invoked the inner child within me and was just a perfect viewing experience for this time of the year.",2017
9,"The first Paddington film was cleverly made but just wasn't long enough. This film however lasted longer and had way more to it which made it better. Phoenix as the villain was kind of better than Millicent as he was more cunning.

I can honestly say this is the best ""children's"" film I have seen since Mary Poppins when I was 6. Like a very good marmalade it is bitter sweet, with moments of comedy that will have tears of laughter running down your cheek and moments of pathos that will do the same - a good thing I was in a darkened cinema. The animators are the star (Paddington) but special mention must be made for Hugh Grant who throws everything at this Oscar worthy role (Don't leave before the end credits or you'll miss one of the best moments) and Brendan Gleeson is suitably menacing and lovable at the same time.",2017

8,"Just like in the original movie, this one was also truly a family movie. Almost the same formula was used in here where Paddington, being a naive, friendly kind bear caught in trouble due to the bad things done by the villain, and had to be rescued by the Browns.

10,"20 November 2017 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Paddington 2. Three years after the amazing original movie Paddington bursts back onto our screen. Full of good intentions, his naivety lands him in hot water and he finds himself locked up with everyone trying to clear his name. All our old favourites are back, Hugh Bonneville as Mr Brown, Julie Walters as Mrs Bird and Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry among others, however I think the real human star of the show was Hugh Grant, who played the dastardly Phoenix Buchanan with aplomb. Phoenix is a washed up actor reduced to doing dog food commercials who takes advantage of Paddington and makes you want to yell Boo Hiss from the audience. There is some brilliant acting from everyone who is interacting with Paddington, you wouldn't know there wasn't a real talking bear there. A great film for all the family to enjoy, oh and stay sat down for the credits on this one!!!",2017
10,"On RottenTomatoes, this film currently has 184 positive reviews and ZERO negative reviews! I think it certainly deserves that. It truly is one of the best movies of all time. It's the best movie I've seen in theaters in 2018! Granted, it's the only one I've seen in theaters in 2018. What makes this movie so amazing is that it completely avoids so many traps bad movies fall into. There's no attempt at all to change anything to be relevant in modern times, nor are there any fart jokes or songs about big butts. ",2018

Gleeson is great, Grant is perfect, and the message about community is so welcome. A live-action family-comedy-adventure that's a gift to all of us, but especially to cinephile parents and their kids.",2018
9,"I can't imagine a film this year bringing so much more genuine joy and happiness to the screen. Better yet, I'm not sure I can even imagine a film that more deftly balances adventure, comedy, and touching drama. Paddington 2 is as close to a flawless film as I can remember over the last few years. Sure, I'm never going to compare it to say a film like The Dark Knight or The Lion King (two perfect films in my opinion), Paddington 2 succeeds the same way those films did, by knowing their audience and making a film that benefits the entire crowd. Sure, Paddington 2 may have been made for children, but it can be enjoyed by people (and bears) of all ages.",2018

He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.",2017
2,"Not even sure what to say about this one. Kong was 950 feet tall. And sweet. So sweet. Unless you threatened him or made him angry. Which they managed to do. I think pretty much anything that Samuel Jackson is in these days, must be avoided like the Bird flu. He is a compromised actor of extreme proportions, and will literally do anything for a buck. He is so tired. His routine is so old. Here he plays an army officer, who of course has no respect for nature, animals, or the earth. Hence the environmental statement. It is a statement that feels like it was written by a 5 year old. Hollywood being the nearly culturally bankrupt institution it is, seems to be incapable of a balance, nuanced, elegant statement of any sort. So, they keep producing this kind on inane garbage.",2017

1,"Samuel L. Jackson's character ruined this movie. I found the plot and theme to be very interesting, but so much of this movie (that I saw...walked out right after the two parties met up and decided to go look for the airman that was already dead)was just wrong. Flying helicopters, in close formation, through a hurricane so severe no ship can survive it? Ludicrous. Attacking a 300 ft. gorilla the 1st time you see it, without even considering pulling back and assessing the threat, and losing all of your helicopters in the process? Even more ludicrous. The determination, by Jackson's character, that he's going to avenge his fallen airmen and kill Kong? Just plain asinine. This seems like a dig on the military as a bunch of crazed killers, whose first instinct is to shoot and keep shooting until something, seemingly anything, is killed. Rational, thinking people don't do this. A few changes would've allowed this movie to be a wonderful adventure. ",2017
4,"I was confused about the purpose of this film, and sadly, I was still confused after watching the film. All the elements of this new version of King Kong have been recycled. Taking parts of the originals/remakes and hastily gluing them together again in a different way doesn't mean it is going to create an inventive artwork. ",2017
3,I like to see a movie that on some level is at least plausible and does not require you to suspend reality entirely to go along with what you are seeing on the screen. First why would all twelve choppers stay within striking distance of Kong after the first couple were knocked out of the sky?? And then all of them get destroyed as well - Ridiculous! Second how does a creature the size of a ten story building sneak up on the unsuspecting human characters over and over? After Kong being machine gunned early on in the film and seeing that he was bleeding heavily and in quite a bit of pain he miraculously heals as if it had never happened! The leader of the squad of pilots somehow thinks he can kill Kong to the exclusion of all rationality in the face of overwhelming adversity and convince his fellow pilots to go along with him - ludicrous! How do giant squids and the giant skull crawler appear out of nowhere in shallow water not even up to Kong's knees? I could provide many more examples but I think I have made my point clear. Whoever writes these scripts does not base things on even vaguely realistic scenarios which makes for a less than satisfying viewing experience.,2017

Making a movie just to set up future sequels is a horrible idea since it removes all tension in the movie. Although I expected the movie to be bad, I didn't expect a contender to Worst Movie of the Year (first is XxX: Return of Xander Cage). Almost everything this movie does is horrible due to bad acting, despite having big actors, bad cinematography, bad plot, and horrible characters. One mediocre thing about this movie was the special effects. So let's begin by talking about the worst thing of the movie:",2017

The leads embody characters that are all understandable and genuinely likable. The plot isn't stuffed with technical geek references and ""easter eggs"" that weigh down other universe-building films. From the fire- singed Kong fur to the slick skull crawler tongues, the special effects are brilliantly detailed and animated. And it's genuinely refreshing to watch an action/monster film in which native peoples are depicted with dignity and respect, and where black and Asian characters aren't used as props or fodder for violence (admittedly, the film could have gone further with this, but I sensed some progress being made). Kong: Skull Island isn't Life is Beautiful. It isn't Casablanca. But it is genuinely, thrillingly, rigorously fun. It has heart, scales, teeth and a ferocious roar. Monster movies are back. Get in line. Hail to the King.",2017
1,"I am not a movie snob and am easily entertained, but this movie was absolutely a complete and utter joke. It felt like a 3rd grader wrote the script. It contained every single cliché imaginable, from corny Platoon/Apocalypse Now-type one-liners to ridiculous slow-motion ""sacrifice"" scenes-- all incredibly cheap, contrived and void of any depth what-so-ever.",2017

As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong.",2017
8,"After the crushing disappointment that was Godzilla, I have to say that Kong: Skull Island is a tremendous surprise. Not only a hugely entertaining monster movie, but a well-directed, well-written and well-acted film full of ideas from start to finish. Its action set- pieces are utterly spectacular, the CGI is fantastic, and there's even a story that's genuinely interesting throughout, something that I definitely didn't expect going in.",2017

8,"As a period piece, I loved the nostalgic Vietnam War setting and the panoramic nights scenes of Saigon that they managed to weave into the film. The plot was pretty formula and characters predictable down to the frustrated Army Lt with nothing to return home to longing for one more battle. The one thing I wasn't expecting was a colder, more emotionally uninvolved ""Fay Rae"" who neither falls in love with the big ape or seems too concerned overt what happens to him one way or the other. And then finally, when he saves her life for the last time, we watch the lonely beast slowly lumber away back to his isolated oblivion while our beautiful little ingrate turns and hugs her boyfriend. Sorry but that last scene was begging to be re-shot. All in all, it's still a good flick.",2017
6,"The mighty majestic mountains that line the world. These monolithic displays of nature are icons for so many forms of expression such as poetry, video game stages, and yes even movies. Such symbolism is perfect to craft such an obstruction for heroes to face, all while teaching valuable lessons. And thus leads me to my next review, on a movie that centers on the immobile giants that watch over the world. The Mountain Between Us is the name of the film and its trailers have certainly stirred up a storm in the world of reviews. Robbie K here hoping to guide you through the mess to help guide your viewing pleasures. ",2017

5,"Some films have left me speechless. Not simply because their execution was unlike anything I've seen in the past, or opened my eyes to a story so insane thinking someone came up with this idea, but speechless cause there's so little to say about it as the film doesn't ask any new or interesting questions. The Mountain Between Us is that kind of film despite having 2 very talented actors I respect in this romantic drama.",2017
5,"Not a totally horrible movie, but not great. I can't say much more than has already been said, but there were some errors the size of a Mack truck in this movie that have not been pointed out.",2017
9,"I was very excited to hear about this movie and made it the date night movie for the week. For those calling this a slow movie, it is that because this is a character piece, not an action film. This is not even about romance to me, but more how in a bad situation two people find out who they really are and overcome their fears. These fears are not about the snow, FYI. The director does not spoon feed the plot to you, he expects you to be intelligent enough to get it. Both actors did an amazing job of emoting with their body language and facial expressions. I do not think the other proposed actors could have pulled off this nuanced performance",2017
3,When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediately turned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on this site.,2017
8,"Two strangers meet under unusual circumstances. This movie is beautifully acted and filmed. I think the casting for this was perfect and makes the movie work really well. Some may complain about the pacing of the film, that is one of the things I enjoyed most about the film. It gives you a chance to settle into the movie and get to know the characters, without being bored. The characters are different and their differences are well played out and described, then you see a shift and this is what makes this a really really good movie and a remarkable love story.",2017
3,"I think we've been pretty spoiled with great survival movies in recent years. 127 Hours, Gravity, The Revenant, Lone Survivor, or even Mad Max have given us a keen sense of a perilous journey with an emotionally satisfying finale. It seems like we get a great one every year, but The Mountain Between Us just the opposite. It uses the setting and climate to produce cheap drama and dialogue that feels like something out of a lifetime movie. With award winning actors in Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, it's hard to believe that there's little chemistry between the two. But I guess that's what happens when the script is poorly constructed.",2017
10,"Rarely do I find myself so moved by a movie. So I was pleasantly surprised. This movie offered a lot for adults that enjoy great acting, amazing cinematography, and scripts that make us think about what it means to live, love, fear, and overcome the seemingly impossible. I found myself mesmerized by the chemistry between the two main characters and how they experienced different feelings while being present in the exact same circumstance. It's an incredibly compelling story. I don't think a love story of this kind has ever been made. As far as the bad reviews go, I'm convinced that most of the people writing bad reviews and giving low ratings, NEVER saw the movie and have an agenda. Do you remember how people reacted to the infamous interracial Cheerios commercial? Well the same thing is happening here. The truth is that the movie is excellent and should be nominated for Best Picture. I'd even see it again. The ending is one of the best I have seen.",2017
1,"This ridiculous film was unmistakingly one of the worst films i've seen in 30 years! Kate Winslett needs to return to acting school, she just isn't very convincing. Here are these two souls who end up in the snowy, blizzard mountains due to a plane crash and never once did i hear either of them say ""I'm cold"". They prance thru the snow so easily and of course as time goes on they began to give each other goo goo gah gah looks like teenage heart throbs. It appears it's extremely cold yet they can hardly wait to jump in the sack. I could hardly wait for this Clunker to be finished. PLease do not waste your time on this film....it's absolutely horrible!",2017
8,It is a beautifully filmed movie with actors who really can act. I found it enthralling and inspiring. A tough movie to make with all that snow and ice. Well done Kate and Idris for creating something that felt real and convincing with a dog who helped and who also had to wander through snow and ice.,2017
1,"This would have to be one of the worst movies I think I have ever seen !!!! Especially notable for its bad acting, terrible plot/story line. I think the dog played a better part than either Kate or Idris! and I used to be a fan of both. Very sad really. Not even the cinematography could salvage this production.",2017
8,"Although it is quite predictable, i must say this was a quite nice afternoon movie. I hadn't any expectations, but i wasn't bored. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, are they going to make it?",2017
10,"Nothing like a fight for survival under extreme conditions to bring two very different characters (and actors) together. Elba and Winslet were phenomenal! It is a testament to an excellent script, superb actors and a commitment for all involved to have produced this moving love story. ""The Mountain Between Us"" was beautifully balanced between the growing love of Ben and Alex and the suspenseful action necessary for their harrowing circumstances. What an epic tale told against the most beautiful (and treacherous) backdrop imaginable! It is well worth seeing in the theaters.",2017
4,A survival romantic film about two plane crash survivors that have to find their way home in the snowy mountains could have been a whole lot better. The Mountain Between Us lacks in about everything from character developments to even making the characters interesting. The thrills of surviving was very dull in the movie. And the last half of the film spending it with the two leads following in love with each other was just terrible. ,2017
1,"Once again black male white girl... Come On Hollywood! enough is enough... instead of sending ""messages"" like this one, Hollywood should take care of making good films. The Mountain Between Us is so predictable, acting by Idris Elba and Kate Winslet is weak and even picture, in a movie filmed between mountains, is not relevant. In summary, poor script for a very stupid film. Not recommended!",2017
10,"There has been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I really don't understand why. In my opinion, this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's for everybody. There's action, drama, adventure, romance, and more. The film was emotional, and was exciting to watch. When Ben was sliding down the mountain and nearly died, or when Alex leaves the plane to go for what she believes, all was interesting to watch. Don't listen to the bad reviews. The only thing about the movie was the beginning was a little fast paced, but the rest was fabulous. I recommend this movie.",2017

It's so original. A love story for the history books. I would definitely recommend this & might even go see it again! Cheers to the director, Kate & Idris.",2017
3,"I suppose one goes to the cinema with the anticipation that ones disbelief will need to be switched off, at least for some aspects of the story. But here we asked to believe that two people and a dog survive a major air crash in the Rocky Mountains in January. The crash is graphic in its detail that, somehow, first the tail is knocked off, then a wing, before the remains slide to a halt on a convenient plateau, with petrol dripping from somewhere. I'm afraid that lazy direction pervades the film throughout, with countless more examples at every feeble plot twist. Nothing is too difficult, everything easily achieved, we are left wondering why we should bother watching to the end as, clearly, the three will make it home, overcoming the slight and predictable odds against them on the way. There was one dismally artificial twist just before redemption, involving a bear-trap, that highlighted the desperation of the writers and director to inject a little tension. The only actor that was not sleepwalking through the film was the dog(s), Beau Bridges cameo at the start was just bad, and it went downhill from there. There was no tension or chemistry between Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, the script and direction gave them no leads as to how to ramp up their dynamic. They might just as well have been cardboard cut-outs set up in front of the truly magnificent scenery. I went hoping to have an evening's entertainment in the company of two great actors, sadly they were on part throttle and the director had his foot firmly on the brake.",2017
6,After seeing the movie my first reaction is unnecessarily too large...too monotonous....too less active...and a lot of too negative aspects ....,2017
7,"There was only six of us in the theater, and the other five didn't check their cell phones during the movie, so nice to enjoy a film without distractions! This is a pretty well made movie with two superb actors - Kate Winslet and Idris Elba. I've enjoyed watching Elba in action movies, and he did quite well here in a dramatic role. It's a story of survival and romance, both a physical and emotional ordeal. The pace wasn't fast, but didn't need to be for this story. I enjoyed this movie!",2017

I saw the trailer I would say that every single moment is true moment from many other LGBT. It comes from a real life.",2018

10,"Fantastic film. But not as sexual as the advertisements promised. In fact, apart from the curse words, this film should be rated PG-13 at best. I found it surprisingly chaste.",2017
8,"With some exception, Hollywood pretty much makes two distinct kinds of biopics. The first kind are the ones that almost seem obligatory – your Gandhi's (1982), your Lincoln's (2012) and the upcoming Darkest Hour (2017); movies about historical giants who did truly incredible things with their lives, incredible things that should be projected (and even embellished) on the silver screen for the world to see. Then there are the ones about the others – your oddballs, your misfits – the characters that history books often ignore but are nevertheless important in the way our world is shaped.",2017
7,"I had a feeling that the title was propaganda to get me into the seats. After all, Wonder Woman was one of 2017's best pictures, so I figure the title of this movie (as well as the well done poster) was a way to get butts into the seats. Not that I want my money back, cause it was an excellent movie. It was lots of fun and it made me chuckle a lot of times, but if your here because you want to learn more about Wonder Woman, the movie is not designed like that specifically. ",2017
3,"If the intended purpose of ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Women"" is to illustrate the persecution of an American visionary for his family's unconventional lifestyle, the movie is a failure. The picture can be interpreted that way, but only if the viewer sort of squints and turns his head sideways, just so.",2017
9,"If we start comparing this with our normal lives, it will just blow our minds, it will even make us hate the sinning examples portrayed in the movie. We are the sum of our experiences though, and we all hate to be hated. From this point, i admire the protagonists courage because, we like it or not, we are pure sexual beings. With that in mind, i welcome and give a big thumbs up of approval to this wonderful movie, go and see it, it will change your heart and mind equally. 9* out of 10!",2018
8,"Powerful script crafted into a beautiful movie that I liked very much. My only grievance is that the Director chose not to portray all three legs of the tripod in the same light and hence the movie comes across as another romantic movie instead of showing how tantalizingly tumultuous polyamorous relationships are. They are so much more than two human beings of any sex being attracted to each other. Two plus one becomes four or five or so much more but certainly not three. One minute of the scene in a similar vein in House of Cards captures that passion more so than I could locate anywhere in this movie. Hall played her role perfectly and seemed natural in a triad. While this was a missed opportunity, I am glad this movie was made and an interesting story was shared and for that I am very thankful to TIFF and the Director.",2017
1,"Even if they like it, like Joy Mangano liked the fictional movie about herself. None of the stuff in it actually happened to Joy. She was a huge hit right off the bat, so 3/4's of the movie has her struggling with added dramatic BS! In her very first appearance she sold more product than anybody in history! I also hated Cobb, which took all sorts of poetic license with Cobbs reputation, and was written by a guy Al Stump, who really, really was a back stabbing scoundrel, just go to a sports memorabilia show and start throwing his name around and prepare to get screamed at by the tens of thousands of people Al Stump screwed over with fake stuff! Here's the problem, they make a false, fake movie, idiots think it's gospel. Cobb was an Archie Bunker type, who lived in a time when black people couldn't drink out of the same fountains as white people! People know about his opinions because he was by far the biggest star baseball player when he lived, so he was interviewed constantly. The movie literally made it seem like he was the only person with racism in the 50's. And also made it seem a guy confined to a wheelchair was running around doing all sorts of crazy stuff 6 months before he died.",2017
1,Considering the cost of seeing a movie today - this one would probably be better off viewed if checked out (for free) from the library.,2017
7,"First, I must confess that I am little acquainted with the Wonder Woman comic books. I loved the Wonder Woman series with Lynda Carter and I absolutely loved and am obsessed with the movie starring Gal Gadot. I watched this movie at once because I was curious about the background of the comic book author and because it stars two actors I really admire, Luke Evans and Rebecca Hall. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The pacing was right, I felt, for the story. I loved how the story was about him but the main focus was always, rightly so, on the two amazing and powerful women who shaped Wonder Woman as much as they influence and shaped the man who created the character from what he saw as the best of both women. The nudity/love scenes in this movie were not graphic and were done, again, my opinion, tastefully and with reverence to the story. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I loved Wonder Woman before, I now understand why.",2017
9,"I propose for every self proclaimed proponent of freedom to watch this movie and then afterward to search their souls if they are still in the same belief system. You can imagine there would be some societal backlash if three consenting adults would engage in a love triangle and in the process lay the foundation for a popular comic series that at its heart attempts to redefine femininity based on an insightful psychological theory on the relationships between men and women of which they are their own research subjects. Since that is what you are going to get. It's done mostly quite elegantly and if you're not overly puritan you may even be persuaded to conclude ""why not"". But even for those for whom these sort of relationships are not their piece of cake this is at least a piece of history that is quite remarkable. One of the best movies I've seen that while it avoids being really pornographic at the same time is capable to arouse a pleasurable erotic tension, all in the name of balanced drama being totally defensible. I liked it and I applaud anyone involved for the courage to shoot it.",2018
8,"Wonder Woman was a hit as a comic book in the past and recently a hit at cinemas around the world, so if this story was going to hit the mainstream, it only makes sense that now's the time. It seems as though more and more true stories are being made into films, and this may just be for me personally, but unique and original films seem to be dwindling down and more sequels and remakes taking their place. I believe that filmmakers choose to make true stories nowadays because the lack of original or interesting content is hard to come by, so things that have happened out in the real world seems like a safe bet that people will find enjoyable, for the most part. Quite frankly, I just thought Wonder Woman was made by a man who liked superheroes, but there's much more to it than that. If you wish to be intrigued by a story that's consistently surprising, then Professor Marston and the Wonder Women may just be the film for you.",2018
1,"The rules say that I can't a rating of less than 1 so that is what I gave it. I will not review a movie that i have not watched from start to finish. It was difficult to get through this mess, but I did. I am thankful that I did not have to pay a dime to see it. I found the subject matter of this movie to be a bit like soft Porn. I call understand why William Marston's family would have nothing to do with the making of this movie. The person who wrote this story claims that it is based on a true story. Doing some research says that she didn't even know the true story. The fact that they allow this kind of crap in theaters is just how Hollywood operates. Some reviewers gave this a 10 and called it a great movie. Everyone has to watch it and make up their own mind. Good luck with this one.",2018
1,"So you make a movie about some non-fictional people and you mostly make the most stuff up... 
On top a boring movie with some ""soft-porn"" and ""bondage"" scenes... Ah, I almost forgot, wasn't there something lately called Fifty Shades of Whatever!?
And a story about a ménage à trois. How provocative - ho ho ho. 
And you young people just google something like pulp-magazines of the 40s and have a look at all those cover artworks... ",2018
4,"Rebecca Hall has done too many American movies. Her natural British accent is butchered. She already hammers every word when she acts, over emphasizing them, now she sounds stupider with a half British/half american accent. She can't use the F word convincingly. Couldn't concentrate on the movie. From what I could tell, the dialogue was baloney anyways.
Luke Evans is great, in everything else. So-so American accent.
Adds nothing to the Wonder Woman myth.

7,"I saw ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Women"", starring Luke Evans- The Fast & the Furious movies, Clash of the Titans_2010; Rebecca Hall- Iron Man 3, The Prestige; Bella Heathcote-Fifty Shades Darker, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Connie Britton-Nashville_tv, A Nightmare on Elm Street_2010. This is based on a true story about the man that created the comic book hero, Wonder Woman, in 1941. If you know me, you know that I know a little bit about comics so I did know some of the facts in the movie, but not all of them. Luke plays William Moulton Marston, a psychology professor at Harvard that was studying human emotions and had theories about dominance & submission in relationships. He came up with what he called the DISC theory-Dominance, Inducement, Submission & Compliance-which he said was the basis of all relationships. He was a feminist and besides being married to Rebecca, he also had a female student, Bella, that he & his wife became lovers with. Oh yeah, he invented the lie detector machine, which he incorporated into his comic book creation-remember Wonder Woman's magic lasso of truth? He took different characteristics from Rebecca & Bella to use in creating Wonder Woman and also had children with both women but he did receive some resistance to the sexual connotations that he slipped into the comics-there was a lot of light bondage portrayed in his books. Connie plays the head of the children's group that did not think his Wonder Woman book was suitable for the young readers and her interviews with Luke are shown throughout the movie. If you are a comic fan like me, you will probably enjoy it a little more than the average viewer-or if you are into role playing &/or bondage. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. It's not for everyone but I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",2017
9,"The challenging---yet ultimately satisfying---approach of ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Women"", is that it isn't about any one thing, it's about several things (at least 3).",2017
7,I really do love Wonder Woman. She is probably my favorite superhero. I love the 70s TV show with Lynda Carter and the recent film. So I was definitely hyped to see the inspiration for the creation of such an iconic character. The trailer immediately had me intrigued. An unconventional and BDSM filled relationship being the inspiration for Wonder Woman? Very exciting prospect. I did like the film though the film is more engaging in some aspects and draining in others.,2017
8,"Most who follow entertainment and history knew that psych professor William Moulton Marston was the one who invented the lie detector test and created the Wonder Women character. This film sheds light on the history and the behind the scenes journey and struggles of how that came about. William a professor began working and doing research on how emotions can effect truth, health, and feeling and for many of these test his duo to work with were his wife Elizabeth and mistress and young student Olive. And along the way the work gave insight to women and the gender roles and reactions of mixed pain, pleasure, and truth seeking would make them out to be special. All of it would be tied to dominance, compliance, and feel good free will and at the time most of this shocked most of the culture. Yet still this would spark personal freedom for not just women but all in the form of sexual freedom, and outspoken rights as it was nice to see how these touch and go topics became the background and under work that helped create a national treasure and icon like ""Wonder Woman"". Really this is a great informative historical film to see worth your time to explore topics like sexual freedom, outspoken women's rights and hope and freedom for all to open up to all generations.",2017

It was awful! The CGI and auto-tuning were distracting and poorly done. On the subject of auto-tune- why did they insist Emma Watson do her own vocals when she clearly wasn't up to the task? Several other numbers, notably ""Gaston"" and ""Be our Guest"" fell flat. None of the charm or warmth of the original.",2017

2,"I had the opportunity to watch this movie today and man it was disappointing. It was boring. reason being perhaps that it felt like the copy of the original. These were the great cartoons which we grew up watching. But why would the same songs, characters, story be entertaining for us, we could just watch the cartoons again, why bother to remake. It might have been entertaining if characters were a little believable at least. The beast lack any emotion. Emma Watson (though I love her) was just trying to copy belle from the cartoons. She wasn't even given a chance to try to portray the character of belle and not the 'acting' of cartoon belle (she wasn't even successful in that). The only person I liked in the movie was Gaston. The rest of the characters were soooo animated that it stole the real feel of the movie which should really be the purpose of remaking a movie after all. A few new songs were added which were quite boring. The village of belle was aweeeefuulllll. Why Why Why would they make a village which just look like a ground full of hideous people. Why not put a little more money in that part. The reason of the movie should be to give a real life feeling to fairy tales ( which jungle book and Cinderella gave), not to just make it more cartoonish.",2017
2,"Once again I was convinced that Hollywood is dead. First of all, main the Beast and the Beast auditory are kids and teenagers from age 6 to age 18. So no big expectation for adult auditory. It is not supposed to be masterpiece of all times. But even so... how you could misrepresent historical facts like that? Medieval France. What we see? Black people lived freely among white people, they dance happily together and drink in one bar. I understand things about political correctness. But don't you think it makes movie look fake and misrepresent original fairy tale. ",2017

1,To start Disney come on the casting choices were not good. The movie does not do justice to the original and i would imagine Walt in turning in his grave. The CGI was HORRIBLE and i mean Absolutely Terrible. the worst part is in my opinion this hurts the original because it may turn younger people away that haven't see the original animated version and that is the one worth watching. I understand it will still make a ton of money but that is not do to the content because it Garbage!,2017
2,"I think the problem with Disney live-action remakes, is that there's such awkwardness in the layout, I personally felt that in the case of Beauty and the Beast, the live-action version can't ""perform"" the story very well, it appears to me that they are trying to tell the story with a fusion that combines animation, movie and musical, a bit of everything in everywhere, however I don't really enjoy this experience. The actors and actresses were fine considering the demands and preference of the audiences (consumers), some of them did very well, Like Gaston and LeFou. I think that Emma Watson looks very pretty on screen as Belle, and her singing is okay, but I personally felt that her acting is very stiff, her singing skills is very much not enough for a musical. She is a very successful and smart celebrity, I think she is a very good fashion and makeup model too, but her performances (including Harry Potter, etc) on screen I've seen so far, haven't appear to me as a professional/convincing actress at all, I never seen her looking like she is doing (performing, acting) something she believes. As Belle Emma Watson sometimes looks miserable, like she is forcing her face to hold on expression(disgusted, love, sad, etc.) that she was told to. I felt that my money spent on the movie ticket was burned watching her performance, and this isn't the first time at all when it comes to movies that has her in the cast, I remember feeling really angry last time when I saw her performance in Harry Potter- The Goblet of Fire, because I can't believe I spent money to get to watch such unprofessional performance of a pretty ""actress"" like her on a mainstream movie, and now in B&TB she hasn't improve at all. ",2017
2,"Like all Disney fans from the 80's to present, I found myself excited to see this live action adaptation once I saw the teaser poster! I decided to ignore the naysaying that followed with the trailers, and the wave of immoral rhetoric being associated with the sexuality of LeFou. (Rolls eyes) ",2017
2,"I don't know where to begin. beauty and the beast Had so much potential to be an extraordinary movie. THe village set was disappointing, everything in the movie looked fake. The beast looked like a plastic mask, the wolves I can't even begin to say. I'm honestly just disappointed in the movie. Only part I truly enjoy was the ""be our guest"" performance. honestly should've left this movie alone. It made me feel like I was watching those teen vampire movies( which I don't watch).",2017
1,"2 words: Terrible & Waste of money. How on earth does this movie even get 7.8!:score seriously!!!??? I found the French movie "" Beauty and the Beast "" released in 2014 ten times better than this!! As a parent, I though I was the only one, but my 4 year old who loves to listen to this story when I read it to her was so bored .. that she asked"" is this movie finished yet""??? ",2017
2,"Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK, but it failed to ever ""sweep you away"" like the animated version did for years. ",2017
2,"I've seen the original more times than I can count so I was very excited when I heard about a live action version that sticks to the original movie. While they did stick to the original for a good portion, they changed many of the most iconic scenes and not in a good way. For example, they cut out the scene where Belle's father first encounters the beast by the fireplace, which is my son's favorite, and replaced it with something far less interesting. They also managed, and I don't know how, to ruin the music. All of the songs are slowed down so much that it's hard to care about them and they're lacking the booming vocals that made the originals so good. They also added a lot of unnecessary dialogue which makes for a much slower pace. Overall all this movie just lacks the character of the original. We were so bored that we actually left about half way through.",2017
1,"Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beast was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim Carrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorly executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting, because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is by far the worst remake of an animated classic.",2017
1,"If it were in a theater rather than a cinema, it would have been great.",2017
2,"This movie is very overrated and the reason why the film is popular because of its promotion. Emma Watson performance is really boring as hell and her voice is not that good. I suggest you to watch the original version (1991). Dan Stevens and Luke Evans performance is pretty good tho. Overall, its the worst Disney film i've ever watched.",2017
2,"The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless and spiritless. I do appreciate that they didn't want to change the story much and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie was slightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don't really make sense and don't add up.",2017
1,"I must say, Disney seems to be putting out live action movies of their successful cartoons just for the sake of putting out live action movies! I guess corporate thinking is the initial buzz will make it money on the first weekend! This is the worst of the live actions, the acting is boring, the story mundane, I do not care about the characters at all, it seems it's just made to show how cool Disney can use special effects! If you like the story, stick to the original cartoon!",2017
1,"My title says it all. Even with releasing nude photos of herself and playing it up as a 'hack' Emma Watson fails to deliver in this predictable, cliché, gyno-centric feminist's wet dream of a reboot. You'd think Hollywood would stop trying to dictate what the audience finds entertaining, but it seems nobody in Hollywood wants to make any money anymore. Maybe the film / television industry is going the way of the music industry. Maybe it should, the 'talent' has been full of themselves for far too long now.",2017
1,"Was lifeless, characters had no emotion or personality , found myself rooting for gaston, he was the only cool one. Modern autotuned garbage. CGI was awful and way overdone. Nothing like the original. Songs were long and annoying. Dialogue felt rushed like they tried to cram all the stuff from the original into it but ran out of time.",2017
1,"Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the best I have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here. This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50 minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget 160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All this musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast's daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this role. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16 years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time to see this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to get back on track this month of May.",2017
2,"All these good reviews, all the praise, my local magazine reviewed it in glowing terms and watching it last night (and I even dragged my very unwilling boyfriend too) it felt like a copy. Yes, I know you are laughing it is already a remake and yet another Beauty And The Beat, but this is so similar to the one from the 90s we have all watched that you will be sitting there asking 'what is the point?' Still, pretty sure Disney doesn't care they got two tickets out of us, but if you read this it is nothing new or different and the inclusion of a so-called gay character is so irrelevant to the story and so ungay that it makes no difference. If you have seen the multiple other Beauty And The Beasts out there (animated or not) you have seen this. Disney must be really hard up for cash. Do anything else, go out for dinner, cook for your man, let him take you in front of the window, read a book, update your keek or just unwind... you'd be ahead.",2017
1,"This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson's voice is auto- tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn't good. Each time the Beast popped up, he was very off putting. Watson's line deliveries are poor and doesn't do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast's CGI, at least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince compared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Time does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by frame copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.",2017
5,i was enjoying the series till i got to episode 9! it's full of stupid mistakes which could be avoided by a simple google search!or even watching a couple of YouTube clips ,2017
1,episode9..???...is this Iran??? are you f.u.ck.i.n.g kidding me......this is not even close to perspective of t.eh.ran and Iran......another bullshit lie about Iran...pl.s search in y.o.u.t.u.b about t.e.h.r.a.n and Iran....Iran is very beautiful and sophisticated country in the world....we have fastest and cheapest internet in the world.....best athletics in the world.... best master mind science in the world...and most i.r.a.n.i.a.n people hates Islam...yes t.h.a.s right we hate Islam because Islam ruins our 7000 years civilization....,2017
3,"""The aim of the counterfeit State of Israel, is to get the United States of America involved in a war in the Middle East""
 
 ""Both Communism and International Bankers (Zionists) have a programme for the establishment of a single World Government, the former having been financed by the latter. ""This world- wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation, and the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. And this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America, have become the undisputed masters of the world."" ",2018
3,"I wanted to like this because I enjoy the genre, but have worked in it so technical inaccuracies are tough to sit through, as is Anne Heche. (Others have made checklists of technical problems in detail in other reviews). I get why many like it - the show has a great look, the story lines are decent and the characters are filling out. But on the downside the exposition can be tedious and so can the dialogue when they see an action taking place. (We see 3 strange men cross the street and someone says, ""3 strange men just crossed the street."")",2017
2,"I really wanted to like one of this years new military shows including ""The Brave"" (NBC), ""Seal Team"" (CBS) or ""Valor"" (CW). It didn't take too long before the character ""Patricia Campbell"" played by Anne Heche to become...well...Anne Heche and all that that implies. Somehow, in the middle of the desert when trying to pry some information out of an American Taliban the big point that is going to bring him to his senses is his love for gender equality. I literally laughed right out loud. Who isn't for gender equality but that is the thing that is going to bring him to his senses? I wanted to like this show. Clearly the writers are far more interested in pushing some political agenda than creating entertainment based on a military thesis. Anne Heche as the leader of a special OPs team? Really? Could they find anyone less convincing?",2017
4,"A U.S. Army Special Forces Captain is usually in Command of a Detachment not a Group, this Detachment is not like a U.S. Army Special Forces Detachment and includes Women Operators, and Special Warfare Operators from other Branches and even Other Nations Special Warfare, usually a Detachment of a 1 or more ODAs and a ODB at U.S.A.F. Incirlik Turkey not just 5 or 6 Team Members, as part of a Larger Independent U.S. Military Joint Special Operations Task Force under the Direct Command of the U.S. President with advise from Director ODNI, not the DIA.",2017
2,"I liked this show until episode 9, I'm from Iran and when I saw this episode it was unbelievable, have too many flaws in it. For example show some views from Isfahan and main story is in Tehran, people have Terrible accent and use wrong phrases and half of them speak Arabic.WE ARE PERSIAN, not Arabs.",2017
2,"As I watched few episodes, I was quite astonished by episode two. It was about one of the main protagonists hiding in Ukraine. The problem was with the atmosphere and caricaturе Rambo-style portrayal of rebels and Russians. To begin with, people don't look there as they are from 1950s. The area doesn't look like poor version of Ukranian portion of Brighton Beach. They don't say ""Russians take things without paying"" because most of them are Russians in that region. The whole set up is completely unrealistic. Russian say what no Russian would ever say, they act totally fake. Good screenplays should be close to reality, but this one creates its own. It's OK when it does not correspond with real geographic location. But if it does and it's not true, then it's propaganda or dissemation of ignorance.",2017
4,"Yet another show about ""The Brave"". What about the slightly less brave? You know, the ones who are not so sanctimonious about it. In the end, this is another formula show about the people who help keep the world safe from democracy. A more complex view about what US intelligence really does would be appreciated.",2017
1,"OK first of all the name ""Fahim Jarif"" is not a Persian name. The airport supposedly shown as Tehran international was not like the real one a bit, as it looked like an airport in a old ass African country. and of course the biggest terrorist in the movie have to be an Iranian high ranking official. And no they don&#1575;t ask you about Quran when you are travelling to Tehran. At last but not least Farsi is not written like this --> س ق د ا ب غ ق Get it right. Tehran is not like that at all, most of the cars shown was from the 70s The city looked it was from 40 years ago. There are not military personnel in every street. Some of the writing was even in ARABIC which is not realistic at all. Liked the show before the episode 9. Episode 9 is absolutely trash and racist and not realistic.",2017
1,"This is a comedy and you should watch it as such. If you take it seriously, you will be disappointed. It plays like an infantile notion of what special-ops is like. The extremely wooden and unconvincing characters explain everything, even comment for those in the public who might miss something, like: ""That's a convoy."" or ""What's he doing?"" and lots more. This has got to be a joke. You would have to be half brain-dead to take this seriously. Unfortunately, the burlesque element is not strong enough for me.",2017
4,"this show only gets a 4 because i like the idea of it, the set, and the actors, but not the acting. once again TV takes a really good idea and turns it to crap. Heche is just awkward, she does not act like a person that would be in charge of a spec ops team, more like a frazzled kindergarten teacher and the way she talks makes her sound like she's doing her best batman impression. lot's of clichés and the stories are not original, recycled themes and ideas from past spec ops, military shows. i assume this show's intended audience is uneducated, highly imaginative mall cops, wannabe soldiers, etc... great idea, cool guns, but poorly put together. I'll be surprised if this isn't cancelled after 1 season. such a disappointment",2017
1,"This show clearly doesn't know anything about the intelligence community or the SOF community. In the opening credits, they refer two main groups of protecting the United States, and Special Forces Operators. That is an incorrect statement, because Special Forces is the name of the Green Berets, it does not refer to anybody else in the spec ops community. The term they should of used is Special Operations Force(s). Second, going back to the term ""Special Forces Operators"" is incorrect also because Special Forces(Green Beret) are not operators, only tier 1 groups like DEVGRU, Delta, JTF2 and SOG are deemed operators. Second error in the first 6 minutes, is the intelligence aspect is being handle by the DIA (Defence Intelligence Agency) yet, the call the Special Operations Group? The SOG is a CIA spec ops unit, the DIA would of called JSOC as the DIA is a part of the military. Third error, within the SOG group their is a female, the SOG is infamous for only recruiting from Tier 1 groups in the military, and no female has EVER made a tier 1 group or any SOF for that matter. Clearly a lack of detail, I turned off after these quite simple errors.",2017
6,"THE BRAVE (NBC), SEAL TEAM (CBS): I group these together because it's the same show - different casts but the same predictable plot lines, same characters - each with some kind of specialty, same trite dialogue ('You can run, but you can't hide.' They actually paid someone to write that?), same mediocre acting, same over-edited action sequences, and same female commander just like every other procedural show on TV with the possible exception of NCIS. (Before you get all bent out of shape over this, I get it. I understand the necessity for equality, but com' on! Really? I think we've reached the saturation point.) Their job is to stand in front of a slew of monitors, supposedly watching events in real time so they can spot problems and advise their teams on counter measures, all the while emoting expressions of concern during and relief after the operation is completed so they can deliver the 'Well done team. Return to base.' line, while the other members of the team in the situation room clap and congratulate each other on another successful mission. The pity is, there are some good people wasted in these: Anne Heche and Mike Vogel in The Brave, and David Boreanaz stars in Seal Team. The deserve better material than this and so do we. Neither is worth your time. Score: The Brave: 6, Seal Team: 5. I'd be very surprised it either lasts a full season.",2017
5,Others have commented about the military accuracy or lack thereof. Critique of the military aspects is outside of my knowledge base. I have a much more simplistic remark.,2017
1,"This is just the exact same type of tried scenarios that was used on ""State of Affairs"" from two seasons ago. Although maybe ""State of Affairs"" would have fared better if they had used the male lead from this boring attempt called the Brave. The only reason the Brave will see air play is because of Ellen's wife is probably backing it with her own money, but Katherine Heigl's acting is much better and definitely more range than Anne Heche.",2017
7,"It took me a couple to three episodes to get into this show and now I enjoying watching it. Yes, there's a lot of errors with technical jargon, etc but hey this is TV and most of the things they do on TV is NOT real. Remember Quick Sand in all those old tv westerns? Yeah, not so real. So you take it with a grain of salt and enjoy this show for what it is. A pretty decent way to spend an hour watching a pretty good action show. I certainly hope they renew The Brave because I have come to really enjoy watching it.",2018
10,"I don't normally take the time to write reviews (this may be my first) but after seeing several episodes of The Brave and reading several nitpicking reviews I will offer my take. This show is firstly well written, well cast (with strong roles for women - which is a big draw for me - note that I have a prejudice for gender equality), well paced and well directed. In short the producers and show runners behind this series know their craft. With any visual media you have to suspend belief in order to absorb the story so if there are minor errors made in pursuit of telling the story I am ok with that. Anne Heche is in her prime as an actor and its nice to see a vehicle that allows her to showcase her strengths but not requiring her to do the heavy lifting and carry the series - The Brave at its heart is an ensemble effort. The strong casting of the other actors and the writing makes this series stand out from several similar projects currently in production.",2018
3,"A very pretty cast that is well balanced on the diversity scale. And totally dull because of it. While presenting a show where the heroes aren't always ""on"" because they're waiting for the analysts to do their work (they are the ""tip of the spear"" as they call it) has some potential to be interesting where other shows in the genre fall short, this show fails to deliver by failing to suspend disbelief in so many other ways.",2017
3,"Full of clichés, weak writing. Plot doesn't make sense and unrealistic.",2017
5,"very stereotypical and often difficult to stomach. lot's of pep talks about how the team needs to stick together. not a whole lot of substance here, even for a military show. if i'm to equate this show to the crime genre, this is very much like ""criminal minds"". so if you're looking for something like ""true detective"", i'd suggest looking elsewhere.",2017
3,Another CSI type of show with a nerdy team directing soldiers instead of law enforcement. Unoriginal and predictable like Seal Team. What's with the beards you see in every military movie and show in the last two years. No one in Hollywood has a original thought anymore putting out and recycling the same plot lines over and over.,2017
10,"I can't believe all the negative reviews for ""The Brave"" so far. The cast is great and likable from the start. The tension is intense for the whole show. The team is heroic and Vogel is a believable leader. Seal Team is much more difficult to follow and the characters, even the lead Boreanaz, are not very likable. I hope there are more than just 6 episodes of ""The Brave"". Cast our votes as a great new show.",2017
6,"To be honest, I only watched the first two episodes. After I watched the pilot, I have no interest whatsoever and completely bored. Then forcing myself to watch another one, I'm just utterly shocked that there are people would willingly produce this stuff. If you are a true, die-hard patriot of the United States, that's cool and I'm not against you by any means. But the dialogues, characters' names (antagonists particularly), settings, and story plots are nothing but cliché. Outcomes are extremely predictable, antagonists are like retards, and everything in this show lack originality.",2017
9,"I love this show. From the pilot episode it was smart compelling TV. The team out in the field are great! Let by actor Mike Vogel, as a convincing leader, the team is filled with wonderful real characters and I like them all. The State-side team may be stilted in comparison but the field team way outweigh what they lack. The obstacles and the solutions they come up with are far better than most shows of this genre. This show is far better than the new SEAL Team show, which is flashy and much more unrealistic. Give this a chance!!",2017
3,"If you are a fan of the comics, this show is definitely not for you. Almost all the background story of each character has changed, and there are a lot of materials that do not exist on the show that reminds me of B or C rated drama shows that have been canceled after one season. None of the charms of the comic book has been incorporated. It feels like the writers just read an the outline of the story, looked at the character designs, and decided they'll make up everything else.",2017
3,"The show is geared more towards fans of Gossip Girls than fans of the Runaways comic books. Unfortunately, I fall into the latter group, so three episodes in I am disappointed. I had such high expectations for a TV series based on one of Marvel's greatest comic-book series ever! But this series clearly wasn't made for the fans. ",2017
3,"I liked this at first, then it slowed down, way down and I gave no more craps. I had to force myself to finish it. I really don't see or get the point in it. I wanted action, Marvelesque type stuff, instead I got a bunch of over aged ""teenagers"" with vocabulary of 30 year olds, that can hack multi billion dollar corporations, out smart people with money, power, powers, etc. and a totally lackluster story with zero freaking point. So please, someone explain to me how this show is good. Don't waste your time on it.",2018
2,This series is an excellent example of the importance of good screen writing. Perhaps any lesson one might wish to learn about what to avoid while adapting or creating a television series can be gleaned from the missteps found in this series.,2017
3,"So far this show just isn't engaging and I found myself getting bored throughout the first three episodes. The characters just don't feel like characters, they're very poorly fleshed out. Sure it's a diverse cast but they're not exactly diverse in attitude, all the teens act pretty much the same. We know very little about them other than how they dress and you can tell how hard they're trying to make them as inoffensive and PC as they can which really takes away the sense of fun. ",2017
9,"Honestly, not sure why some reviewers are giving this show so much flack.. so it's not exactly like the comics.. big deal. Not everything in the MCU is gonna be right down to a T. MCU has always put a little spin on their films and TV programs. People are saying this show is slow to start, I prefer that. I like learning about the characters and their backgrounds before diving into the action and suspense.",2017
4,"Instead of breaking the mold with the characters on this show runaways basically copies and pastes most of it's characters and decides that it's clearly morally wrong to give them any real nuance. From the parents who fit neat little boxes like the ultra religious types, or the angry abusive and power hungry dad with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, to the angry girl with dyed hair and an attitude that does nothing but relate everything to some sort of social agenda. It feels like Marvel decided that every character has to substitute uniqueness with box ticking. Let's appease people's desire for simplistic characters that do't challenge our perceptions at all. Like so many shows it had lots of possibility that simply fell flat",2017
5,"The show is moving at a much slower pace than the trailer suggested which I wouldn't have minded had the show been any good. Runaways is decent at best with mundane script writing and an over saturation of clichéd characters. They've introduced so many characters early on that you're almost perplexed at times as to who's who and their relation to the other characters as well as their relevance to whatever the plot is becoming. As for the plot, it tries to be too mysterious and foreboding that it only confuses itself in numerous plot holes and bad character decisions for the sake of extending the story and providing unnecessary drama.",2017
3,"What do you expect to see when you hear the word ""Marvel"" ? Colorful action, a pinch of drama, exciting characters - that comes to my mind.",2017
1,"After discovering their parents are super-villains in disguise, a group of teenagers band together to run away from their homes in order to atone for their parents' actions and to discover the secrets of their origins. Marvel's Runaways is another Teen Soap Opera TV Show where a bunch of teenagers are dancing and drinking and one day they realize that their parents aren't exactly ""saints"" and they basically run away and they also have super powers for some reason because it's cool right? If you expect this show to be great because Rotten Tomatoes said so you're gonna be disappointed because what Runaways does in the end or what it did to me at least was to bore the hell out and i could swear that like every 10 to 15 minutes there was a teen song playing in the background but what makes the show even worse is the lack of excitement and talent since none of the actors are good in doing their job or at least make me care about their characters their all the classic old teen type of character that loves music, is angry with one of the parents and above he or she has superpowers and honestly it doesn't bring anything new to the Marvel Saga or the Comic Book Era in general it's the same old thing just like Legion and Gifted was and it's just as bad as Inhumans. Overall this is a show that some people might like and others might not and i'm with the minority on this one because it was another step back for the MCU it's boring, predictable and above all it brings nothing new to the table it's something that i have seen done better in better movies and TV shows in general and i'm afraid that Marvel has started going down a path that even i can't follow at this point. (0/10)",2017
9,"This is a true light in the dark of a show! I dare you to watch 4 episodes despite all the BS in other reviews. In fact I double dare you! If you like the superhero genre, this will stand out as one of the best since season 1 of Heroes. The show demands that you pay attention, both to the subtleties in the characters, and to the in your face stunning cinematics. ",2017
1,"I have been looking forward to seeing this for what seems like forever, I'm a huge fan of the comics. With that being said, this feels like it was written by someone who doesn't know the source material. It lacks the fun of the comic book series. This review is solely based upon the first episode, I could barely get through it. The characters seem changed, moody teenagers who happen to have abilities.",2017
2,Why do marvel keep allowing these boring series to be made? They spent the entire 53 mins of the first episode showing teenage drama and off screen history for the whole pilot. ,2017
10,"Some of the characters might be a bit stereotypical, but there is enough depth to them to hold my interest. SFX are decent, if used sparingly; Rather than throwing lasers every which way, this show is relying on the writing, which is great. Given the scope of Marvel offerings out there, from several different universes (X-men, Legion, the Gifted, Agents of Shield, Netflix, etc). It is difficult for a show to hold my attention, but I am intrigued with the plot, and enamoured of the diverse and fresh-faced cast. That's another check-mark for Marvel given some of their blunders in that regard ie: Iron Man, Captain America, Ant Man, Thor, and Spider- Man ALL have minorities for sidekicks, but I digress.",2017
6,"It starts off slow and keeps at a slow pace. There is not much action but mostly teen drama. There is alot of focus on the parents so we could understand their side of the story and feel for them. Right now, I'm on episode 6 and it's starting to pick up the pace. The show still has potential for a great show so I'll keep watching!",2018
9,"This show is one of the best installments of Marvel yet. Agents of Shield is still the best Marvel has done, including the movies, and this is actually not far away from that high level of greatness. ",2017
2,"The first episode is filled with Leftist propaganda mixed with teenage debauchery and trite high school drama. It is riddled with trans-rights, anti-religious, hyper-feminist drivel. It is not, however, filled with anything resembling a likable character.",2017
8,"Runaways was my first ever comic book, Its the reason I fell in love with comics at all. I've been waiting for a runaways movie for years, and wasn't sure what to think when it was announced as a series instead, but i was hopeful. After 3 episodes I can say I still believe it would have been better adapted as a movie. The pacing is slow because they have to stretch it out, and a big budget studio would have allowed for a CGI Old Lace, which would be preferable to the puppet they're currently working with. ",2017
3,"Invested time in the first two episodes. Will not be returning. EP1 - lots of characters introduced; none are likable, none create interest in the story. EP2 - So slow I fast forwarded the first 30 min at double speed. Still kept up with the glacial story pace. Still found no reason to like any of the characters or really care if they succeed or fail. I don't see spending another 45 min to see if it improves. Writers use to know how to grab your interest in chapter 1. I think these writers assume just having 'Marvel' in the title card is enough to create interest. Nope. With series like this and ""The Gifted"" I can see why Disney is pulling all the licensing and limiting new content.",2017
2,"The bad
1- a lot of unsolved mysteries , unanswered questions to the extent that it's just tiresome to watch. to top it off, a cliffhanger finale!.
If you remember how dragging Heroes & Lost were , this one isn't interesting to know what happens next in the show 
2- nothing actually happens for 10 episodes. just some drama. cheating and love triangles. action scenes are very minimal",2018
10,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this show and do not see why. Especially when shows such as the lackluster ""The Gifted"" have emerged. I would recommend this over the 4 Netflix originals ""Iron First"" etc. Highly entertaining and intuitive. Slow start but I can see it becoming a very good show. Many expect the first episode to kick off in full gear, I would prefer to see the show set up. The cast is great and keeps me wanting more. If this show is renewed for a second and third season I can see it becoming one of my favorite marvel shows.",2017
3,"I'm going to try to keep this short, I could rant for hours about how badly this show failed.",2017
4,"Poor acting, really bad story. Boring... it's taken them 5 episodes to get exactly nowhere with the plot so far. Also.. the characters in this show are Stupid... and I do mean stupid with a capital S... characters. Seriously... Nobody is this clueless. ",2017
2,I was really disappointed in this and after two episodes found myself fast forwarding to try to find something worth watching.,2017
1,"Sad. Stupid. And with the most recent episode, with the big transitions, was it. Broken electronics and dreams on the ground. ",2017
7,Philip K Dick's stories have been shown by films like Bladerunner and Minority Report to be brilliant source material to make great screen adaptations. Black Mirror has shown how great a science fiction anthology series can be. The first two episodes of Philip K Dick's Electric Dreams hint at how great the series could be. ,2017
8,"I've read several critics' reviews comparing this show to Black Mirror as if it fails in comparison. I don't think that's accurate. Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams is visually, thematically and, most importantly, narratively interesting. What is real or normal? What makes a human? Meanwhile, there are at least 2 episodes from S4 of Black Mirror that don't measure up to what I've seen so far in Electric Dreams, and apparently I've been watching the dud episodes, per critics' reviews.",2018
5,I was really excited to watch Stan's original Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams but after watching the series I feel like they should have taken PKD's name out of the title. ,2017
9,"I'm going into this without much knowledge of Philip K Dick and the whole Black Mirrors series (and really enjoying it). I have to say I really like this show. It has interesting stories, some could probably use a little more than 50 minutes to get a better grasp at the characters and the story to really make an impact. But with how they are, they are well done. The cast is amazing, full of well known actors and actresses. The episodes were beautifully shot, so from an aesthetic stand point, it was nice to watch. The stores are interesting sci-fi, leaving me with something to think about, rather than just thinking ""well that's pretty cool."" I think if you go into this not comparing it to Black Mirrors, you will enjoy it. If you compare, you will more than likely be disappointed, well, because it's not Black Mirrors. Both shows, in my opinion, are very well done, so I won't say one is better than the other. If you love sci-fi and the Twilight Zone feel, you will like this.",2018
10,I must be very old. I have seen the first three episodes and I have loved every single one. this is what Mr dick was about. weird / strange/ and (insert own ) The acting has been great. the story telling has been great. I thought I knew Mr dicks stories.....but this has brought to me a whole new (insert) Enjoyment for the Pre-milamiums,2017
8,"There can be no denying that on first look this episode of Electric Dreams borrows heavily from the likes of Blade Runner, Black Mirror, Children of Men... etc, but of course the source material for this provides inspiration for the aforementioned titles, and so it's get an originality pass in my book. ",2017
5,"Great atmosphere & good acting. The only regrettable thing is that they could have chosen a much more interesting short story to film but anyway it's certainly not regrettable that this picture exists. I can't believe the review where the person says PKD is a so-so author. I guess either he is lobotomized or just likes space soaps. Waiting for the next episodes! Edit: I had to remove 5 stars after my initial euphoria not because the series is bad but because it is badly represented. this is not Philip dick. in most episodes so far the interpretation wildly misses the point of the source material and is often transformed beyond recognition. the production is great actors, plots etc and i would give it a high rating if it didn't parade with the name of Philip dick. it's like saying the matrix or dark city is based on Philip dick sure they resemble his style and philosophy but it is not something he has written. still the series is worth watching if you know this from the start: not ""Philip k. dick's electric dreams"" but ""electric dreams inspired by Philip dick""",2017
6,"The first episode reminded me, like others here, of Brazil, mostly because of the female main character, who has a (not so small) resemblance to 'Jill'. The story is quite interesting, though the topic itself is somewhat outworn. But there simply isn't enough time (or too slow pacing) to convincingly elaborate a multifarious story and setting, it's only a snapshot of a world where oppressed and demeaned ""telepaths"" (called ""Tees"", would you believe that ?) are beginning to revolt, when the public anger against them and their abilities is also raising to dangerous levels, and when the government seems to be (deliberately ?) helpless.",2017
8,"I'm not familiar with the short story the pilot episode (The Hood Maker) is based upon but it convinced me, or the writer did a solid job adapting it. It builds a world that reminded me of the Terry Gilliam Brazil with the dirt, chaos and stymied technology. Yet, as it's learned in the end, it's not not our world. This was surely added by the writer and it isn't a twist really, but it functions nicely. Comparing it to similar movies, we mustn't forget that this has only 45 or so minutes to depict a world and resolve a story. It builds a fine atmosphere and keeps it steady throughout.",2017
7,"I'm not familiar with Philip K Dick's work although his writing has always intrigued me, especially when I think of the several movie adaptations of his work, from the obvious ""Blade Runner"" to ""Total Recall"", ""Minority Report"" and others.",2017
2,Really thoroughly disappointed in the first episode of this series.,2017
8,The Hood Maker was an episode inspired by - but very different to - the short story by Phillip K Dick but the world created on the screen was one I recognized from both Blade Runner and the many short stories Dick wrote from the 1950s onward.,2017
4,"Being a huge fan of Black Mirror, I was excited to watch Electric Dreams after seeing the trailer, unfortunately after episode 1 I was slightly bemused and rather disappointed.",2017
3,"The trailer for this series is the much better than the episodes I've seen so far. Episode 1 the Hood Maker was quite good, with a coherent plot although not particularly strong characters. Having watched 3 more episodes I can see now they started with their best offering before foisting on us an underwhelming mess...lead characters with unapparent motivations, under-explained future societies, a scatter-gun approach to employing philosophical concepts. With the likes on Spall, Cranston and Buscemi on board I was sure this would be great, but the writers have failed to translate Dicks stories in a way that is remotely engaging. I'm stopping at episode 4.",2017
4,"I've watched the first 4 in the series and won't be watching any more. The whole experience is decidedly underwhelming and none of the stories felt completely finished or 'ready' for production. An anthology series very similar to 'Black Mirror' which coincidentally has very similar issues with its own production. Maybe its a UK industry problem that doesn't cope well with the quality and competence in production, but it's and odd similarity to share. ",2017
5,"Black Mirror has seriously raised the bar for quality as far as sci-fi anthologies go, and I'm sad to say that the first 4 episodes of Electric Dreams are several notches below that in every regard. I was expecting more in terms of production values, storyline, etc. etc.",2017
2,"Some shows deal with mundane topics but, through acting or storytelling or visuals or whatever, leave a impression, and some scenes pop up in your head months or years after you've seen them.",2017
10,"The first episode of Electric Dream ""The Hood Maker"" is a great thought provoking start to this ""classic in the making"" anthology series. From the open shot that pays homage to Tarkovsky's Solaris, to the ""beauty in the ugliness"" of the world created, the world-building never stops. For a program that lasts 50 minutes, there is a extremely dense personal and political dystopia developed, that is both familiar (racism, police states, immigration) and very distance and all typical of Dick's otherworldly narrative styling and quasi-reality. This is one of the best sci-fi offering since the first two season of Black Mirror (the Third season on Netflix dropped in quality) and I can only hope that this standard of quality continues.",2017
3,I've watched the first 3 episodes so far and have been massively underwhelmed.,2017
6,Just watched the first episode and what can i say but dull dull dull.,2017
3,"I presume this series was produced on the back of the hugely impressive 'Black Mirror'. Considering the money that's clearly gone into it, the series is incredibly weak. Four episodes in, and all but 'the commuter' have proved to be fairly rambling, uninspiring pieces. They're like Dr Who episodes minus the charm and imagination. God knows if they're faithful to the original short stories, but in the end, I suppose it makes no difference.",2017
1,"We have started watching these series with my husband expecting something amazing, similar to Black Mirror (as it was advertised)... My husband only watched 2 episodes and refused to continue. I have tried another 2. Will stop now for sure. Feels like you have to actually read the stories before watching the series, otherwise anything that is presented to the viewer is not clear, nothing what is happening makes sense... We are HUGE fans of sci-fi, and my husband likes P.K. Dick's books. But Electric Dreams TV-series are simply bad....",2017
10,"There's been a surge of Speculative Fiction-Scifi Anthology productions as of late... Between Amazon's ""Electric Dreams"", Netflix's ""Black Mirror"", ""The Man in the High Castle,"" ""The Zero Hour,"" ""Dark"" and others there has been a broad range of opinions as to the quality of these latest additions to the genre lorded over by revered kings like TWILIGHT ZONE AND OUTER LIMITS...Some examples offer simplistic and raunchy popcorn copies of the genre kings that too often fail miserably to engage the intelligence of cult followers of Speculative Fiction. A prime example of a series being wildly erratic in this guilt is The BLACK MIRROR...As such, I find Electric Dreams the most satisfactory and intellectually engaging production presently...It absolutely reeks of substantial adherence to the original credos prevalent in both the highest traditions of the genre and its legendary SciFi Author Phillip K. Dick.",2018

10,I was born in 1974 so now I am 43 and the Woody Woodpecker Show was one of my favorite cartoons growing up. Needless to say I loved this movie. Woody Woodpecker was just as funny and crazy in this movie as he was in the show. I seen some of the review and they were negative but those a bit younger than me especially millennials don't know what good child friendly entertainment is & simply don't appreciate it especially since they are always stuck on their smart phones and computers. Nobody really watches cartoons much less plays outside anymore. I notice the only children I have seen watching cartoons is babies and toddlers maybe up to 5 years old give or take. I wish and hope they would make a Mighty Mouse movie too as well. These child friendly cartoons back then were really good for children and taught children how to be the good guy and that it was better to be the good guy.,2018
9,Woody Woodpecker was a beloved cartoon for many. It was a mainstay of weekday cartoons for many New Yorkers and Americans in the 90's.,2018
1,The hyperactive red-headed bird enters a turf war with a big city lawyer wanting to tear down his home in an effort to build a house to flip. The Trailer for Woody Woodpecker was so bad that i couldn't even finish it and the same goes for the film. Just from the opening scene i knew that this movie was going to be the end of me there's literally a chocolate joke that feels like it was made back in 2002 and believe me the cgi does look like that. Woody looks and sounds awful and as for the rest of the Cast their terrible as well and please if you love your kids don't make them watch this abomination better show them the early 00's cartoon which was enjoyable in many aspects than this was. (0/10),2018
1,"Bad emotion of every actor and actress. Bad script. My kid watched it with flat expression, even when the movie try to make us laugh. Hopefully there's another woody woodpecker better movie next time.",2018
3,"Yes, this is happening. Alex Zamm directs this live-action/CGI film wrapped around that once very popular character created by Walter Lantz...Woody Woodpecker. A big city lawyer Lance Walters (Timothy Omundson) comes across as a self-centered con artist that wants to tear down a piece of the forest to build a dream home. Not for him and his uppity girlfriend Brittany (Thaila Ayala) to live in; but to flip it for a fortune. Walters also is trying to bond with his estranged son (Graham Verchere). ",2018
8,"As someone who grew up loving Woody, I was thrilled to find something I could enjoy with my 1st grader. My son knew of Woody Woodpecker, but didn't get into it so much - until this movie. He loves Woody's antics. I can't get enough of the film location. Just gorgeous! Overall I think the movie stayed true to the character we grew up with. A good movie for family night.",2018
1,"A film without grace and without a well-executed script, an unfortunate montage, a flat photography, nothing innovative, nothing fun and completely a waste in something that many of us who grew up watching the cartoon would have enjoyed if the right decisions had been made, starting with-how the movie was made, and having a better direction.",2018
1,"The ONLY joke appears in the cast list. The father's name is Lance Walters, a play on Walter Lantz, the creator of Woody Woodpecker. 
I paid $1100 for my ticket, but it did come with a flight to Rio. I should have slept.
The movie is another fine example of why offering tax credits for making movies is immoral. I feel, as a Canadian taxpayer, as if I personally approved the production of this movie. I didn't. Woody Woodpecker is apparently (and inexplicably) popular in Brazil, to whom this movie is targeted. 
I used to watch Woody Woodpecker reruns as a college student. They were a source of ironic laughs because they were pretty crappy ripoffs of Bugs Bunny, but with a singularly unappealing lead character. Where Bugs was a jerk to people who imposed on him, defending his turf from people who wanted to pave over his rabbit hole or eat him or shoot him or whatever, Woody was just a jerk.
This movie gives him a sympathetic cause with a green environmentalist tinge, but it is bereft of any creativity. There is the troubled father son relationship, the bullied kid, every cliche you could possibly imagine. And Woody? He does fart and poop jokes, because the people responsible have no ability to come up with anything the slightest bit interesting. It would be as offensive a treatment of a beloved childhood character as what Jim Carrey did to the Grinch or Mike Meyers did to the Cat in the Hat, except for the fact that the original Woody was never beloved. He was just a jerk. So who cares? Well, the taxpayers of Canada should.",2018
7,"This movie seemed like a lower budget film, but it has a environmentally conscious theme. Some of the movie felt borrowed from other movies, as if the writers were having a slow day. Regardless of the lack of luster, Woody the Woodpecker was certainly good enough to capture the imagination of children. If anything the movie makers should have gone full digital for this cartoon reboot, Woody would look fantastic in a fully rendered scene coupled with characters that match the artistic style; imagine if the Captain Underpants movie was done in real life, I don't think Nick Kroll would make a very good Professor Poopypants without some major editing.",2018
10,"Another reviewer here asks a very pertinent question as to why this film is not better known. If you watched this and didn't enjoy it then I reckon you must be dead. First off, the acting is superb. I'm not one for American child actors. They are often bizarrely moppet-like and unappealing, but this child is absolutely marvelous. She steals every scene she's in, and, like her uncle, Frank, I just sat back and wondered at her charm. Chris Evans does a fantastic job with this role. He plays it understated, which works incredibly well. There are some genuinely funny moments--I particularly liked the one-eyed cat, Fred, and his rescue from the (euthanasia) shelter. He's just sitting there with two other cats waiting to be put down. No one dies on Frank's watch. Great acting, interesting plot, genuine emotion, questions about the meaning of life and the debt we owe to our talents, all wrapped up in a great-looking movie. Just watch. You'll love it.",2017
9,"I knew nothing about this film. Had seen no adds, heard no word of mouth, pretty much nothing. ",2017
9,"Yes, I give this a 9 out of 10. Not because it's a blockbuster (actually I don't know if it is, or not, and I don't care.) or because of any hype. (I've watched it by pure chance.) ",2017
9,Great movie to watch. I loved the chemistry between Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. Something to watch out. The direction is great and the story very much moving. ,2017
10,"Screenwriter Tom Flynn offers a well-considered and genuinely moving story about how we deal with gifted children – and adults. GIFTED is also about family connections and the impact on children whose parents are lost to them by separation whether in death by natural causes, by suicide, or by desertion. Marc Webb who has gathered an impeccable cast to enact this touching drama directs his sensitive story with aplomb.",2017
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. The ""right"" choice isn't always obvious. Things get more complicated when even the ""best"" choice isn't clear. Place a young child at the heart of that decision tree, and the result may yield emotional turmoil and an abundance of moral high ground and judgment. Such best intentions are at the core of this latest from director Marc Webb (his first feature since 500 Days of Summer) and writer Tom Flynn.",2017
8,"Gifted is a story with not a lot of surprise elements, but it wins the audience over with its powerful statement, outstanding acting and stunning cinematography. Mainly, Gifted has a very dramatic story line. However, Gifted offers much more then that. Viewers also get a subplot of romance, friendship and strong family values as well as some comedy here and there to keep a dramatic movie light.",2017
10,"Great show, held my attention and warmed my heart! This is not an action, shoot em up show. Just a little cursing. No nudity. Just the presentation of a dilemma of life and the love for a growing, young girl. Excellent acting and filming. The best movie I've seen in a long time.",2017
10,"I loved this movie, and I will watch it again. This is my first review ever, and I've been on IMDb for years reading people's reviews to determine if I want to watch a movie or not. Does the movie have some flaws, YES! But a movie that can make me laugh, cry, feel anxious, and a whole lot of emotions I cannot explain is a win win for me. All the characters are awesome, every single one of them. Wished the movie had been 3 hours. Don't try to analyze this movie,go watch and just FEEL!",2017
10,"the movie is fantastic. i absolutely love it and the acotrs and actresses are amazing, Mckenna Grace who plays Mary and Chris Evans who plays Frank is absolutely suited for the role. The young actress, Mckenna Grace is a very talented girl and actress, and Chris Evans is amazing as the Uncle role. They are so great with each other, that is was so touching when they were together. i believe that this movie will be one of the greatest in the world. I LOVE IT!",2017
9,"Octavia Spencer has carved out quite a niche for herself in feel-good, family-friendly dramas. At first, she often played caregivers (mostly nurses) during her feature film career, which began in 1996 when she played a nurse in ""A Time to Kill"". But then she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2011's ""The Help"" (in which she played a maid). Since her Oscar win, the variety in her movie roles has expanded, but she seems to have gravitated towards a certain kind of cinematic story. She took on roles like the peace-loving Johanna in the ""Divergent"" films, a loving grandmother involved in a child custody battle in ""Black or White"" (2015) and a brilliant and protective NASA supervisor in ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Then, in 2017, she played God himself (well, HERself) in ""The Shack"" – and a loving grandmotherly figure on the fringes of a child custody battle in the terrific family-friendly drama ""Gifted"" (PG-13, 1:41).",2017
10,Just a terrific movie with one of the best performances by a child actor in years. Chris Evans was terrific. Octavia Spencer is the gold standard. Lindsay Duncan was so good. ,2017
8,"We are often told by others what should and shouldn't be important to us, especially when we are young. As a juvenile, Frank's sister, Diane was strictly prohibited from making her own choices based on her own values. This strict and controlling upbringing lead her to a life of anger and misery. Prior to taking her own life, Diane charged her brother with the task of raising Mary differently than that. She wanted Mary to get to be a kid and learn what life is really about. 'Gifted' is a story is about Frank's fight for what he values, what his sister valued, and most importantly, what a little girl named Mary values more than anything in the world.",2017
9,"As a parent you'll find it hard to look at your child without admiring that silly behavior or constant charm. Our children are - after all - a driving purpose & Marc Webbs ""Gifted"" has no limit to those little reminders of why. Starring Christopher Evans as ""Frank Adler"", this family oriented drama will have you smiling for hours at the wacky comments and sheer intellect ""Mary Adler"" (McKenna Grace) portrays in her character is a child prodigy - something I'm sure we all see in our sons & daughters, regardless of where they stand. The plot-line here was surprisingly soft and presented host of lessons that highlighted the importance of a trusting relationship with your child; not to mention dealing with those who might try and stand between it. It's a title every father must see and every mother should feel encouraged by. Where there's love, there's life!",2017
9,"I want to be worthy of writing this summary but, even if I blow it, you should see Gifted (2017). Firstly, what's not to like about Chris Evans. Yes, he's best known for playing Captain America in all those Marvel blockbusters but, if you haven't seen his self- directed Before We Go (2014), do yourself a favor and watch it on Netflix soon. In Gifted, he plays the kind of father every little girl deserves, and wishes she had.",2017
8,"Gifted is a movie about relationships, family, and doing what's right for children. The film centers around Mary (McKenna Grace), a 7 year old who is academically gifted, she can do mathematics at a college/adult level. She lives with her uncle (Chris Evans), because her mother died and her father has never been in the picture. She starts the first grade and of course finds it tedious because she's far beyond that level. Her grandmother comes to take her to live with her in Boston where she can be put in a prestigious school and be surrounded by tutors. Mary's uncle doesn't want that because her mother said she wanted Mary to be a normal kid and enjoy life and not be constantly taught at all her life. But Mary's grandmother isn't about to give up.... they end up going to court over the matter and fighting for custody. The film features excellent performances by every member of the cast. It also has great writing. The writing brings out the films heart, it shows the love and sense of family that Mary and her uncle have. I 100% suggest Gifted! 8/10.",2017

Frank asks Mary about making friends at school. Mary says that she can't make friends with ""idiots"". The older and wiser Frank tells her, ""Your Mother would have wanted you to have compassion."" Mary's Mother Diane was the brilliant mathematician, who tragically committed suicide after Mary was born. ",2017
3,GIFTED mixes up story tones –forces emotions - is loaded with clichéd characters - and is the victim of a wonky script gone awry. GIFTED is a toxic mix of Good Will Hunting and a failed TV pilot. ,2017
10,"Perhaps the best film I've ever seen with Chris Evans. This film was warm and moving with characters that I could relate to under the unique circumstances of the story line. A decent drama well worth watching. How nice to see a film without gun play violence for a change. Could Hollywood make more of these films, please? This film has an obvious message on how to raise children, and why it's wrong to drive them to madness. 'Why does a child's happiness matter' is all you need to know about this film before watching it. Truly a breath of fresh air in the blood-fest we call entertainment these days.",2017
8,"It's not perfect (it becomes too solemn toward the end, and the ending itself seemed abrupt) , but this crowd pleaser pleased me. Chris Evans, out of superhero armor for once, was quite good as a man raising his young prodigy of a niece, Mary, alone following his sister's suicide. The niece, although tough at first, grew on me a lot, Octavia Spenser and Jenny Slate were charming in smaller roles, and Lindsay Duncan was magnificent as the film's villainess so to speak, and Mary's grandmother, imbuing her possibly one-note character with a nuanced, three-dimensional performance so that you couldn't help but understand her from time to time. The script was funny, tender, and moving.",2017
8,"This movie is super fantastic! I totally loved it and did not want it to end. All the actors are amazingly convincing and talented. Both little Mckenna Grace (who plays Mary) and Chris Evans (who plays Frank) are absolutely perfect for their roles. Mckenna Grace is extremely talented for someone her age. I LOVE their natural chemistry in this movie. This movie held my attention and warmed my heart! This is not a shoot-em-up, action-packed movie, there's no nudity. It is a wonderfully warm and fuzzy family movie. Excellent acting and editing. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.",2017

Second, Jackie Chan turned in a subdued and very good character portrayal. Third,the movie was not the typical martial arts laden Jackie Chan performance. There were martial art scenes but they were not over done as in prior Chan movies. Supporting cast led by Pierce Brosnan were also very good. In summary, if your a fan of the action genre you will not be disappointed.",2017

9,"I knew ahead of time going in this movie was more about the story that it was Jackie beating the crap out of goons (which I personally love to see). Both Jackie and Pierce did very well in the respective roles, Pierce's malice really shined through in the story while Jackie's dramatic acting was very believable and really helped immersion. I was impressed by the actions scenes as they were fitting and not ill placed. Everyone added to the storyline and wasn't throw in there to just to give us action. Even though this doesn't fit the standard role we usually see Mr. Chan in, he really brings depth to a story that could have been shallow. If you're debating it, don't just watch it.",2017

The movie starts with good background story, i can see the bonding between father and daughter, loving each other who are living in London, England. Then the tragic bombing happened, unfortunately Chan daughter was nearby and killed by that tragedy. Someone claim that was their deeds, and it is a terrorist attack. I feel really sad and sorry with Chan, i can see he is really suffered because of his loss. I'm so impressed with Chan acting in this movie, it seems he really does his role so deep and emotional. I can see Chan character who is broken, suffering, mysterious, have a dark past and loss his patience with the investigation which take a long time, because it involve some political issues with Ireland, who is in peace agreement with England. I think this is one of the best Chan acting performa in his entire career. ",2017

Jackie plays an Oscar worthy role as a deeply mournful parent looking for answers and won't take no for an answer. Pierce was sensational and very believable. One of the best all around casting jobs I've seen in a while. If you know nothing about the Brits and the IRA conflicts, spend 5 minutes on Wikipedia before going to see the movie. This is a must see!!",2017

Though a lot of kids today don't remember him, but from the mid nineties through the early 2000s, Jackie Chan was a Chinese martial artist who unexpectedly rose up to the action hero ranks of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. But unlike the big stature of Schwarzenegger, Chan had some of the fastest reflexes and spectacular fighting skills that we haven't seen since Bruce Lee. His playful personality made him popular worldwide, especially with children. So what happened?",2017
7,"This really isn't the film you expect it to be. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan in the lead roles points towards an action-packed revenge thriller, but for the first half of the film, it's actually a well- balanced, dark and often dramatically intense film. Then once you're settled into that, it switches back to the Taken-esque action thriller you were expecting in the first place, providing some good entertainment, but getting a little stuck in developing a genuinely enthralling story.",2017
10,REVIEW - THE FOREIGNER ,2017
8,"The Foreigner is based on the novel 'The Chinaman', by Stephen Leather. Quan Ngoc Minh(Jackie Chan) loves his daughter Fan(Katie Leung), a lot. Fan is killed in a bomb blast. Quan will go to any means necessary, to find the people behind the bomb blast & bring them to justice. ",2017
9,"I love believable characters and believable stories in action movies. This is not a normal Jackie Chan movie but he's the right guy for the role. He just does the things that makes you feel good about his character. The story has a progression that's absorbing, it's mesmerizing and continues to get better all the way to the climax. I want to tell you all about this but I'd spoil it for you. Go see it!",2017
7,"When I came to knew that Martin Campbell directed Brosnan in GoldenEye (1995) and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale(2006), I knew that I was going to experience something refreshing. China-Man and Ex-Bond in one flick! A composed and crafted script from the crew. Much better than Blade Runner 2049. You don't need IMAX/3D ""immersion"" if you can deliver it to the audience!",2017
8,"The basic plot of ""The Foreigner "" revolves around an Asian businessman (Jackie Chan) with a hidden past whose life gets turned upside-down when his teenage daughter is killed in a politically-motivated act of terrorism. His search for the elusive killers leads him to a British / Irish government official (Pierce Brosnan), whose own ""muddy"" past holds clues to the killers and their motives.",2017
8,"This is a dark, and gritty political action thriller featuring Jackie Chan. Chan is surprisingly good as a grizzled father out for vengeance, and you could completely overlook the fact that he used to play comical action heroes. Chan's demeanor portrays the vulnerability, heartbreak, and repressed anger of a parent. His character can be compared to a combination of Jackie Chan because of his acrobatic stunts, Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills for his dogged determination and questionable tactics, and Jason Bourne for his ability to outfox his opponents. Pierce Brosnan, the former James Bond actor, is a perfect antagonist to Chan. He plays a politician who has to resolve the problem or he will receive consequences from all sides. In fact, his character was as likable as Chan, but in the scenes where he is with Jackie Chan, Chan dominates every take. Acting-wise, this is a great surprising coming from actors not known for dramatic roles, yet both leads (especially Jackie Chan) manages to keep a gripping performance that makes the audience rooting and feeling sympathetic for them till the very end. The action scenes are reminiscent of the Bourne series. They are brutal, and grounded. There are scenes of Chan's trademark acrobatic and improvisional fighting style, but they look brutal and deadly. The filming of the fight scenes is also similar to Paul Greengrass's work, but is more effective and less nauseating than in the Bourne Supremacy. Another interesting aspect of the movie is that the theme is very dark, and grim for a Jackie Chan movie. It is a very smooth transition for Chan from comical action hero to straight action heroes. I look forward to more interesting works like this from Jackie Chan.",2017
7,"I've been a fan of Jackie Chan since I was a kid. I grew up watching movies like Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour, First Strike. So I was excited to see him back and he proves he is one of the best action stars ever. ",2017

6,"'The Foreigner' is quite formulaic action revenge thriller that doesn't offer much new or fresh, but still somehow manages to stay away from the path of dull clichés. Dedicated and masterful performances by its two leads, Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan, who both are little bit in a different water than most of us are used to see them. For me (I think I'm not the only one), the two actors were the only reason I watched that film, and I felt not a second of time wasted. It was nice breath of fresh air to see Jackie Chan's darker, and more serious side. Also, it seemed that writer had put some effort into plotting the 'cloak and dagger' situation between government officials with hazing the clear borders between good and evil.",2017
8,"Jackie Chan a legend in the cinematic world for many famous roles many will remember for years to come. With epic Marshal Arts sequences, a sense of comedic delivery and great chemistry with a variety of actors, it is no wonder the man has been involved in so many projects. And after a hiatus, the legend seems to be making a comeback lending his voice to Lego Ninjago and now returning in a live action film the Foreigner. Does the man still have the magic, or was he better left sitting on the sidelines? Robbie K here to review another movie and as always let's get started. ",2017
3,"The Snowman is a disaster. It's not only a disaster, it's an unfathomable disaster. This film had absolutely everything going for it. I've not read the source material, that the film is based on, but it's being hailed as one the best books in its genre here in Norway. The director, Tomas Alfredson, has made some great films in the past and the cast is great. Yet the film is a complete mess.",2017
4,"The original material the film is based on, ""The Snowman"" by Jo Nesbo, is a gripping thriller brilliantly composed with complex characters. However, this film adaption lacks everything. Frankly, there is very little left of the original story. The scriptwriters not only tampered with the plot, but altered characters as well. It is an entirely different story that is badly constructed with gaping holes in the plot. ",2017
3,I just don't know where to begin... ,2017
2,What happened to this movie ?,2017
4,"The snowy white landscapes of Oslo seemed like the perfect setting for chilling crime thriller The Snowman, a film based on Jo Nesbø's novel of the same name. The trailers promised so much and with a lead actor like Michael Fassbender on board, it had the potential to be one of the most intense films of the year. ",2017
3,I made the mistake of reading the book again before watching the movie So had high expectations. It was The Snowman that got me hooked on Jo Nesbo and was excited when I saw the trailer. I walked out of it at the end feeling very disappointed.,2017
7,"There doesn't seem to be a lot of love for The Snowman, which is a pity since most of the elements I love about Scandinavian crime drama are there: an overall unglamourous look; icy landscapes; a protagonist with emotional issues and difficulties connecting with other people; gruesome killings; dark family secrets, enough red herrings to fill a small sea, and a surprise twist at the end. In fact, had this been a Norwegian movie, then I think that most people would have praised it as pleasantly non-Hollywood, but now they don't now what to make of it so they give it a critical drubbing. Director Tomas Alfredson (of Tinker Tailer Sodier Spy fame) knows how to put the elements together in the best tradition of series like The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and The Bridge (Bron) and films like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Män Som Hatar Kvinnor), but, to be fair, The Snowman is also the lesser of this group.",2017
9,"As I read many reviews the two things people hate this movie for is: It's a crime-thriller and not a horror story like the book was. Because I haven't read the book I can't say on what level they differ, but the movie is still very interesting and exciting. And the other thing is the ending. I agree that it comes a bit fast and leaves you kinda hanging, BUT it fits the whole frosty northern scenery well and makes the story line a full circle.",2017
10,"Differs from the typical fare with a nice steady build up of suspense, gives satisfying clues, and in the end wraps up the mystery. If you are looking for Jigsaw, then this is not the film for you. I realize that some of the disappointed reviews were from folks who were hoping to be frightened. I personally have no love for shock value, and am never frightened by films. If i wanted to be scared, I would go watch Oprah or the Kardashians to be properly terrified at how absurdly stupid and inane the human race has become. Otherwise there isn't much a screen can do to terrify me. This isn't trying. It has the same goals as Wind River, but it fulfills them better. Probably because Detective Harry isn't a blundering idiot. I am unwilling to give up the plot like some others. I can say; nice pace, good story, not particularly original, but very well done. Exactly as it should be. Its not an art house film. Its a thriller mystery, and a engaging one.",2017
8,The movie has a rapid pace from the first 2 minutes. You start to have ideas of who can be the snowman and with each scene you will change your mind. Loved the fact that it's not that easy to understand the action with back and forth pieces of the puzzle.,2017
8,"other reviews critique based on Hollywood tropes and complain because they are missing. Instead the film strives, successfully, to evoke the atmosphere of Scandinavian Noire, while employing the story telling techniques of Knut Hamsun - no character development, no exposition, and entering the story mid-crisis. I wish it had been recorded in Norwegian so we could appreciate the conflict between Bergen and Oslo, so integral to the books. it's a mood film, not simply a whodunit. bringing in familiar USA actors was a clever red herring, but probably won't be appreciated, and instead some will complain these actors didn't get more screen time. finally, the anti-tourism photography of winter instead served the story and was worth the price of admission to the big screen view. Overall a needed antidote to the last 20 years of execrable USA superhero fare.",2017
8,Kinda tired of people giving low score for a movie because they don't understand or they don't like these kinda movies yet they watch it or they compare it to a book. ,2017
7,"The Snowman was right from the start panned with bad reviews. But I found this film was way better on the second viewing, just like Tomas Alfredsons Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy was. Exactly the same way! And that says a lot. Alfredson likes to do some subtle moves.",2017
9,"Seen a lot of negativity in the reviews. Here's an explanation. 1. It is a 5th book from the Jo Nesbø, Harry Hole series.",2017
8,It's a real bummer that some people saw this and didn't like it. It's a bummer for them since this was one of the best movies I've seen in 2017. This a truly unique film and was a breath of fresh air in a climate of super hero flicks and overdone remakes. The score and the scenes were intoxicatingly beautiful.,2017
1,"In summary.
The film doesnt make sense.
Havent read the book but i guess that over 300 pages you get more sense than this.
What if rebecca ferguson didnt go into the trap?
What if Michale fassbender didnt get drunk?
What if Jk simmonds dint shout?
Have T Alfredson(mind you he made Tinker(a sensationally good movie ) gone mad?
The script writers(ie same as tinker) were they aware that the cutting would in fact make them surplus?
the end",2017
10,"Obviously we have seen different movies. Alfredson's The snowman is an excellent piece of modern cinema, built not on the conventions of a thriller, like Nesbo's book(although of course it works as a thriller), but on the tensions between the unfolding images, the mesmerizing effect of a hypnotic pace that encloses us in a dark and cold vision, the glorious revelations of landscapes(city landscapes, physical landscapes and human ones)that reveal themselves at certain points filling our regard with a sense of beauty. As the film went on, I felt immersed in its charm, building to an ending that creates not so much the tension one hopes to meet in a thriller, but a dark feeling, first as the killer sinks helplessly in the icy water(in a glimpse,as the film's narrative economy is extraordinary all the way through, in contrast with some other film that met glorious critical applause these days but needed 2.45 minutes of boring storytelling to make everything explicit), and second in the short epilogue, which is filmed in a way that creates a very strong impression, stressed by the music,leaving me shocked and thoughtful on the way out. I'll take it! .The snowman is an absolute masterpiece that deserves to be rediscovered in the far future, like many movies of the past have at some point been.",2017
10,"It is a class thriller and gripping till the end. It is one of the finest in the class of thriller movies in terms of screenplay, photography and last but not least the story telling mechanism is stylish. Mystery is held tight and never could be revealed.",2017
7,"The Snowman is a psychological thriller based upon Jo Nesbo's critically acclaimed novel of the same name. This film received mixed to negative critics but I have to disagree. Despite a few flaws, this film is overall above average in my book. Let's take a look at what several critics had to say and compare their points to my personal experience.",2017
10,Why is everyone hating on this movie? ,2017
8,"The opening snow scene depicts an isolated hut where a kid's ""Uncle Jarnis"" drops in unexpectedly to grill his kid on Norwegian history. When the boy doesn't know the answer, the ""uncle"" takes it out on the mom, i.e. the uncle's mistress. When the couple repair to a private room, the kid builds a snow­man out­side. It's fitting as in the quiz the Norwegian head of state resumed his position on June 7, 1945, and a snow­man gets its head put on it, too. Amidst some grinding gears the visit ends in separation. The movie picks up years later when some­body has been dismembering women, mothers whose care for their young left some­thing to be desired.",2017
2,"Who would ever name their son Harry Hole? That is one of the many questions that crossed my mind as I watched The Snowman, which I suppose is technically a movie, but fails miserably to deliver on many of the standard qualifications that 99.9% of all other movies meet.",2017
7,"For a start, my way into this is without having read any of the Harry Hole novels (which all the critics seems to have). So I can look at this movie from a somewhat more objective view and, I conclude, it's not bad. To me this feels like more of a super hero movie in genre in that the characters, both the likable and the less likable characters are a bit flat, I admit that but I think it works out well (this is why it reminds me of a classic super hero movie).",2017
2,"The Snowman could honestly be a contender for worst thriller of the year. It's dull, boring, confusingly plotted, drearily acted, lazily edited and poses more questions than it can ever be bothered to answer. Why are all the Norwegians in the film British? Why is it set in Oslo? Why does the killer use snowmen as a calling card? What is the purpose of J.K. Simmons character, other than to effectively walk on screen and pronounce, ""And I'm J.K. Simmons""? Who are these women getting their pictures taken with a camera-phone? And finally, how could a film with such a strong ensemble cast and effective cinematography end up being such an unmitigated disaster? I know not one of the answers and, frankly, the time it took me to watch the film and write this review is about as much attention as I'm prepared to give this shoddy work. The most thrilling moment of the film was the end credits, as I could finally leave the cinema. Avoid like the plague.",2017
5,"Let's start off with me saying that I loved the source material when I read it a few years ago, and when I saw that it's gonna get a movie adaptation I was really hyped for it. This movie had every chance of being something amazing, the book it's based on, the director, the cast would all be amazing, but somehow they messed the whole thing up. ",2017
10,"Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.",2017

10,"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.",2017
9,"Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. ",2017
4,"I really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.",2017
4,"I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.",2017
4,"I do not understand the reviews... What the heck? This movie was maybe not worth 1 star, I agree, because I enjoyed the brutality to some extent. But it falls very short of being the sort of masterpiece it is made out to be. I chose to rate it 5.",2017
10,"This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.",2017
10,"we finally get the Wolverine we have been asking for, for the past 15 years and it's his last time. Well i guess he couldn't have ended it in any better way as a last farewell to the fans and his signature role. Not only that but it looks like this one blows all the other superhero movies out of the water and i hope you Weebs go pay for your ticket to see this as well instead of watching a cam version online so we send the message that we want more of these kind of movies.",2017
10,"What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended.",2017

10,"The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.",2017
1,This is highly overrated. This is nowhere near as good as critics say it is. 1 star for the little girl.,2017
10,"Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.",2017
1,I am a fan of the X-Men movies. They are all fun and exciting to watch. They are also beautiful to see. This is not true for Logan. Sadly.,2017
9,"James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful.",2017
8,"The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",2017
2,"I just finished watching Logan and--oh my God--what a dismal, dreary, dreadful and dumb bit of cinematic nihilism that was. Brutally and graphically and disturbingly violent too.",2017
1,"The movie started off well, with Prof X jailed and drugged in a DIY hideout maintained by Wolvie and Caliban. Pierce is a great villain, but there's no payoff with his abilities or menace. He's simply the foreman for the evil corporation that is growing test tube mutants and hunting them down. Besides having one robotic hand, him or his Reavers don't really have any glaring cybernetic advantages. It would have been interesting to see different types of cyborg Reavers as in the comics, but in this movie, they are simply claw fodder.",2017
4,"The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.",2017

1,"If you want to find intelligent people who are actually capable of reviewing a movie, then you have those here who have voted miserably for this movie The movie is full of errors and the story line is extremely predictable Following are some of the issues I found 1) Majority of the movie is cliché, you have a failing superhero, his ailing mentor and a young prodigy in a journey to save the young one. The mentor is taken out by the villain, makes the superhero very angry who in the end sacrifices himself, killing the villain and the young one goes free into an unclear future. Any person should be able to predict the ending of the movie after just watching 10 minutes of the start and here are people comparing this with the Dark Knight!!!! Unbelievable!!!! 2) The prey seems to be running after the predator in the movie. The kids with superpowers are already trained as shown in the movie. They are not poor scared souls, they are lethal, mentally and physically. You can see glimpses of that during the end, when they kill off the mercenaries ruthlessly. With their unique powers combined, its a surprise they were even once contained in a facility. Sometimes you can see the kinds wimping and crying and few moments later they freeze someone off or electrocute someone without remorse. 3) Logan witnesses a group of drones towards the end which makes him realize that the kids are in danger. Why on earth would a dozen surveillance drones move around in a bunch? Shouldn't they be spread out to do their job better or was their job to get noticed by wolverine 4) X-24 was shot by an adamantium bullet in the end which blew half his head off. When wolverine was shot by that bullet in X Men Origins he only lost his memory, another inconsistency. 5) Professor X knew well that they had a vicious mercenary group hell bent after them. Why on Earth would he then suggest that they spend the night at the Munsons'? That's the most stupid thing to do. Oh yes now I get it why, its so that the mutant wolverine can be introduced in the movie and it was the perfect time for him to die. Killed by someone who he thought was Logan, that's sure to get a lot of sympathy right there. 6)Logan clearly knows that they are supposed to keep a low profile, in spite of that he picks up a fight with the Reavers 7) The producers had this project nicely figured out. Kill Wolverine, kill professor X, earn a lot of sympathy and thereby earn a lot of money. Also keep a bunch of mutant kids alive so that in case they fall short of lunch money, well you know what they will be working on. There are scores of mistakes with the story line but I do not wish to waste any more of my time so my advice for those who haven't watched this movie yet, don't.",2017
2,"A group of heavy hitters, one way or another. Mark Whalberg starred and produced ""The Fighter"" Mel Gibson gave us ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion Of The Christ"" John Lithgow is one the best actors we've got, from the transsexual in ""The World According To Garp"" to Winston Churchill in ""The Crown"" and Will Ferrel one of the most popular comedians around for over a decade. All together in a comedy! Now, let me ask you. is this the best they could come up with? Lazy, opportunistic without a single original idea. Is this movie going to make any money? I'm asking because if it does, I should shut up and dedicate myself to gardening or something like that. Clearly, money is the only reason behind this enterprise and I'm giving it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew and all their hard work.Phew.",2017

I almost walked out after paying big $$. The parts that bother me were:",2017
3,"A depressingly nihilistic film that would have at least been commendable for its unabashed cruelty - that is, if an out-of-place clichéd 'happy ending' hadn't been tacked on. As such, it only works as an exercise in awkward gags and uncomfortable dramatic beats, hammering the final nails into the coffin of three careers while it's at it. Now, if you're looking for a darkly comic view at a dysfunctional family, you'll find this for the first half of the film. If you want an upbeat, feel-good family comedy, keep your fingers in your ears and your eyes 'wide shut' until the final twenty minutes. If you want a good Christmas film, I suggest you go home and put The Polar Express back in the DVD player.",2017
3,"Daddy's Home 2 had the potential of being comedic and fun like how the first film was. But like most comedy sequels, this one was a dud with most of the laughs already shown in the trailers. While the rest of the 90 or so minutes being completely a drag and boring. The first film was a lot of fun with the concept of step dad vs. dad with Will Ferrell vs. Mark Wahlberg. They do make a perfect comedic duo. Daddy's Home 2 tries for the cheap laughs and gags but it's less than the first, and the newcomers were a fun addition like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow. But there talent was not enough to save this film. Not even Mark Wahlberg, and Will Ferrell chemistry was good enough to make it worth watching. ",2017
4,"Daddy's Home 2 is my latest review. It's a follow-up to 2015's surprise hit, Daddy's Home. The first outing wasn't great to begin with. Guess what, ""2"" is even worse.",2017
4,"The daddy rivalry that made the first film funny is over as we have moved on to co-dads. They decide to spend Christmas together as a single family than as two families and then they get news the grand dads are coming for Christmas, most likely because Sean Anders scripted this film in the cubicle next to ""Bad Mom's Christmas."" Mel Gibson plays Mark Wahlberg's father and it was as bad as it sounds. John Lithgow is Will Ferrell's father, a polar opposite of Mel Gibson.",2017
2,"I didn't expect anything but was also not prepared to witness one of the worst movies ever. I never watch a comedy in a theatre (ok, there were only 12 people in the audience) and no on e laughed out loud throughout the entire 90 minutes. and at the end it gets even repulsive.",2017
9,"This is much better than the first one. I'm 50 and my daughter is 19 and we laughed all the way thru it. The first one is a little to sappy for me, but the second one is pure comedy. It's just fun. The 4 male stars have the best chemistry and deliver lines with such timing it's refreshing. Have fun",2017
6,"Daddy's Home 2 is very similar to its predecessor. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like the second. There are a ton of cheap gags and Will Ferrell gets in situations that should have left him hospitalized constantly. The introduction of Mel Gibson and John Lithgow as the grandfathers just takes the opposite dads concept to the extreme as they are even farther out versions of the Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell characters. Most of the jokes weren't worth more than a chuckle, with the exception of an extremely relatable thermostat bit. The ending was stretching the limits of believably, even for a ridiculous comedy, but all in all it was solid ideal entertainment.",2017

1,What a colossal embarrassment for everyone involved in this criminal waste of celluloid. ,2017
3,This is a sequel with some slapstick comedy.,2017
8,"The critics sure slammed this one. Sure, it's not as funny as the first one, and way too sappy, but the additional all star cast and Christmas timing upped it a few notches. Still an entertaining and fun flick. 8/10 from me",2018
3,"For those still looking forward to Christmas, know that this week's forced Holiday pabulum, Daddy's Home 2 is proof that we've all been naughty this year and you should probably batten down the hatches before Santa Claus comes to your home and s**ts underneath your tree. This movie is a horrid, rage-inducing, ill-conceived exercise in dead-horse beating that's so on-its-face repulsive, that its obligatory last act koombaya resembles an upside-down diaper that's been left on someone's windshield.",2017
8,"This was a truly hilarious movie. Although it is something that is rare to say, but this sequel was better than the first movie. It was fun and heartwarming with comedic surprises. All the actors did a phenomenal job with their roles. The movie was light-hearted fun, just like you would expect from a good movie of this genre. Once again, I am reminded why comedy movies are the best (in my opinion).",2017
9,"100% chance of this movie being silly and ridiculous, so why go if you expect anything else? I was pleasantly surprised because Daddy's Home Two was much better than the first one. I laughed so hard I cried through the whole thing & the rest of the audience was laughing right along. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the one liners are hilarious. I plan to watch this every Christmas.",2017
1,"We had some hope this movie would be OK, but alas, it was raunchy, vulgar, and even lewd. I saw very young children coming in to watch this movie, being the 2nd one, I thought they probably knew what they were bringing these little ones to see. It hurt my heart to see the low and base behavior that was made to be funny.",2017
6,"Comedy and tragedy have always gone together hand-in-hand. Every great comedy tends to have its bitter-sweet moments: Roberts Blossom as the ""shovel-killer"" grandad in ""Home Alone"" (who always reminds me of my late Dad... in appearance I might add, not that he was a shovel killer!); John Candy's depressed shower-ring salesman in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles""; Ron Burgundy bawling in a phone box in ""Anchorman"". The balance between the two is the key thing and comedies can sometimes get it wrong (the Bird Woman in ""Home Alone 2"" for example!).",2017
8,"I laughed, I cried. You really kinda had to have the first one to follow this one right away though. I don't want to spoil the funniest scenes or the moving ones so I'll be short. Will Ferrell is on top of his game, hammy yet funny and real at the same time. The real star of the movie is an old pro working it harder than anyone, and that's John Lithgow. And John Cena has developed his comedy chops very well. And you'll never listen to a certain Christmas song the same way again.",2017
9,"I loved the first daddy's home. I thought it was a very funny and underrated comedy. Both Farrell and Wahlberg we're great in my opinion. So I guess you can say I was pumped to see this film. When the reviews came out for this movie, however, I was very heartbroken. Regardless, I still wanted to check it out. And this is yet another example of why I shouldn't listen to critics. This movie was so hilarious! At least every 10 minutes it made me laugh out loud! Even had me gut busting laughing out of my seat a couple times. Almost all jokes hit or at least had me grinning. Of course, Farrell and Wahlberg are both fantastic as Brad and Dusty. They play their characters so well and couldn't imagine being played by anybody else. Let's talk about John Lithlow and Mel Gibson. They were awesome as the grandparents! All 4 of those actors had great chemistry and that is my number one pro of this movie! There are a couple of cons in this movie. Some of the jokes fall and can be cringe worthy. And sometimes the editing and pacing can be off. But other than that, I suggest you check it out. I guarantee you will have such a fun time! Laughter is the best medicine! 😂",2017
2,"I found this movie depressing, the fathers they added in the movie made it so not funny. Mel Gibson's character was horrible. I sat there thinking how is this supposed to be funny. I was hoping that it was going to play off from the end of the first one but no it went a dark direction. Certainly wouldn't go to another one if they happen to make one. I don't want to give away the story line so not mentioning specific parts. But back to Mel's Character and the Christmas part of this movie who thought having a awful father was going to make for good humor?",2017
7,"Dad's, the other half of the parental equation and perhaps one of the most dynamic job roles in the human repertoire. This responsibility is astounding for this job, each approached in a different way based on the personality of the dad. And just like the moms, Hollywood felt it was necessary to make a movie portraying this job, in an often-comical manner, to help portray the struggle and hopefully teach a lesson. Robbie K back in the movie theater trenches to review another hit feature entitled Daddy's Home 2 starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Will the dynamic duo get the magic right, or is this a series that needs a divorce? Read on to find out. ",2017
5,"Daddy's Home 2 is silly and over-the-top, and much like the first film isn't short of a few eye-rollers and missteps; there may not be a dance- off, but they don't shy away from that level of comicality. This sequel contains more slapstick humor, but in turn that also means more laughs. It never got me rolling on the floor so to speak, and most of the comedy was provided through actions rather than words, but that doesn't mean I didn't have a good time smiling throughout either.",2017
7,"Ironic that the Godfather of Once Popular Actors Shunned From Hollywood Literally Overnight, Mel Gibson, peaks his head out this weekend following several male showbiz careers being either wrecked or shamed (Kevin Spacey for starters)...",2017
9,"There have been two shows i have continued watching this fall, and Absentia is one of them. Stana Katic is one hell of an actress. The supporting cast is good, but pales in comparison. Not their fault, she is just that good. Its held my interest, kept me on the edge of my seat, and anxious for more. Cant say that about many shows these days. Kudos Ms Katic.",2017
5,"Watched this show only because i admire Katic, but aside of her, there is nothing interesting.",2017
3,"Almost every detective story is a fairy tale. But what differs a good detective story from a bad one? In a good detective story the events are somehow possible and believable. In a bad detective story what's going on on the screen is a continuous deception of the common sense. That's exactly what happens in all ten series of Absentia. We are asked to believe that the heroine doesn't need food, clothes, money, a place to sleep. She can run and fight the next day after an abdominal operation and losing a lot of blood. Her brother can operate on her without anesthesia, without the necessary surgical instruments, and the heroine miraculously avoids any infection. The way she's making on a bus for four hours, the police crosses just in ten minutes. But enough. The story is absolutely unbelievable, implausible and false. Not worth watching.",2017
5,"****SPOILERS AHEAD*** ***Don't read if you haven't watched the entire 10 episodes***. Great premise. Very promising series that, after 3 episodes turned out to be subpar. 1. There are characters that are redundant: there is not a real need for them for the plot to work. 2. It may be due to the very few time they had to shot it, but lots of the characters' developments lack coherence and are flat in some key aspects. 3. The finale missed completely the point of giving us insight about how the mystery was solved. If they didn't believe Emily until that point, why should they believe her after? 4. What has the cop exactly made as a contribution to the investigation of the plot's case? It seems like he wasn't needed at all. 5. They way they solved Emily and Nick's relationship is very unsatisfactory. Cause it is completely at odds with the feelings and things the actors portrayed before for their respective characters 6. No way Emily is that comfortable with Nick after no believing her. They spent minutes in long thrillery shots that didn't advanced the narrative and they invest almost none in their characters' development. The cinematography is very good but not the script is very poor. I hope they would be able to achieve more if they get more funding. 7The cliffhanger of the finale is devastating. No because there is a cliffhanger but because what it is imply on it. Which is inconsistent with all what they showed of Emily's true character in that same episode. I am fan of Katic's, but the show didn't live up to its hype. It does have strong points that emerge from time to time but they are no addressed to deliver their full potential, i.e. the idea of how an entire scheme to break someone to be his/her worst can be dismantled because the strong bond between a mother and her son.",2017
6,"The premise is fantastic but as I just finished episode 3, I've not yet found any of the plot lines unexpected. Rather I found the series unfolding with too many misdirections. ",2017
9,"Stana Katic is easily one of the most underrated actors out there, I'm glad to see her in a more meaty role compared to her last major role (Castle) we definitely need to see more of her. I really hope this show does well and we get to see the full story play out. Good story, good production, great cast.",2017
1,It's a long time since I've seen anything as bad as this. Acting is wooden and the plot doesn't have any cohesion. I can't believe that anyone could have scored it a 9 or 10. When it first started I thought it looked promising but after episode 2 I was disillusioned. I did watch all 8 episodes as I couldn't believe it could get any worse. I was wrong.,2017
10,"This series is exactly the type of entertainment we're missing in today's ""reality television"" culture. The characters feel refreshingly honest in how they would react to the admittedly wild circumstances, but overall you can tell this was a passion project for the entire cast. Katic herself is a force and her character is easily empathized with throughout her journey...seriously just give the woman her Emmy already! As far as some of the negative reviews out there...let's just say it looks like some Fillion fans are still unjustly resentful and angry at Katic for the situation that went down last year. I say ignore the haters and, if you like thrillers, suspense, and films with deeper emotions and characters, then you'll love Absentia!",2017
10,"**This review may contain spoilers** This show keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first moment. I'm only 3 episodes in and wish that I could see all of them at once, it is that gripping. It makes you want to immediately go straight to the next episode. ",2017
10,The lead actress is something else all together. One of the best I have seen on TV. I find her amazing I can believe I never heard of her before. I agree about the beautifying habits of TV and movies - i think it is human nature that leads to this reality of us wanting to watch pretty things but the acting - GOD DAMN.,2017
5,"I REALLY really wanted to like this & not just because I love Stana Katic...but I didn't. The story line is total confusion (could just be me though) & the acting (apart from Stana Katic & Cara Theobold) is not good. It's as though everyone has the same facial expression all the time. The writing is awful & full of holes & Heusinger fails to bring substance to his character. After watching 6 episodes, I'm really going to have to think long & hard before deciding to finish the last four episodes of the season. Can someone please give Stana Katic a decent television show, she deserves it!",2017
8,I genuinely enjoyed watching the first two episodes of this series. And am looking forward to the rest.The acting is spot on. And the cinematography is very well done. I can't wait to see the next episodes off Absentia . I hope it remains exciting until the end off the s I do love these types of shows .,2017

9,"I thought that the series would be something common, but I realized that its context is completely interesting. The plot is impressive and it keeps you intrigued. Stana develops a good role and bears no resemblance to Kate Beckett in Castle, she is a very good actress. If you like drama and a good story of suspense and intrigue ¡¡¡THIS IS THE BEST OPTION!!!",2017
3,"Far from being awful, yet far from being a show you are eagerly anticipating the next episode.",2017

10,"This show is a fast paced, taut, psychological thriller that takes you on a non-stop roller coaster ride of entertainment. Writing is a top-notch intellectual masterpiece rarely seen in today's climate of cookie cutter microwave lazy scripts and regurgitated pablum churned out to satisfy the appetites of the clueless masses. Absentia is an absolute tour de force for former Stana Katic breaking free from the yoke of the supporting role of Kate Becket from Castle!! ***WARNING***Don't start watching this show late at night unless you plan on losing sleep and don't have any pressing obligations the next day. Great show to binge once Amazon brings the show back online.

Take a look the vast majority of the negative reviews and you will see a few major common threads. Judging by the broken English, poor sentence structure, misspelled words, and repetitive phrasing prevalent throughout, it is clear that the negative reviews are being written by...
*
#1 People to whom English is a distant 2cnd language and therefore most of the inherent value of the content is being ""Lost In Translation""
*
#2 People who do speak English yet have IQs that are less than room temperature, and therefore lack the mental capacity and wherewithal to grasp the weightier plot points and/or comprehend the implications of the same.
*
#3 People who are die hard Nathan Fillion Kool Aid drinkers and have never even watched a single episode and are writing fake reviews to bash the lead actress who left their favorite show because she decided she would no longer suffer the verbal, psychological, and physical abuse that was dealt out by her costar on a regular basis.

#4 People who are a combination of #1 #2 and #3",2018
7,"I agree with another reviewer that Absentia had a very interesting premise, but I think that somewhere along the way it got a bit confused.

10,"This one is a Nice and interesting thriller. Good to see Castle girl back. The way the plot unfolds is really nice. Kudos to the screenplay & writers.

8,"Director Ruben Ostland has followed up his 2014 Golden Globe nominee Force Majeure with Cannes Palme d'Or winner The Square. The film is both a satire of the cultural elite of Stockholm and a sad commentary about the separation between individuals both within circles and between circles. The lead character, Christian (Claes Bang), is the curator of a museum of modern art that seeks to draw attention and donors through avant-garde exhibits and over-the-edge social media campaigns. The film follows Christian through a few weeks of his life when one of the hot new exhibits is ""The Square"", an actual square in the museum courtyard that is meant to be ""a sanctuary of trust and caring."" But rather than show trust and caring, the movie The Square raises a number of troubling questions: How thin is the veneer of civilization? Can political correctness substitute for empathy? Is art whatever a curator chooses to put in an art museum? And enveloping these questions is the separation of the circle of Stockholm's cultural elites from the City's homeless and immigrant population, as well as the separation of individuals within the City's cultural elite. One set piece in particular portrays the inability of the Stockholm's elite to communicate on a human level: It is Christian's meeting with Anne (Elisabeth Moss), a publicist, the day after a night of sex—and a bizarre argument over what to do with a used condom. In this scene Christian is totally unable to say the needed words about what had happened between them. (Anne, an American, comes across as much more able to relate to others than any of the Swedes in the movie.) Another memorable scene is the one in which a banquet for museum donors is interrupted when the performer (Terry Notary), playing an ape, goes out of control. The diners, who are initially frozen by their need for decorum, or perhaps by their need to display political correctness, ultimately go ape themselves. Perhaps not a total surprise since the same donor diners had earlier stampeded their way to a luncheon in a lighter scene. There are many sub-plots in the film—some satirizing interactions within Stockholm's upper class, others between classes— perhaps leaving some viewers displeased by the way the film jumps without warning from one set piece to another. Others may dislike long stretches of art-film inactivity in many of the episodes—something that explains why the movie lasts for 2 hours and 22 minutes. Nevertheless, The Square does capture the alienation of modern society, and does it with plenty of dark humor.",2017

7,"'The Square' is visually beautiful, well acted not so subtle (I mean, all is seen on the surface and it doesn't go deeper) satire on modern art and modern society with its political correctness and freedom of expression. Although the modern art is very easy target for parody and satire, 'The Square' does not fall into banal mockery of subject and touches the matter quite briefly. I mean, there are not too many puns towards the art scene. The film concerns more about other, and more serious subjects that definitely needs the discussion - political correctness, freedom of speech and creativity, how far we must go with tolerance, the hypocrisy about the care for weaker ones. All important themes, but the film played too safe too many times. The humor (or satire) could have been darker and sharper. More edgy! Pacing was little bit uneven and the film seemed to drag its feet for the last 35 minutes.",2017
8,"According to Swedish director Ruben Östlund (""Force Majeure""), society today has turned its back on the social contract, the obligation that people not only express their concerns for other's well-being but act upon them in concrete and meaningful ways. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Östlund's latest film, The Square, mercilessly skewers the moral hypocrisy of the contemporary art museum world in Stockholm, particularly taking aim at Christian (Claes Bang), the museum's chief curator whose pretensions are repeatedly called to task in creative and sometimes bizarre ways during the two hour and twenty minute film. ",2017
5,"I watched ""The Square"" at the Helsinki Film Festival today. The cast sounded great to me and since it has won the Palme d'Or, I was sure of being up for a treat. However, I waited...waited and waited. 150 minutes passed by and I could not get what I craved for. The social satire felt incomplete and too forced in some scenes, as having too many scenes with beggars, baby cries, noises, dogs barking, phone ringing etc. There could have been so much more.

The audience laughed (yes, laughed) constantly throughout and gave the film a solid round of applause at the end (a rare event in my experience). What looked on paper like a 140-minute high-conceit skewering of artistic pretension ended up as a delightful comedy of modern manners with little overt political agenda. The fact that most of the plot lines are left unresolved would normally confound an audience, but even this ends up feeling natural. There are a couple of spectacular camera moves (the ""Vertigo""reference in particular) and the poster set-piece with the ""ape"" is, for my money, even more tense and thrilling than the avalanche sequence from the same director's ""Force Majeure"" (which some critics are calling superior, but I beg to differ). As with ""The Lives of Others"" I came out of this one knowing I was present at the birth of a classic.",2017

1,"I am not disappointed in this movie, no. I am shocked and disappointed at the IMDb community. A comedy with a 7-8 rating? That seems like a movie worth watching, no questions asked. 
But this movie... I can't remember the last time I saw something as boring and cringeworthy as this sh*t. Probably not since The Lobster (2015). The simplest way to describe it is the following. A movie about snob culture that is in itself, snobby. It makes fun of how things like modern art and corporate projects have gotten meaningless and superficial, but in my opinion does a poor job at it. It's supposed to be a comedy, yet I didn't laugh at all until the sex scene, which was so abrupt and absurd I burst out laughing - while the whole theater watched in uncomfortable silence. I could've given it a second star because of that, except I would have stopped watching it long before had I not been at the movie theater. Also, I just want to lower the rating as much as possible :)))
The scenes were so so, sooo long. Totally unecessary in my opinion. If I'd cut them in half I wouldn't have missed anything. They had me squirming in my seat and seriously considering to leave the theater. I mean seriously, a ""comedy"" 2 and a half hours long? Give me a break..I should have known it wasn't any good. 
So if you get what I'm saying about snobby movies, don't watch this. As for anyone who liked this movie, guess what, you're a snob too.
Ahahah jk",2017
3,"The only thing I like about this movie is that it is a criticism of the absurdity that can sometimes result in many eyes, the art world. If the fact that someone says it, it means that something is already good. The problem is that it is the same thing that happens to the film, due to the fact that they do it, it does not have to be good and for my taste it is not.",2018
7,"Most of you may know the Swedish screenwriter-director Ruben Östlund thanks to his previous project, 2014's Turist"" – Force Majeure"" internationally –, an acclaimed psychological drama about man not being man enough"" when his family's lives are endangered by an avalanche in ski resort. Östlund continues exploring ""Turist's"" major theme further here: comfort zones and what happens when we dare or are forced to leave them. Comfort zones govern our lives – we create them for personal use and on every level of human society – but in order to reach new grounds, we need to leave them. And if the zones end or vanish for some reason, the life as we have known it can break down quite easily. Turist"" is about one specific situation, The Square"" explores the theme connected to art world, although art can be seen as metaphor for man's creative or spiritual side, which to me seemed even more suitable. The central character is an director of a museum (played by Claes Bang), a nice guy who gets into trouble both in private life and professionally. It plays out like a situational comedy about polarities, in art, our life and modern man in general. Through different scenes and events we get to witness and contemplate about how modern man wants everything to be ""simple"" – black or white, either/or – but there are always two sides to everything, and you can't really have the one without the other. For example, We want the art to mean something and touch us deeply, but don't like to invest ourselves and open up for it; we want to express ourselves freely but can't necessarily tolerate others also doing this; we want power but we don't like responsibilities, etc etc. Yes, the approach is rather artsy but the movie is still pretty mainstream friendly, thanks to all the ""comedy"". Actors do wonderful job illustrating all these polarities on screen. This long 142 minute movie follows and examines the characters closely and relies on nuanceful performances quite heavily. The main problem is the directing style which sometimes seems to slow down just because, not that a situation couldn't be done any faster. There are scenes where camera finds it target and just stays with it almost to the point of dozing off, just because it can. I think Östlund has tried to prove a point – we want fast results, not to invest ourselves – but I also think he has overused it here. Movies nowadays are usually not that slow anymore, and it wears you down getting accustomed to this slowness. But it's still an intriguing and quite powerful movie about what life and art mean, or can mean. For its common ground, but also for its dark humor, expressiveness and inventiveness, The Square"" is like a dark companion piece for Jodorowski's joyous Poesía sin fin"" which also hit our cinemas recently. I can't say I understood the meaning of the major setpiece of performance artist attacking"" a fancy gala party, but I loved it (the poster shows him too). He's like an uncanny mix of Bruce Lee and monkey man! That's what art is supposed to be all about, I guess: taking us out of our comfort zones and making us feel something even without understanding it well. By the way, although most of the dialogue is in Swedish, some is in English and some major supporting characters are played by people we know from American entertainment, such as Dominic West (The Wire"", The Affair"") and Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men"").",2017

He finds his friend idea brilliant to track his cell, finds where that ""bad ass"" guy lives and drops scary letters to every flat at that building (13 floors).
He tries to conceal himself but he visits that area with his tesla. REALLY? How many people in Sweden- if not mistaken- drive (a damaged) tesla?
At the end, you feel like a looser in every aspect (money, time, etc).
However, the movie makes you laugth a couple of times. But that does not make the movie comedy!
IMDB administrators should check the definition of comedy.
IMDB users have trolled hard at this movie 7.4+",2018
10,"The Square is a piece of very contemporary art that is about very contemporary art and its ambivalent relationship to our social reality and responsibilities. ""Relational aesthetics"" is the interviewed artist's term, i.e., exploring the relationship between art and our social reality. ",2017
1,"A prestigious Stockholm museum's chief art curator finds himself in times of both professional and personal crisis as he attempts to set up a controversial new exhibit. Watching the trailer and later the movie The Square made The Room look like the damn Godfather. This movie was beyond dumb and retarded and it's running time of 2hrs and 27mins doesn't help either and don't get me start on the ridiculous perfomances either i mean that entire scene with the 'Man-Ape' was so retarded and it makes me wonder how the hell did this receive praise, awards and even more: good reviews and high scores to begin with. (0/10)",2018
8,"Not a comedy. I repeat, this is not a comedy.",2017
7,"David Berkowitz. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. Ed Gein. It's fascinating how the names of some of North America's most sensationalized serial killers have their names as familiar through cross-generational age groups as George Washington, Martin Luthur King and Michael Jackson. Pop culture seems equally enamored by rampages of the more infamous multiple murderers and have dedicated innumerable television episodes, podcasts and theatrical releases to their subjects taking dramatic licenses to piece together the anatomy of a killer.",2017
9,"I'm a fan of Derf's graphic novel about his teen experiences in the late '70s with Jeff Dahmer -- as a result I had mixed feelings about a film version. On the one hand, I was excited, but on the other was quite curious how the relatively brief story could be turned into a feature length film.",2017
5,"The Midwest is incubating a monster, and he's in every club photo. A slouched posture and taboo interests define the young Dahmer. Roadkill is his closest companion, and acids are his most trusted tools. A hunger for dark meat and classmate laughs, he stages spasms to build his brand.",2017
9,Originally I would have rated this film 7 or 8 stars but I had to bump it up to 9 because it absolutely haunted my memory after watching it.,2018
9,"This is not the Dahmer you may know. Not the infamous late part of him is what I'm trying to say. Most are aware of what this man has done and while I am generally against criminals/mass murderers/crazy individuals getting the limelight of publicity and their name known in the press, Dahmer happened a long time ago and you can't change the handling of the story in hindsight. The movie also can not change what this boy will become once he grows into an adult man.",2018
6,The understanding of what may have been going through Jeffery Dahmer's head and made him what he is.,2017
7,Everybody all over the world do knows the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. This flick shows Jeffrey before his first kill. All seen through the eyes of his friend Derf Backderf. ,2018
6,"Ever since I've heard of this film I've wanted to watch it. I've never went to the Film Festivals and when I saw these good ratings on this film I HAD to see it. To my surprise this film didn't succeed in beating The Babadook or The Witch. It didn't feel much emotion based and they kinda forgot about the bullied kid who wanted to give Jeff Dahmer tickets to a concert. The acting was B-Movie acting and feeling was bland. It still seemed somewhat entertaining with Jeffrey Dahmer being Jeffrey Dahmer and the suspense killed me.
I rate this a 6/10 because it was definitely almost as good as Jeepers Creepers and it strives in the biography catagory. 
The first half was great but the last sorta just slowed down time.
I would love to see this film have a theatrical release, audiences would give it a 5.7/10 and would say it is as bad as Jigsaw with nothing new from a movie who tries to bend your mind.",2018
8,Without a single murder this movie about the high school years of Dahmer turned out to be surprisingly well made and scary. Knowing what happens later there is a distubring tension throughout at every quirk and eccentricity that the nerdy teen dispays. At first he seems like a typical teen but then he has friends - he isn't a loner or violent. The obsession with dead animals and road kill is quite ghastly again knowing what it leads to. His seizure pranks are actually quite funny.,2018
9,"Imagine a man with the shaman-like charisma and borderline madness of Jim Morrison (at least as he was depicted in Oliver Stone's film 'The Doors') but equipped with the vicious fighting skills of Wolverine. Add to that the intellect and strategic talents of Francis Underwood from 'House of Cards' as well as a - very large - dose of trauma induced mental problems (especially mother issues; well: some sister issues as well) – and you've almost got James Keziah Delaney (Tom Hardy), the central character of the new show 'Taboo'. And let me tell you: he just so happens to be one of the most compelling and original protagonists I've seen in a TV-show since Ian McShane blessed us with the character of Al Swearengen in 'Deadwood' (ok, there was that other guy from that cooking show, you know: 'Baking Bread' or something like that - he was pretty singular too).",2017
10,"Obviously it's not hard to see why, with Tom Hardy leading...",2017
10,Excellent!,2017
9,"There can't be a better start to 2017. After the first episode I am sure most of them viewers are hooked. Why won't they? Taboo is a cinematic experience. Everything is so detailed the costumes, the sets, the locations , the music, the characters. You can't expect more from a TV series. ",2017
10,"Apparently Tom Hardy lost a few million on this one. I find it hard to believe. Perhaps the person who did the calculations only took into account how the show did on its mother channel on TV in the UK. But that's just the beginning of its story, I would say, because there is streaming and DVDs and foreign sales... A lot of people prefer to stream stuff because it's more convenient. A fixed TV time isn't always a good time to watch something. I'm pretty sure Hardy knew what he was doing, and anyway, it's just not freakin' possible that this show isn't gonna do amazingly well around the world. NO WAY.",2017
10,"The first season of this show is excellently written and directed. Tom Hardy does an outstanding job. The historical material is an educator's dream, but the content is a school teacher's nightmare! Every taboo is broken, and in pre-Victorian England, that's a lot of taboos! ",2017
10,"The name says it all and is the best show on TV. So many great lines, ""they're my rocks now"". The dark and foreboding tone is intoxicating. A mix of history with a poetic twist and family intrigue. Sex, violence, politics, crime, corruption, witchcraft, spies, it is unyielding! The story line defies logic. It is the best written and acted show I have seen in some time. The writing is superb. I am hooked. Hope this gets renewed and not just a one season show. We don't watch primetime and always look for something ""smart"". This show is just that. It draws you in with the history angle but the back story and the current situation make you root for James Delaney. As his life went awry from the start, his experiences in life have molded him into the person he is today. A man who is completely undone, yet cunning and smart. A planner. A doer. A man who is determined to get what is his at all costs and make others pay. Thank you!",2017
10,This show is easily some of Tom Hardy's best work.,2017
10,"Not much on television worth watching nowadays so it is a very pleasant surprise when a series of this caliber comes along. The depiction of 1800s Great Britain in all it's steamy vulgarity and corruption is intriguing and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott and Tom Hardy are at their outstanding best. The production quality and scenery is first rate. The acting throughout is of a rare quality in today's market. Tom Hardy does not disappoint in his character portrayal as the lead character. Mystery, treachery, intrigue and darkness are present in abundance in the first three episodes I have watched thus far. The reach of the East India company with its unscrupulous pursuit of power and wealth by any means has me drawn in. I cannot wait for the next episode! At a time when the majority of television series seem to be filled with political propaganda disguised as entertainment this series stands out. Nothing pc to see here. Excellent!!",2017
10,"Taboo is an excellent addition to the series of 2017, something which says a lot by itself. The characters and the scenes are all superb and enticing. I must recommend this TV series to all the fans of historical series, especially those who are interested in the happening of the West India Company. The characters are also all so humane that you can see the faults and the mistakes of each of them, without them being glorified by the development of the scenario. A warning though is necessary as the show contains some inappropriate language and graphic scenes that include sex. It is inappropriate for children under the 12 maybe 15 years old. (That last statement is my own personal suggestion and can vary according to the various ethic codes each culture has).",2017
10,"I know this is in its first season, but I'm blown away with the performances and cast and sets that these crews have done. The story line is edgy and keeps me wanting more, I look forward to more seasons of Taboo; I love that the main character James Delaney has flash backs and what appears to be some type of gift of a 6th sense to communicate with spirits & see things / communicate through fire as James Delaney is half native Indian / Métis and has absorbed other cultures. I'm not sure if this TV Series is completely fiction or loosely based on a true story (I haven't done my research). I applaud the writers that put this together either way so far so good, this TV series is amazing and one to watch out for at award shows. Great Job 10 out of 10",2017
10,"Taboo is a dark, devilish, delightful, psycho supernatural thriller. ",2017
10,Many people might not have liked taboo because it's not your normal action series. This one's a dark and gritty drama. Its one of it's kind and the taboo team is really intelligent. The plot itself is a simple one but gets complicated. ,2017
3,Like Peaky Blinders before it Taboo was very much a case of style over substance.,2017
6,"It could be a great show if not for the ""poor"" writing, a ""cliche"" plot, and ""meaningless"" cliffhangers. If a show has Tom Hardy as lead, it is certain he isn't gonna die, maybe, till the end. Yet, the first two episodes tried, in vain, to build the tension where the Crown, and Company were after his life. Come on! He won't die, we know it. Can we move on with the story?",2017
4,"Sorry, Tom. I love you. But, Taboo is so zzz. I gave you three episodes but I wont be watching again. Not sure what is worse: your accent that keeps changing between English, Irish and American, the fact you're trying to pull off a modern day haircut in nineteenth century London, Mark Gatiss in the fat suit as the Prince Regent which just makes me think his episodes are off cuts from Little Britain, or the fact the show is so slow and dull. I've been looking forward to Taboo for about three years. Disappointed is an understatement. Let's face it, if Tom Hardy wasn't in this, the ratings on here wouldn't be anywhere near where they are and most viewers would have switched off by now. Sorry, but don't waste your time watching this. Yawnfest. Zzzzzzzz.",2017
10,"As a film critic I am delighted with the atmosphere of the this TV cinema. Exactly cinema!Sound design! And of course acting. Hardy's ""Hmm"", and Franka, in unusual role. Really delight!",2017
10,"The first episode was superb.I can't wait for the next episode. Fantastic filmography, acting, makeup and costumes. Technically perfect. Vancouver was referenced several times both verbally and through the map. I am definitely not a pedant - in fact I have a very low threshold for attention to detail. However the City of Vancouver which was named after the brilliant and tragic English adventurer, explorer and diplomat George Vancouver, was not incorporated (or named) in his honour until 1886 and as this episode is placed firmly in the year of 1814 it would seem that the main character James Delaney besides being broody, moody and in touch with the supernatural is in fact also a remarkable soothsayer.",2017
10,"What a superb start to the series! The acting was top-notch, especially the powerful performance from Tom Hardy (would you expect anything else), and the look of early 19th century London certainly seemed to be spot on for a layman like myself. One point to note, though, in reply to Ian Cunningham's review, is that it was Vancouver Island that was referenced and not the city. The island was given that name some 20-odd years before the events of the show, so no soothsaying was required! Anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of the series and just hope it manages to maintain the standard throughout, especially considering how high the bar has been set!",2017
8,Finally I came to see this Gothic gem from the BBC and I am not disappointed - quite the contrary is the case.,2017
2,"I've watched as much of this nonsense as I can take. It's painful. Tom Hardy, Britains answer to the bloody awful Kevin Costner, grumbles his way through this overly produced crap-fest.",2017
10,"So...I just watched episode one of taboo on fx, and I am extremely excited too see where this show goes.... So far, it is excellent. I read a lot of reviews commenting that it "" was slow"" or "" starts off very boring"", but I cannot disagree more. This series is very clearly a very complex and detailed story. I can't say enough good things about Tom Harry's performance. Tom hardy is one of the very best actors of the decade, hands down. His acting is extraordinary. There are very few shows that hold The viewers attention the way that taboo does, and this is, after only one episode. Can't wait to see what happens next! This is a great start to 2017 for television, and I can only hope that more shows come out this year that are the caliber of Taboo.",2017
10,"Cinematography pallet of an 1800's portrait painting. Acting talent featuring world class character actors. Drama driven story with ..Tom Hardy...Oona Chaplin. Oh my! Executive producer Ridley Scott had me immediately engaged. What will keep me watching is seriously amazing period drama with hints of the Pre Columbian and African occult, multinational / continental plot aspects, and established talent portraying the characters.",2017
10,"I wouldn't usually review anything on IMDb, but this show based on the first episode is extremely well done and I only wish it was on Netflix so I could just binge watch it all in one go! I felt it captured the gritty nature of 19th century London brilliantly (I assume as I've actually never been to 19th century London). The only caveat for me is that it appears it has a supernatural theme that I can only assume will become more relevant as the story unfolds. I'm not a huge fan of supernatural stuff, but so far it's been done very tastefully so I'm not too concerned. There are a few recognizable actors throughout, but Tom Hardy as per usual steals the show.",2017
9,"I can't praise this gem any more highly. It's funny as heck. And it's got such a deliciously dark sense of humor. I love it. This certainly won't be everybody's cup of tea - but it's fun, fun, fun. I can't wait for next week. This show reminds me that Chris. M. can act, and the writers are pushing the limits with cutting edge edginess that they wouldn't even have tried getting past the censors even a few years ago. Don't let the 'imaginary' stuffed blue unicorn fool you - this is NOT for kids.",2017
8,"Adapted from Grant Morrison's novel. Happy is the tale of Nick Sax an ex-cop who has fallen off the wagon(or cliff), as he's contracted to kill a couple of the mobs men. But when Mike tells Nick about a password he's not suppose to know, Nick finds himself in the cross hairs of some dangerous people. As if that wasn't enough he starts seeing a flying unicorn(you read that right) and naturally he thinks it's a hallucination, but as the story progresses he realizes that Happy is so much more then that. The story is crazy and that is the hook. I loved it, it's definitely not for everyone. The best aspect of the series was the screenplay, it's so refreshing. Gave the story a fast a pace. I loved the voice over from Patton Oswalt. If you are a fan of dark humor, stop what you're doing and watch this. Happy is a cult classic in the making.",2017
10,"A washed-up hit-man (played by the great Christopher Maloni), an animated wise-cracking horse and everything at least co- written by f-ing Grant Morrison? TAKE MY MONEY!!!! The first Episode is really well done, cuts, camera and soundtrack are neatly on point, really makes hungry for more!",2017
10,"Easily the best show I've seen this year, I could hardly breathe I was laughing so hard. If you love dark comedy then this show is for you.!!",2017
10,"This was brilliant! Bloody, hysterical & featuring Patton Oswalt as a blue unicorn. Chris Meloni is SUCH a great actor & this insanity is so me it's scary :)",2017
10,Unbelievably funny. Maloni is awesome ! A darl quirky Noir-ish comedy action definitely not for those with unrefined senses of humor.,2017
10,"...I was laughing so hard I could not catch my breath! I knew that Meloni had a humorous side to him after watching ""Wet Hot American Summer"", however; after watching this first episode of ""HAPPY!"" I think that he should just do comedies from here on out. Meloni plays an ex disgraced cop who is apparently a hit man now, albeit a drug addled alcoholic one that has a heart prone to explode real soon, with a death wish. I do not want to give anything away but if you like dark, bloody comedies this is for you.",2017
10,"I have only seen the first couple episodes of this show and it is awesome. It is hilarious on many levels. The acting is great. The writing is great. The violent, over the top action is great. The story is great. Patten Oswald is perfect as the imaginary friend. Christopher Meloni, the main character, is going to be remembered for this role the rest of his acting career. He plays his character perfect. Honestly, this has to be one of the best shows on television. I can't recall ever seeing another show like this, ever. Seriously. This is going to have a cult following for sure. Just watch the first episode and enjoy the ride into the absurdly, hilarious-violent-madness.",2017
9,"Like others have said, this show is not for everyone. It's crude, dark, vile and nasty, but if you have a dark sense of humor, this is the funniest politically incorrect show I have seen in a long time. Keep in mind it was based on a comic, and the visuals feel like it jumped right off the page on to the screen.",2017
9,I had heard things good and bad about this show so I figured I would try it out and to my surprise I was happy no pun intended; that I watched it had loads of action laughs and even a little heart so far while as far as content goes its strong dirty and graphic 'even some partial nudity and extreme violence and swearing galore it was a nice show for parents and older teens cant wait to see more pieces and I for one adored happy the horse he was a hilarious riot,2017
9,"I watched the first episode. It's dark, gritty, violent, and humorous show, with plot twists and mystery. The show's pacing is good. It doesn't jump around scenes as many modern shows do, thinking their audience suffers from ADHD, with need to overwhelm your brain with information or they risk losing your attention. There's a small indication that the show will delve into the supernatural, but I could be wrong. Either way I enjoyed it and looking forward to future episodes.",2017
9,"I normally like light hearted comedies and sci fi / fantasy type programmes. I don't really like comic book based series or horror or gore or anything like that. However this has just enough of everything to satisfy everyone, but not so much that it would put off people like myself. It has just enough gore, just enough violence, just enough comedy, just enough drama, just enough sci-fi and fantasy and just enough comic book tales - combined with excellent acting, a great script and decent visuals - this makes this programme a great all rounder suitable for pretty much everyone.",2017
7,"All those on here giving this poor rating because of the acting or story, need to realise it is not trying to be Oscar winning material.",2017
9,"Just what I needed! Smart, funny, adventurous and twisted!!! Awesome!",2017
10,A great addition to the violence game. Extremely creative and respects the genre. A great formula. ,2017
10,"I haven't been so pleased with any newly created shows I felt so strongly I had to add to my list. Then episode two came out an I simply had to review it for others to see. So far I'd not change a single thing. It's wildly creative an just as funny, yet somehow they've injected action, drama, a sense of sadness, and that's just the tip of it. ;) Anyways I didn't want to be a spoiler so with what I've written above just take it n trust me. If u have a sense of humor, like action, n are sick of all these crap shows then WATCH THIS ONE CAUSE ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!",2017
10,"You know this shows, e.g. UK comedy when you need to watch a 2 or 3 episodes to understand ""it""? Well this show doesn't keep you waiting and is absolutely great from the very beginning and it doesn't mean that it's not sophisticated. I was a bit sceptical during first couple of scenes but after what happened in hospital I simply felt in love with it and could NOT wait for the next episode which turned out to be even funnier. This is absolutely my fav type of humour, dark and sarcastic, shows like ""Ghosted"" are based on those small talks which happen in inappropriate and/or dangerous moments somehow don't work for me but here it's taken to the next level and I L.O.V.E. it! Hence the whole brutality which while being super evil remains funny too - it is just great
I highly recommend it to anyone who likes dark and sarcastic pastiche.",2017
9,I watched the first episode of this show and I loved it the humor was funny the action level was high and full force I love the twists and turns around every corner just a super fun time and happy the horse is really funny just a wonderful new show just please don't let your kids watch this it has very strong blood and swearing even sex and a little nudity but I cant wait for more,2017
10,Exceptionally smart and twisted. Must watch padt episode 1. You'll be hooked.,2018
9,"After watching the first episode i was instantly hooked. The story line is simple, missing child, alcoholic ex cop, mob bosses and an imaginary blue unicorn, the usual.
The comedy is spot on with cheesy lines and action which come off not being cheesy at, surprising easter eggs (such as a subtle 'the shining' reference)
Over all i love this show, its only up too the fourth episode at the writing of this review and i look forward too the rest.",2018
9,Ok this starts out about a little girl going to see a show and then this sicko dressed as Santa come and kidnaps her and she must be rescued 'ok end of story ' now for my review .I for one loved the show it moved very fast and was action & humor packed and I haven't got to see the next episode yet but I hope for the best . as far as content goes there is graphic violence constant swearing and even partial nudity a side of a breast during a sexual act but aside from that if you can handle the content its a wonderful show I recommend it,2017
7,"It had some funny, some gore, some action, a little crime, and a bit of policing. I'm not into the story though, not my idea of a good plot. I'll be watching, hoping the story evolves past the current characters driving it. I'm really hoping the girl leads to the bigger story quickly.",2017
10,"Happy! is funny, dark, action-packed and the story has a lot of heart. I always liked Chris Meloni - now, I love him!",2017
8,If you like weirdly directed stuff such as Legion and stuff like that then you should give this a shot. It's a basic procedural cop show but it's like half the cast and crew were tripping on acid when they made it. I loved it but it might not be for everyone.,2017
9,"Excelent humour, that little amount of extra blood we need, mixed with comedy and as a cherry of a pie, an imaginary innocent friend who will rethink what it think about people as time goes by along the main character.
The only thing that keeps ringing in my mind is the similitude to Max Payne...even that black dressed co-worker-lover is just like Mona Sax....wait a minute...Sax!!",2018
4,"I knew i would not like this movie when *SPOILER* it was nonchalantly mentioned jesse (skylar astin) and beca (anna kendrick) had broken up and he'd moved on way too quick. way to character assassinate. it just got worse from there. rebel wilson is a comedic actress, but too much of her is just obnoxious and that is what this movie is-obnoxious. i rarely laughed and i didn't recognize most songs they sang. i must be getting old. i have to say my favorite in the series is 2. there is no puking i have to fast forward through. and beca and jesse's cuteness makes up for everything else. elizabeth banks and john michael higgins are hilarious as always. basically, this movie only gets four stars because of who is in it, not for its story.",2018
7,"I got tired of the Fat Amy jokes real quick in the first two flicks, so I had low expectations going into this one. Can't anybody figure out what to do with Rebel Wilson's talent instead of relying on her weight as a, well, ""fallback"" strategy ? Finally, at lest they tried to get beyond the Fat Girl jokes and physical ""humor."" There's less music, but more ""substance"" to the plot. Silly, yes, but a plot nonetheless, that has nothing to do with music competitions. And when the Bellas are facing Certain Death, it's Fat Amy that comes to the rescue, and in a way that makes her weight an advantage instead of a handicap. I do wish there'd'a been more music, but at least there was less Fat Girl nonsense.",2018
10,"If you loved the first 2 movies like me you'll enjoy this 
just go see it and stop reading reviews from people who were not into the first two movies to begin with.",2017
7,"I wasn't expecting too much so I went to the cinema with an open mind. However, I was only about 3 minutes into this film and I could feel the quality and feel of it was a whole lot better than the last. ",2017
10,If you like any of the other pitch perfect films then youll love this,2018
3,"Why I ask you? Why oh why oh why oh why oh why do the scriptwriters of Pitch Perfect 3 - Kay Cannon (the original PP screenwriter) and Mike White (""The Emoji Movie"") - think that this dreadfully lazy set of loosely connected scenes represent a viable basis for a movie? Is the view from the guys who green-lit this thing that the crowd that loved ""Pitch Perfect"" and the pretty dreadful sequal ""Pitch Perfect 2"" will pay their box office money regardless? Let's advertise the hell out of it and cash in our chips before word of mouth gets out!?",2017
1,"It's unwatchable. Poorly written, full of cliches and nonsense. Women deserve better movies, sorry ! The first one was a little gem but after that, studios just wanted to grab a lot of money and the following movies kept getting worse and worse. Rent it later if you want but don't feed anymore those greedy studios who disrespect the audience.",2017
10,"If you were a fan of the first Pitch Perfect movie and were disappointed by the bloated sequel, you'll find Pitch Perfect 3 to be acc-awesome. I saw all three movies back-to-back-to-back at the Pitch Perfect Treble feature so I was able to put them into fresh context.",2017
1,"Plot was empty and frivolous with an addition of an unnecessary Fat Amy plot line, a homophobic unnecessary romance that didn't make any sense (not to mention the queerbaiting @universal movies did to snatch lgbt fans' money), and the blasted script wasted the potential the girls had to showcase solely women power instead of crumbling inserting a love story for Chloe that didn't make any sense.",2017
2,"Well me and my gf went to the movies last night and went to see this mess 
now where do i start well like all crap movies they have to have some plot that well dont really matter at first off there was really no plot except the two idiots that followed them around and be like ya were filing ur documentry and the women were like they were not even aware of it (i dono dont ask) second the plot where fat amy had her father going around and trying to be all mr nice guy but he was really after her money she had...and thats pretty much the movie it had a lot of stupid dancing and crap dancing OMG the stang off scene just never ended it was almost 30 mins of everyone doing some stupid thing or another and totally sucked with it all i had no idea what hell was going on.......
the movie was not at all funny and it just felt like there was way too much 
thing going on that felt they should have not added ",2018
10,"Every pitch perfect movie I have watched I have enjoyed just as much as the last one as there own individual differences. These movies are all so unique and me personally love the pitch harmony, who doesn't right !!! My inspiration has been Rebel Wilson since I first saw her in PP1 and now she has just inspired me even more in the last movie with her comedian ways. This is another excellent movie that has been produced and honestly I don't know why they would stop other than the fact that they would have to change characters but these series of movies are different from any other and I love everything about them. If I could I would love to get the opportunity to be apart of a movie like this when I am older.",2018
5,"What did I just watch? 
Seriously this movie is not at all what I expected. 
The first act is pretty entertaining and sets up an interesting premise where the Bella's have to compete with real bands using instruments. 
This plot is almost completely abandoned however when the movie decides to become an action movie with a hostage situation. 
There is a severe tonal problem with this movie but I can't say I didn't have fun with certain aspects and scenes. This movie will probably satisfy Pitch Perfect super fans but doesn't offer much other than ""what if Pitch Perfect was John Wick?"". This film has no where near the fun or heart of the previous instalments and I wouldn't seek it out but it's not without merit either.",2018
8,"As the critics claimed, the final installment of the Pitch Perfect series was very predictable, scattered all over the places and inconsistent. However, if you viewed it like I did - as a farewell instead of a usual movie - it's really good. Everything was coming to an end and the end was, rather emotionally, not enough to make people sob, but still it was a sad farewell.
The music was... not bad. I loved most of the music, but some were kind of scattered and confusing, ie the final song. With the heavy instruments in the background, I could hardly hear the Bellas. 
But all in all, it was a great movie and will definitely add to my collection of Pitch Perfect DVDs",2018
7,"If you love the Pitch Perfect series then you'll likely enjoy this one too. Theres some cringey/cheesy moments but also plently of laughs. The story doesnt stray too far from the first 2. It starts off with the Bellas down on their luck and they have to come together to regain their former glory. However, there was a B sideplot involving Fat Amy's dad and I kind of wish the film was more of that. One of my favourite scenes was Fat Amy kicking ass on that yacht (while still taking the time to eat a sandwich). It was so funny, but also just a different and refreshing way to take the series.

5,"Movies not originally written as a multipart series struggle to avoid a natural decline in entertaining power. The Anna Kendrick series offers a textbook example of this cinematic principle. The nerdy acapella jokes which made the original refreshing feel stale, you've seen the song battle with unusual singing groups (e.g., the Green Bay Packers) before, the big movie-ending showdown is more ritual than riveting. To its credit the movie breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge some of these tropes most insightfully when Beca explains the impromptu sing-offs and then mentions that they always seem to lose them. Like the 2nd outing the movie could have used some editing particularly around a B plot involving John Litghow as Fat Amy's father. The gravity of sequel physics might have made #2 the bail out point if not for one man - the incomprarable DJ Khalid. The possibly genius / possibly raving idiot quote machine gets a hilarious scene where he spouts inpenetrable DJ Khalid philosphy why an assistant translates for the audience (""what DJ Khalid means here is you need to let go of the anchor of the past if you want to rise to your future."") Nobody has yet heard the first 2 or 3 lines following the scene as movie-goers were still gaffawing. In short, when will DJ Khalid get his own movie?",2018

7,"After facing countless acapella competitions in the first two films, Christmas 2017 marks the last journey of Beca and her 'family' Barden Bellas singing together. This time, however, Barden Bellas wouldn't face another acapella team in an acapella competition. As a matter of fact, there is a little part of competition atmospheres (only when the Barden Bellas are playing with rip-off game with another bands) as this third installment focuses on things that much more important than winning any competition, which is to moving on to the next stage of our life. Beca is frustated with her job as music producer because she couldn't do what she thinks the best for musician's music. This is why she quits her job and agrees to go on a tour with other Barden Bellas members who also don't satisfy with their current life. Fat Amy meets her father again and thinks that he has changed so that they can live happily together like they used to be. Both Beca and Fat Amy are trapped within the past, they want to relive the past which is seemingly happier than present time and the future. And throughout Pitch Perfect 3, audience would be learning with them that someone could create their future without completely leaving the past behind (Beca would still have her 'family' even though she accepted DJ Khalid's offer).",2017
5,"I'm a very masculine dude so I wouldn't have seen it unless my girlfriend hadn't asked me to see it when I took her out for date night. Feminist comments aside, this movie was just god awful. The dialogue was less than adequate, the general plot was far fetched, and their attempt to seem like a cool movie was all for nothing.",2018
10,"after reading reviews on here, i am just totally flabbergasted. the first review that came up was horrible. this show is amazing. it is hilarious, and heart wrenching. the comedy is well timed and funny, the serious parts are meaningful and relate to my childhood. i can say that this show is worth watching and beautiful. i don't understand why anyone would discredit it. i cant wait for more. it is so meaningful and soulful. it shows love and family and a hilarious humor. i can only imagine that if someone gives this show a bad review, that they don't understand its underlying meaning and that makes me sad for them. it is one of the best shows i have seen in a long time and i will be anxiously awaiting the next season.",2017
9,"I think the negative reviews here are thinking about Netflix's general output instead of the genre this show is meant for. I personally have never seen the original, but I find this to breathe new life into the typical family sitcom genre. It's tackling modern issues but is steeped in traditional family values and I think that's a very important aspect for a modern sitcom. It's styled in a very old school way, but thematically it is embracing all factors of humanity without pandering or talking down to the audience, and I value that as a viewer. If you compare it to say House of Cards or OITNB then yes of course it won't stack up, but put it against 8 Simple Rules or Fresh Prince Of Bel Air and it does very well.",2017
10,"I started watching this show because I was bored and wanted to just have something on TV while I worked and found myself overcome with emotions. This show is amazing and I can't wait until the next season debuts. It kept me laughing, thinking, and even crying. It is a great series and the only negative thing I have to say is that there weren't enough episodes. Netflix could help me out a lot by adding 26 episodes a season instead of their typical 13. I watched the entire serious in a few short hours and now want to make sure that this show continues. In all honesty this show was more intriguing to me than many other Netflix sitcoms as well as some other shows like George Lopez.",2017
10,"As a Latina, it's incredible all the different ways I can see myself and my family in this show. The show is funny but also progressive. It's exactly what a Latinx show needs. These ideas aren't often portrayed in Latinx media and the fact that the show hits just about all the major topics on the head deserves so much credit. Feminism has such a bad rep, but this show puts a good face to it. It's finally a reboot that does exactly what it needs to do; It keeps the love of the original show, but adds modern changes not only physically, but also in their plot lines. It brings to light social issues that modern, popular shows don't touch upon. Truly worth the watch and features fantastic actors who take on their characters like themselves.",2017

10,"Every once in a while a sitcom comes around that really catches audiences attention. I think One Day at a Time is one that's really needed at this point in time. I was raised with a mix of Puerto Rican and Dominican culture and I grew up with a lot of the same customs used in this show. I think the characters are relatable regardless of race or ethnicity and a lot of the issues surrounding them are broad and multicultural. Sure it has its cliché moments, but what's a sitcom without them. I would be really disappointed if Netflix were to cancel this one. Regardless of who watches it, I believe everyone can find something in it that's relatable to their own lives. It's a win for me.",2017
10,"I think in the last couple of years this was definitely one of the best sitcoms I have watched. The show found a great balance between being funny, and yet tackling serious topics such as PTSD, sexism or coming out, having really great heartfelt moments, while handling the transition between light and somber very smoothly. The actors' portrayal is all amazing, and so are the characters and their arcs, especially the main three women. ",2017
10,"One Day at a time esta muy buena me gusto mucho, muchos temas tratados y bastante entretenida. Dia a Dia this is a very good TV series, love the way that it shows a lot of things like the way that veterans are dealing with medical service, about therapy, homosexuality, immigration, about the situation of veterans in civil life so crude and sad, i just like this TV show !!and wishing that i can see another season The actors are great, Penelope and Lydia so fantastic the way that they interact with everyone else, Schneider is so cute! even Victor is so cute, Dr Berkowitz so naive. It really makes me laugh and cry, most of all the last chapter, the final when Elena's family surround her with their support.",2017
7,"Honestly, this show was better than I expected it to be. The characters are funny and the writing is really well done. You have to judge it on a ""sitcom"" scale and in that spectrum this show is very high quality. It can get cliché sometimes but that is to be expected.",2017
10,"A ""laugh track"" is when a sit-com, not filmed in front of an audience, employs a machine to artificially add laughter to the show.",2017
8,"I started watching this, expecting it to be tacky, but quite liked it. They dealt with some sensitive issues, things I could relate to, even though I am not Latina. Didn't really notice the laugh track others mentioned and certainly think it is better than Fuller House. This isn't a remake of the old show, its a new show with the same title. As for the reviewer who said the characters or actors don't seem to connect, I disagree. I think they did great for a first season with a new show...take a look back at some of your favourites, compare the first year to the last...even Friends in the beginning seemed like random characters pulled of paper and forced unto a set. I didn't love every episode, but it stroked my curiosity enough to keep watching and to hope for new episodes.",2017
2,"I admit, I've only watched two episodes now, so perhaps it get better. But so far it hasn't. I would tend to agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned the laugh track. It really does seem like it's there, much like the old generation laugh tracks, to tell you that you're supposed to laugh. Unfortunately, I haven't found much to laugh at. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of small chuckles here and there, but nothing I'd call funny.",2017
4,"New TV shows with laugh tracks don't seem new at all. I am not sure why laugh tracks were ever popular with the show producers, but the better shows have long since cast them aside. Shows with laugh tracks seem crippled somehow, as if they can't get you to laugh at their jokes, they will laugh at their own.",2017
2,"This isn't a sit com at all. It's just a platform for a bunch of scriptwriters who are clearly better social justice warriors than they are writers. Each episode takes an issue - racism, gender dysphoria, homophobia, etc, etc - and proceeds to simply preach the writers' point of view, dividing a very stilted lecture up into supposed dialogue. Very rarely is it in any way funny, but the canned laughter will at least tell you when it was supposed to be. Barely even tolerable as background whilst doing something else. As a show to actually sit down and watch it's a non-starter.",2018
1,The amount of propaganda and anti-white sentiments in this show...truly profound.,2018
7,"I've just attended a film festival where Norman Lear was featured. He mentioned being involved in this series so I decided to take a peak. The three female leads are all quite good though they are portraying Cubans who they are not, and that helps because Latinos are tired of being represented by Cubans. ",2017
3,"One Day At A Time, a classic Norman Lear series of the 70s and this Netflix reboot have one thing in common - the laugh track, and that is all. The politically correct Cuban American series desperately needs the laugh track to let the viewer know that i joke is supposed to be at the moment it is not happening. ",2017
2,"Growing up with 60s,70s,80s & 90s TV sucked because 1 reason LAUGHTRACKS.so why bring it back? Your supposed to be fresh and new, setting the bar higher, not taking steps backwards. Even if the show could have had legs you made me watch something else the moment your forced laughs on me... sorry. Learn from past mistakes don't embrace them. PPL don't need to be told when to laugh. Netflix has been nailing it with so many great new shows,Narcos,Stranger Things, Black Mirror etc.. so why put your name on something that obviously failed with television? ......(I'm done putting my two cents in but IMDb is making me write a review with a minimum of 10 lines, ALSO annoying:)",2017
10,"Netflix did it again, this show was heartfelt, funny and hit today's real issues. Rita Moreno is a magnificent actress. She makes her character a real Abuela. All the cast has great chemistry, they did a great job. The best sitcom in years. It is very well written, warm and funny. I don't agree with the other reviews on the negative feedback on the laugh track, it was not overdone and it was not to much. I truly enjoyed watching this show, I hope they make more seasons, and more than just 13 episodes. I think they did the reboot of the show justice, so far Netflix as not disappointed me with they original shows. Great job!!",2017
8,"I have really enjoyed this show. The characters are well developed, it's pretty funny and I love the way it approaches serious issues. The show does a great job telling a personal story while weaving in issues such as equal pay for women, veterans services and struggling with sexuality. All of these issues are current and important and this show brings them to the forefront to get us all thinking. My favorite character is Abuelita, she is hilarious and fun to watch. The show is very relate able, as there is at least one issue that all of us have been impacted by. Great job Netflix on picking up an original show with some depth. Highly recommend!",2017
9,"Netflix has a good reputation in my house for producing great original shows. This remake was entertaining, and it expertly updated the original plot to address modern concerns while maintaining the original charm. Penelope is a wonderful lead as a military veteran, nurse, and mother. She's in charge of caring for her two children with the aid of her mother and some help from the building landlord.",2017

Not funny, artificial, I feel sorry for These stupid people They love this",2018
7,"For the most part, the show is funny and hits difficult topics. I see the attempt to stay true to Veteran problems and the family is pretty good at keeping Cuban culture in the house, though i believe none of the cast is Cuban. Some episodes (scripts) don't seem to stay true to the character. Rita Moreno does a fantastic job playing the Cuban grandmother, but in the episode ""Roots"" she lacks on keeping to who she should be. Majority of Cubans are proud to be in America and equally be proud to be American. Difficult decision to renounce citizenship of Cuba is valid but they could have changed it up. The episode left you not knowing who Lydia or Penelope voted for which was fine with me, in this Trump voter bashing culture, I can see why this show doesn't go as far as Tim Allen's 'Last Man Standing'. Lydia would have been the perfect pro-Trump Cuban in the house, and this would have brought better conflict on the show between characters. Cuban's are not Puerto Rican's or Mexican's, you cannot base their character's in that light. If the show continues, (which i hope it does, I am a fan of all the characters) I hope the writers do a better job researching the politics of Cuban's. There is a huge reason why Lydia's generation of Cuban would have voted for Trump. I think the show should be a bit more bold in this political climate and it should stay true to that.",2018
5,"I really liked the first season, but the second one was a bit disappointing to me. I kind of felt that the jokes are forced, not so funny and sometimes a bit out of place. I found the acting of the leading actress (Justina Machado) a bit exaggerated, she was kind of overacting. At some point I just couldn't focus on the jokes or the story, because most of the time I was distracted by the overblown acting. Rita Moreno, Stephen Tobolowsky and Todd Grinnell were quite good though. If there is ever gonna be a third season, I am not planning on watching it.",2018

9,One might not think that a city so divided that what you call it identifies which side of the divide you are would be the first choice of where to locate a comedy; especially if it was set at a time when there were troops on the streets and the threat of sectarian violence was very real but somehow 'Derry Girls' works. As anybody in the UK or Ireland would guess this follows a group of Catholic girls in the city of Derry in Northern Ireland (had they been protestant it would no doubt have been called 'Londonderry Girls). The humour is such that people of whatever persuasion are likely to find it equally funny/offensive. ,2018

The supporting cast are also excellent, Grandad Joe in particular I thought was very funny. I laughed a lot throughout the series and it also handled some sensitive subjects very well. I am glad that it's already been confirmed we will have a series 2!",2018
9,"A lot can happen in a 30 minute sit-com, and Derry Girls is no exception.
The comedy performances, writing and production is spot-on, slo-mo and steadycam shots of mundane action backed with awesome 90's choons (and Whigfield). I like it, maybe you will too.
Notable episodes are #3 and #4, when our gang chase the dead-ringer of Erin's dog, Toto, into church and to witness a miracle involving Our Sacred Lady investigated by a dashing Priest, and when the Children of Chernobyl visit Derry, which could take them out of the frying pan and into a different frying pan.
Great cast, some pretty decent character-driven humour (including the older generations) and an interesting take on the setting and period make for a great formula, not too burdened by PC or a political agenda.",2018

9,Very few directors have tapped the clown in Tom Cruise the way Doug Liman has. He had directed Tom in Edge of Tomorrow which was humorous and was set amidst a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.,2017
9,"If you ask anyone to list the top 10 film actors, chance is that ""Tom Cruise"" would make many people's lists. He's in everything isn't he?  Well, actually, no. Looking at his IMDb history, he's only averaged just over a movie per year for several years. I guess he's just traditionally made a big impact with the films he's done. This all rather changed in the last year with his offerings of the rather lacklustre ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (FFF) and the pretty dreadful ""The Mummy"" (Ff) as one of this summer's big blockbuster disappointments. So Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was sorely in need of a upward turn and fortunately ""American Made"" delivers in spades.",2017

After the disaster that's THE MUMMY, Tom Cruise returns to form with some of his best work in the last 10 years outside the Mission Impossible franchise. Its a story based on the real life events of Barry Seal, a pilot who plays a crucial role in the Iran-Contra Affair, here we see Tom Cruise return to familiar territory where he makes us fall in love with a Semi-good guy who does bad things but we are not quite sure and root for him, because Tom Cruise makes us fall in love with him with his 1000 Watt Smile.

1,"It's naive to expect anything close to the truth from 'based-on-true-story' projects, but it shouldn't be unreasonable to hope for content and coherence. 'American Made' plays like a movie trailer throughout its two-hour length, stirring together the standard ingredients of 1980s cocaine smuggling sagas like 'Blow'. The story boils down to a procession of mustachioed Colombian cartel bosses, DEA agents and drug-courier aviators hauling cocaine, firearms and bags of cash around jungle landing strips, hotel lobbies and small town banks in the ugly fashions of the day.",2017

8,"Cruise is superb in this film, and (in my opinion) his performance captures the audience's attention throughout the film. For me Sarah Wright (the main character's wife), and Alejandro Edda (a Cartel character) also made a mark on the film, with other actors being overshadowed. All in all this was a high-octane and highly entertaining film about real-life historical events that deserved to be made. On the negative side, I would say that it glamorizes the life of Barry Seal and makes him seem like a 'nice fun guy' which is unfortunate. The real-life Barry Seal was a drug smuggler who must have cared nothing for the people who suffered as a result of his drug-running, including the numerous victims of his Cartel 'friends'.

Sure enough, Cruise's shades-wearing return to the cockpit here suggests that we're on board for another iconic role. this film is a cross between catch me if you can and jerry McGuire with show me the money?",2017
2,"It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers. ",2017
1,The humor was sophomoric.. I can't believe some of the lines being delivered by the actors. I guess if you're getting paid millions you'll concede to saying anything. ,2017
1,"I cannot believe I spent money to watch this movie in the cinema, this movie was awful. I went into the cinema expecting a comedy, but it turned out I actually went in to see an emotional character development journey with Zac Efron. It honestly was not worth it, all the funny parts of the movie can be seen in full in the trailers. I would rate the trailers 10/10 as they actually fooled me into thinking that this would be a good movie.",2017
8,"Baywatch is super cheesy, low brow, campy, ridiculous, etc, etc.....but you know what? That's enjoyable sometimes! You don't knowingly buy a ticket to a movie like this and then go write a review afterwards complaining about plot, teenage boy humour, and character development. hahaha. I had low expectations, shut my brain off at the door, and enjoyed this movie for what it was.",2017
1,"A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film.",2017
1,For the first time I actually walked out of a film before the end. ,2017
1,"Fun fact: The original TV show ""Baywatch"" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, ""Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff."" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, ""Baywatch Hawaii"", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show ""Baywatch"" would eventually become the movie ""Baywatch"" (R, 1:56), much like ""CHiPs"" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like ""CHiPs"", the big screen ""Baywatch"" sucks.",2017
1,"It seems like the studio is trying to inflate the reviews, and now I know why. The movie is not funny at all, don't waste your money. The worst part was when Efron touches a dead man's genitals, disturbing uncomfortable and unnecessary. ",2017
2,"Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.",2017
2,"When will Hollywood comedies of this decade hire writers who at least have a clue of comedy? Why hire immature morons who think the idea of a dick is funny and can replace a good script. Hollywood seems to be obsessed with male nudity and full frontal at that in this decade.If it is in the right context it could be funny but haven't seen one this decade. What happened to the writers of 40-year old virgin,knocked up,etc? This movie is a pathetic excuse for a comedy and is particularly sad since there was an opening for a new franchise which has been firmly grounded. Avoid if you are lucky and watch 'Central Intelligence' if you want to see the Rock in a good comedy!",2017
9,"I had a really great time watching this movie and I am quite glad I chose it over the Pirates of the Caribbean. There are lots of nice jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude scenes. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie. ",2017
8,"While there were a few issues that I made this movie less good, this is a decent blockbuster that's extremely entertaining.",2017
10,"Honestly, I am not sure why people are bagging on this film. Its great. The plot is fun, and runs smoothly. The comedy in this film is what sells it the most. Some of the jokes are actually great and unexpected. The others, are cheesy, on purpose, and will make you laugh regardless. Dwayne Johnson knocks it out of the park on this one. All of the cast has character, and none of them are neglected. It's a great film. I'd recommend it to everybody. Don't listen to the useless critics and pointless user reviewers with super over the top movie standards. If you wanna relax and laugh, watch this film. If you want to come in with a microscope and over analyze something in a way it wasn't meant to be analyzed, just don't come to not ruin it for others.",2017
4,"I can take a comedy that doesn't have a strong plot, just as long as it's funny. The film fails its one job, falling flat on most of its jokes (quite literally in fact, considering the first prominent joke involves a Cole Sprouse look-a-like*, played by Jon Bass, falling over)",2017
10,"This film has had so many bad reviews and I honestly don't have a clue why. I went to see this film yesterday with my mates and we absolutely loved it! It had so much to offer, funny and entertaining from beginning to end. The acting was fantastic and the actors in this really know how to keep you entertained. ",2017
8,"Mitch and his crew protect a crime ridden beach, encountering murder, drug dealing, blackmail and romance. Brody is perfectly cast and played by Zac Efron, as washed up ""vomit comet"" Olympic swimmer (Ryan Lochte esque) who blows his career by vomiting in the pool during the Olympic relay. Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new character actor, and is incredibly funny as the ""IT"" lifeguard recruit and love interest of ""slow mo"" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout. I love this kind of humour, no it's not high brow and the plot has holes but it's so much fun to watch. Recommend!",2017
8,"It's not a James Bond movie, but the drama is real!",2017
10,"Absolute laugh a minute, don't take it too seriously and you'll love it! Having seen the old Baywatch the two aren't really comparable and thats the point, they're not meant to be similar, this is a complete throw your brain away popcorn movie and that is what it should be judged on!",2017
10,Loved This Movie!!!! It was hilarious with non-stop laughs and a lot of great one-liners. Too many people are trying to turn it into what it's not. It's a comedy and delivers on that front. Didn't feel like it needed a deeper story line because that isn't the purpose of the movie. ,2017
9,"For what it is worth, it is a good movie. Plenty of decent jokes. Some vulgar jokes but very few. Some awkward jokes as well. I did enjoy it and so will you. Just a genuine movie for good laughs. The sense of humor this movie calls for is not for everyone. Still, you can enjoy this movie and I hope you do. It will not become one of your classic movies though; it is not that kind of humor at all.",2017
9,"I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!",2017
10,"I have not laughed so hard in such a longtime. Baywatch has a phenomenal cast and everything you'd want out of a comedy. I recommend this to everyone, except maybe the little ones. The entire theater was laughing their butts off, I could barely breathe!",2017
1,I've been very excited about bay watch for about 2 months or so.but after surviving 50 minutes in an early screening theater i couldn't help but going to the toilet and throwing up!! all the anticipated female sexiness turned out to be a strip show featuring zac and the rock THIS MOVIE ISN'T JUST AWFUL IT' amazes me in its way to disgust you. I recommend that you do not waste your money on this remake of 2 girls 1 cup!!,2017
8,"While extremely predictable, Baywatch lives up to what comedies are offering the viewers of today's society: laughs! Lots of laughs! There are the generic breast and penis jokes, lots of butt and boob close ups, but also genuine hilarity. ",2017
10,"Baywatch was brought back to life on the big screen after the most successful TV show in the early nineteen nineties. The show castes David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, and Pamela Anderson as one of the beautiful Baywatch babes, C. J. Parker. The movie in turn, has made people around the world feel ecstatic, heartfelt, and sometimes even anxious. In addition, several of the actors showed us each of the iconic characters in a whole new light. The movie starred Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson(as Mitch Buchannon), Zac Efron(as Matt Broody), Alexandra Daddario(as Summer Quinn), Jon Bass(as Ronnie), Ilfenesh Hadera(as Stephanie Holden), and Kelly Rohrbach(as C.J. Parker). The Hoff himself does a short cameo, along with Pamela Anderson in the film. In the first part of the movie, you see Mitch running alongside the ocean, watching everyone with eyes like a hawk. He stays calm, cool, and collect. However, Mitch still sticks to his job in a very serious manner ensuring, everything is as it should be, but with a warm touch. Later on, he gets even more assertive, as he has to deal with the brand new recruit Matt Broody, who thinks he is hot stuff because of his skill set, or the lack of. Matt Broody tries to get by with a half hearten work ethic, but fails miserably. All the while, having no knowledge of what a lifeguard is all about, and the never ending drinking habit. During which the offer lifeguards see him as some kind punk wanna be, trying to impress them. When instead, he proves he is just a total lazy butt, who craves everyone's attention. As the movie progresses, Mitch becomes more reluctant about having Matt on their team knowing he will just drop the ball again. The other lifeguards such as, Summer Quinn and Stephanie Holden even object him for a while. Broody has no respect for women, or what they do on a day to day basis to save their beach. Near the end though, he has a change of heart once he realizes the issue is much bigger than himself. I felt like the actors did an amazing job portraying their roles on screen. I definitely noticed how each character developed throughout the movie. I was also impressed with how the director, Seth Gordon, the whole crew, as well as the cast stuck to the story line the entire flick. The movie flowed smoothly from beginning to end. Also, Vaywatch had a very good message to give to the audience. Which it consists of looking out for your team, but doing it the right way, even if you have to go out of your comfort zone. In conclusion, I recommend Baywatch for people ages seventeen and older. There is language throughout, nudity, and crude adult content.",2017

4,"Since the Saw franchise is one of my biggest guilty pleasures when it comes to horror, I've been hoping for a new installment ever since The Final Chapter was supposed to end the franchise back in 2010. Even though the movies got progressively worse, there is something about this franchise that always draws me back and makes me want to re-watch it.",2017
3,"I was never a huge fan of the Saw series. I enjoyed the first one which I thought personally was a pretty excellent horror movie. However after the first film, which did have a nice theme about life, the Saw films became more and more gore over substance. In the sequels the only major factor for these films to exist were the violent traps. We had the alleged Final Chapter in 2010, but when there is a chance for the franchise to make money again, I guess it wasn't. This installment I will say is the best Saw sequel we have had up to this point (which really doesn't say much). Years after the events of the previous chapter, the Jigsaw killer has returned. However is it John Kramer or not? This is the question that the main characters of the film try to answer. However the plot is so uninteresting but also confusing, especially when keeping in mind the other chapters. I will say though continuity has never been a strength of the Saw films. The characterizations were also unimaginative, and had nothing to say. They weren't even interesting. So we have a murder mystery without a compelling story, uninteresting characters and no interesting ideas. The film doesn't even have the luxury of offering any scares. Yea sure there were the easy jump scares, but I was never shivering when seeing this. The traps are also not that gruesome, so even in that category it fails. The only thing I will say about this film is that everyone is trying. The direction is somewhat competent, all the actors are trying (some work, some don't) and they try to take Saw back to the roots of the original.",2017
4,Hollywood's cash cow advantage for Halloween. The traps were meh. Too tamed compared to other saw movies. The twist at the end was awful nearly the whole movie turns out to be one big flashback. Flashbacks are starting to become an annoying cliché both in movies and TV series. It's a sequel that didn't need to be made. I recommend not bothering with this one.,2017
1,"I'm a huge fan of the Saw series. Hell, I'm aware that 3D was bad, but at least I respected that it wrapped up the franchise well, and was only produced in less than a year.",2017
6,"As a saw geek, i thought the film was a good film for an average movie goer, but for a fan of the franchise i found it underwhelming. the ""he had another apprentice all along"" was lazy in my opinion. The idea Elanor was really Cortbett from saw 3 carrying on jigsaws work (she was around 11 yrs old in saw 3, so the age ties in 7 years on) - this would have been a far more inventive and plausible option than some random character that we are told was on the scene long before Hoffman and Amanda is too weak in my opinion. I also think, making you believe Jigsaw is alive again, only to find out it is scenes from 10 years ago is like giving a kid a Christmas present and taking it away again. However clever, leaves you disappointed. Frustrating. I understand the series needed re-inventing for the new audience, but to forget its old fan base and not have any mention at all of Hoffman, Amanda or Dr Gordon is like ordering Chocolate cake and getting trifle. whilst trifle is nice, its not what you wanted. There are certain rules in a saw film that jigsaw sticks too, well so should the producers.. even if those characters aren't appearing, they should have included someone, even if in name only, especially Dr Gordon as he was alive and well only 7yrs ago and would have known about Logan surely. All in all, a decent film. For a saw fan though its a little disappointing",2017
1,"How can you guarantee that your movie will leave as many people disappointed as possible? You create a sequel to what was an amazing franchise and then create something so kitch, so tasteless, a movie that leaves the audience struggling to relate because you put no effort into making anything of the movie even a little bit believable. I strongly believe these kinds of lazy productions should be discouraged. The bar for what gets screened is already way too low as it is.",2017
8,"""Let's Play A Game"", those simple words haunted the theaters for years, signaling the start of yet another slasher movie in the Saw series. What started out as a unique twist to the serial killer saga was only the start to a face cringing, spine tingling, sometimes nauseating saga that hooked people in until around the sixth-seventh iteration when it finally ended. That was until this year, where the saga was to be reanimated in hopes of bringing more bucks to the theaters. Will this eighth installment have the ability to defy death like it's protagonist antihero, or is it dead like the poor victims of his games. Only one way to find out and that is read my friends, so let's get started!",2017

Who knows maybe I'll have to confess giving this a 1 later, but the truth is I wanted to give it a zero so it wouldn't be watched.",2018
1,"A more appropriate title for this film would be Sorry, We Haven't Saw the First Seven Movies So We Kinda Had No Idea What the F**k We Were Doing, because clearly, the directors had clue why people like the Saw movies so much. Either that, or they didn't care. This movie lacks all the elements that define a Saw film (i.e. grotesque violence, gritty and tense atmosphere, character development, cool editing, etc). It felt like I was watching a watered down PG-13 reboot, or rather a torture porn version of the Expendables 3, minus the torture {and the porn :(}. The previous 7 films had huge cojones. The deaths were both complex and brutal, and they lingered upon every grotesque detail. ",2017

History repeats itself and Jigsaw goes back to their old roots being simple, with basic traps and a mind blowing ending. Unfortunately there's one trap I disliked, it involves lasers. It relies on CGI too much, the stakes are high but the practical traps are way more fun and creative. With wires, tricks, chains, a puppet and the classic pig head, this film will leave you a with a smile on your face.",2017

9,"Even though people rarely admit it, the 'Saw' series has been one of the highest quality horror series ever made. 'Jigsaw' is the eighth entry in the series and there is still yet to be a bad film made amongst them. Some are undoubtedly better than others, but I defy you to point me out one that is inherently bad. I also defy you to show me another horror series (even any type of series at all is rare) that has maintained quality across that many films. That's why I was so happy that 'Jigsaw' was a brilliant movie, because if they had come back seven years later only to put forward a bad film for the sake of making money it would have ruined everything. Luckily that was not the case though.",2017

When the movie was half way through I did not understand most parts, but later I found out how the plot worked and stuff. The plot twist at the end is cool (not the best) and I did not see it coming. I was kind of disappointed though when I went home. Once in bed I started puzzling all pieces together end I found out the plot was actually pretty good! I liked the movie and it was fun to watch. It is not the best Saw movie, but A lot better than Saw 7 (Saw the final chapter). If you are a big Saw fan just like me, go watch it! You will probably like it :D",2017

9,If you love horror/thriller type of movies you must have seen at least one of Saw movies. It's been 7 years since the last Saw movie and with this one Jigsaw makes a great comeback. Like all Saw movies this one is also tied with the other ones and also gives you a new perspective about the previous ones. The plot looks simple at first. Looking like a classic John Kramer game where he wants justice and trying to teach a lesson to his chosen players. But as the movie continues it gets more complicated and it keeps you on the edge of your seat which is great. And as we get to climax part of the movie the legendary Saw music starts playing and all of the things that you are confused about is explained and you're just left with an open mouth. Because the plot twist is really good and a clever one. So i think this is a really must see!!,2017
3,"The ""Jigsaw"" franchise had a reasonable beginning in 2004 and along the years, the downfall was easily predicable with terrible, incredible and worse and worse screenplays. In 2010, the franchise reached its bottom with the awful ""Saw 3D"". The franchise was resting in peace, but seven years later, the directors Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig decide to revive the infamous franchise with the writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg. The result is a shameful bad movie with the most absurd and incredibly twists and overrated in IMDb. My vote is three.",2018

4,"After not really caring for the last pirates of the Caribbean film I didn't have high expectations for this movie but I went and saw it and I was right to have these low expectations. The premise of the film sees the return of captain jack sparrow as he leads an expedition for the Trident of Poseidon while on the run from an old enemy. Johnny depp has become known for the role of jack sparrow and I think when in that character he usually delivers his best, that was until this film. He has some of the charisma and jack nuances in his performances that makes him entertaining, but this character is a shell of his former self. This is the least funny he has ever been, the least charming he has been and I ended up feeling like he phoned in this performance quite a bit. The supporting cast is pretty large but I will go over the main ones, Salazar played by Javier bardem is the main villain in this film and I thought he was a pretty decent villain. He is a little hard to understand at times but, he is pretty menacing in this film and I liked his back story that makes him also a little sympathetic but then he is menacing and it adds to his performance. Geoffrey rush is back as hector barbosa in this film and like always he is great, I wasn't the biggest fan of some of the things done with his character but rush always gives a fun charismatic performance that does make me smile. However, we get to the new characters played by Brendon thwaites and kaya scodelario who are both completely wooden and lacking. I didn't buy there chemistry at all and I didn't like the involvement of lore to try to make Them interesting because they really weren't. The story is very jumbled and a bit all over the place, similar to stranger tides there is just too many people going after this artifact that you don't even remember them all. The Salazar plot and trident plot feels like two different movies and the meshing just really didn't work. The script has a couple of laughs in it I can't deny that I laughed enough for passable. However, there was a lot of misses in this script with this possibly being the least funny of the films and definitely the film with the least drama and heart in it. The style of this film has some of the pirates action scenes that are very enjoyable especially towards the beginning of the film. But as the film progresses the action felt a bit hollow as I didn't really care about any of the characters. Overall this is the weakest pirates film in my opinion and unless you are a big fan of this franchise like me it isn't really worth a watch.",2017
2,"I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to not be entertaining. At least the previous films had great swashbuckling fun and wit. They told bizarre stories that had strange characters, all of which had something to offer to the film. The adventures were full of surprises, making them worth at least checking out, and Jack Sparrow was a character that was actually worth waiting for. This film had no personality. No heart. No passion. It was nothing more than a ""bottom of the barrel"" film with cheap sex jokes and physical gags, most of which were served by Jack Sparrow. He was drained of the spirit that he had in the previous films, and wasn't even worth the time he was on screen. Nobody cared, nobody tried, and the full theater was nearly emptied halfway through the film. What once was a film series known for their cinematic experiences, is now nothing more than a dried up corpse, a result of Disney's relentless need to milk their products to death.",2017
1,"(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can't think of any besides Keira Knightley's acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it's a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer's freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore's music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court. ",2017
8,"Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.",2017

5,"The fifth installment of the Pirates-series is by all means a step up from the fourth. In all film-series, when a sequel is released it's mandatory to compare it to the best one - which in this case arguably everyone agrees is the first one. That may be unfair, but it's the reality. Now.",2017
8,"I was going to give a 10 simply due to opening scene but then movie started to slow a little bit.Also, unnecessarily, the stone lady on the head of the ship started to jump ship to ship and try to hunt Jack with a giant stone spear,in a sudden.Nonetheless, I will surely watch this movie again. Seeing Jack moving around is always worth watching the whole movie.So it is a smiling 8.",2017
9,"Expectations is everything with these movies. While the previous Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) movie feels more like a spin-off than a direct sequel to the original trilogy, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge"" continues the lore of the first 3 movies. While continuity errors are somewhat blatant, you can't say this movie is the worst of the 5 PotC movies. The actions are more grounded than the previous movies, and they managed to salvage themselves after the less-than-mediocre ""On Stranger Tides"". The humor's there, and just enough. The amount of screen time of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley probably means that there'll be more of these movies in the future. There's also a familiar feels to the first movie in this one. Perhaps this familiarity is what makes critics hate it. But seriously, if you despised ""On Stranger Tides"", this one you'll probably like. I'd say this is the best PotC movie since the first one back in early 2000's.",2017
1,Sometimes I wonder how bad can the Hollywood script writers be? Looks like the people who wrote the script for this movie were imbeciles. Its one thing to write a bad script and its totally another to write something which is this nonsensical.,2017
10,"I am a huge fan of Pirates of Caribbean franchise. I was desperately waiting for this 5th installment (Salazar revenge/Dead men tell no tails). I watched it in IMAX 3D. The movie is full of actions, adventures and there are a lot of surprises and you will not keep your eyes away even for a min. This franchise has some of the perfect special effect and CGI. Every character in the movie is referenced well and Jack is always ruling the sea. You are aware of the origin of Henry in the movie from the trailer that he is will turner son but you are not aware of the relation between carina and captain barbossa. That was just amazing and emotional as well. While watching I was like OMG what is going to happen next many times. It was very fun to watch. So far the best movie for year 2017. And I don't agree with the critics and a low rating on rotten tomatos. If you enjoyed and remember the movie as a memory then it is worth watching. 10/10 for story, effects, actions and comedy. Now waiting for its 6th installment.",2017

7,"After watching with very low expectations to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it is hard to understand the legion of haters that write in IMDb. The film is not a masterpiece but is funny, entertaining, with great cast, special effects, screenplay and story. Johnny Depp performs the wolf, drunken and smart Captain Jack Sparrow in the usual funny way. Cinema lovers of fantasy-adventure genre must ignore the bad reviews and question what this kind of people that writes that the movie is not good like to see or if they have difficulties to understand a story with many characters. My vote is seven.",2017
2,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed! I know the first 3 by heart, but there was ALMOST none of Captain Jack's wit, or his funny escapades, NO background given for Will's son or the pretty witch/scientist lady, several barely-begun stories...and Sparrow wasn't even hot in this one! This is one of those movies I wish I could get a refund for!",2017
2,"If you are looking for witty dialog and chemistry between characters, this is not the movie for you. The magic is all gone. It's a lifeless sequence of stunning visuals and action sequences. Every actor/actress seems to play like a ghost of former self. The script is truly bad.. no focus, just a collection of random things happening.",2017
1,"Please for the love of god stop now. How is it possible for these to continue to get worse, and even more pertinently, why do I continue to see them. For the first time in a very long while I considered walking out of a film, and that was after about 15 minutes. I was bored stupid. They try to continually up the action set pieces in this franchise but just manage to make them more stupid, bombastic and confusing with muddied visuals, terrible pacing and stupidity from the characters. And some director really needs to get hold of Johnny Depp and get him to actually act and not merely caricature his original creation of the first pirates just upping the ticks and foibles. And as for the acting of the rest of the cast, Jesus. Even good actors seem to feel the need to Depp it up in this series, and the two new leads were so wooden they didn't need ships to cross the seas. Add to all that a god awful script full of pathetic dialogue and character motivation with a pee poor story arc and this turd may finally sink the franchise. Here's hoping.",2017
2,"I was really expecting another good story in the series, but this failed to deliver. The movie was very tedious to watch, and a number of times, I almost walked out, but kept thinking it had to get better. It did not. Jack, was a weaker, and not as focused on his stunts, but being drunk and unable to function in any manor. The story line was weak, and not very interesting, although it could have been better done. Most of the actors, seemed to be there more for the paycheck, than to give another good performance. In all, I could not find anything that made the movie worth the money I spent. Did not even get one laugh out of it.",2017
4,"Of course Pirates is a great concept, with exact the right music. But in this version 'Salazar's revenge' there is a lack of content, despite a lot of very nice special effects. (I liked the safe-deposit-part very much!) It is a pity, because there are such a great stories in Caribbean history. The Amsterdam archives have enough to discover and uncover. Of course, the makers have their own excuse 'dead men tell no tales'. So how could we blame them?",2017

3,"Pirates of the Caribbean, when it came out in the early 2000s, was one of the most original and unique movies to be released in recent memory. It was a great mix of comedy, adventure and action that could appeal to the whole family. Depp's boozy Captain Jack Sparrow was part ruthless pirate and part sly wink. You never knew which one you would get. The first one got it all right: a great story, a ton of adventure and a lot of fun. However, the series has dropped in quality a bit more with each subsequent release, to the point that now I find the whole thing boring, trite and overdone. Depp's Sparrow continues his act, but now it's more canned and predictable. The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. It deals with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swain's son and that he wants to join an evil pirate group and yada yada. Some explosions, sword fights, Sparrow drunk walking and some boats on the water. Ho hum. The good news was at two hours, this was one of the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome.",2017
3,"First off, it was awesome this movie brought back so many characters from the previous movies but the problem is these characters did not really add anything to the film. Mullroy and Murtogg were great to see again but were not the same funny two people like before. Secondly, it was good to hear a lot of the music reused but sadly I would rather just hear the music instead of watch what was happening. I dunno why people say Javier Bardem did such an excellent job in this film he barely said anything and when he did it was hard to understand him. I didn't care if he lived or died and his ship was super lame. He was not even a freaking' pirate!!!! Ugh, such a lame villain!!",2017
1,"Going to see this film was part of a birthday gift. (I want a birthday do-over.) When one of my nephews heard we were all going to see it he gracefully sidestepped the invitation saying he had trig homework to do. HE is the family movie buff, so that was a major red flag. ",2017
2,"The movie really disappointed me. The story is not well elaborated and sometimes confusing.I had a feeling that i was watching cartoon.Although they have changed the directors, pirate franchise continues to fall in quality.With no doubt this is the worst pirate film of them all. This movie gives us the most stupid and clumsiest pirates ever.The only good thing about the movie are the special effects.",2017
8,"Dear readers, Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that I have been watching since my high school. Now I am already in the working life, but the spirit of that movie series is still on my heart, so that yesterday I watched it. Since last year, I know that there will be a continuity of that movie, but I never knew that the movie is about Revenge, well yes, finally about Revenge. Before I am telling to you my review, it is important to remember that each movie of Pirates of Caribbean movie, includes an unique plot within it, for example the last adventure is about Family, and then the others are about Love, Friendship, Father-Son relation, and Captain-Crew honesty. In this latest movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is about Revenge, but do not hesitate to watch it, because the plot is designed not to show up about the Revenge itself, but there are legend, myth, Science, Witch, fantasy, history of Bank, ethical Law of pirates, and of course ridiculous adventure are around the plot, from the beginning to the end. I can guarantee you that you will be laughing of many funny actions or languages, and sometimes you do not care about the end, what you really care is that the safety of the soul of this movie: That is Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, Johny Depp is still the soul of the movie. He is leading all characters and he is the one who is making this adventure happens. Besides of its perfect, this movie has some illogical scenes and some missing plots, so that for those who are not really fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies, will not really understand who is the real enemy and what pirates stake of life in that kind of level to protect Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, there must be a betrayal, but this movie never betray you to give a lot of have fun!!",2017

1,"Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie. Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie was only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles. However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings. Don't waste your time and money with this movie.",2017
3,OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***,2017
1,"I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was......... BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not great and accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting - I think I caught ""Blue Steel"" face a few times. Gal is gorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they not have found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was more Wonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about being beautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explain snow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn't like looking drop dead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just another Hollywood ""preach it"" to the public movie only this time the super hero is thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, and condescending.",2017
1,"I don't get it. I must be completely out of touch with what is popular for today's movie going public, and am scratching my head how this terrible movie receives such good reviews. This was the first movie I've been to at the cinema that I wanted to leave. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. I decided to stay to see if things would turn around. Big mistake. ",2017
5,"So I decided to go and see the movie because 8.1 is such a good rate in IMDb. And seriously, what could be better than a hot girl with superpowers killing Nazis. However when I was seeing it I felt that it just was another superhero's movie with nothing to offer more than the same poor structure of the majority of bad superhero's movies: a half naive hero finding her path to kill an evil character that is the responsible of all the bad stuff happening in the world. In the mean time, the hero decides to believe in clichés like ""find love"" and ""everything is about what you believe"" and while she win the knowledge of those clichés, by very poor reasoning by the way, she increases her power to kill the evil character. So it was an extremely predictable movie that we all have seen 80 times but with a hot girl in it. Besides, the rules of the game were never clear, for example: at the end of the movie she decides to forgive the life of a German person because it was the right thing to do and she was so just and good, but during all the movie she was killing people, so one never understands where were the line between the good and the bad, the only thing that helps you to understand the line between the good and the evil was that in one side you had giggling English men and in the other side you had enraged Nazis. And on top of that, the characterization of Ares during the movie is just painful, they put it like a demon that believes that humanity is substantially bad and that they should kill each other for that, but Ares is the god of war and it also means understanding honor, courage and the beauty of the fight, which is very far from the Nazi's horrors. If Ares didn't exist, the Wonder Woman couldn't exist either because she is a character built on the vigor of war. I give it a few stars because the build up of the beginning was actually cool and kind of funny.",2017
1,"Saw Wonder Woman yesterday... quite frankly it's actually really bad. Story line all over shop, character development, all over the shop, main Charakter Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 16 year old imbecile, she's a goddess for crying out loud, the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up and all over the shop. The way she kills Ares in the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was from the get go and a full 2hrs earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. I'm not even getting into the feminism part of it. ",2017
2,"So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. ",2017
1,seriously!? this movie deserves nothing more than 5 out of 10 stars. Terrible film. Acting was horrible. Story made little to no sense at all. Action was mediocre at best.. people need to realize that being politically correct doesn't require you to give this film a good rating. ,2017
5,"I disagree with the hype. Spoilers WARNING...The script was pedestrian; the pace was scattered (too fast in the beginning, and too slow when putting the team together); the logic was heavily flawed (one night on a small sailboat in the middle of the ocean with no indication of where they were and you're in London the next morning? One person/Diana single- handedly suppresses a whole front line of gunfire with her shield and wrist-cuffs? A German sniper repeatedly missing multiple non-moving and completely exposed targets? Steve's team of mostly non-soldiers barging through a German camp without much resistance? A spy able to just blow up a whole camp by himself in broad daylight on the fly without being discrete?); wasted/under-explored story lines (Dr. Poison under-explored; Steve's friend, who's supposedly a deadly sniper, unable to shoot, huh?); the motivations/rationale for some of the characters' decisions were a stretch, if not unconvincing (Wonder Woman's mom initially not permitting WW to be trained in combat, especially when we found later in the movie that WW is the God Killer? Steve insisting on going after the German general while armistice was being negotiated? Team just decides to continue fighting without further pay after initially clamoring for money while nothing happens in the process that shows they're moved by something other than money?); unexplained parts that the audience is simply expected to accept (power of the wrist cuffs was never explained; Dr. Poison loses her notebook, but all of a sudden, just conveniently finds a scrap of paper that turned on the light bulb for her; Steve's conversation with Dr. Poison at the gala about seeing her experiment didn't make much sense at all). There are more other issues with this film, but there are more than enough listed above already. All in all, I saw way too many flaws in this film to agree with any of the hype.",2017

I had hope with a twist at the end that it would get better, but once again, it just fell flat.",2017
1,"The movie is filled with cgi effects that are all around bad. Physics seems to just disappear and shots look awkward. Characters gets introduced, characters that give no further development to the story and are portrayed as stereotypes (drunk Irishman, the Indian, etc.).

This movie's script is terrible, especially the ending, which makes absolutely no sense (I will explain in the spoilers portion below.) It also doesn't really do anything to develop the characters. When they do take a minute to say something about someone or add a little character into themselves, POOF! They're gone, not likely to return. I can't really blame the actors and actresses here for anything because they try to work with what they got. Unfortunately, the script does nothing to help them along.

I get the challenge to producers and artists to fill hundreds of channels, 24/7, I really do. I've learned to seriously adjust my expectations.

Also, I do not feel the main character was manipulative but charmingly ""in your face"". I love that she stood up for herself. I am a west coaster to my toes and have no preconceived opinions of the ""jewish princess"" culture but I found it to be entertaining and different from anything else on TV.

It's a little bit ""shticky"" but not too much that it gets in the way.(Frankly I love all the shtick anyway) Midge is a 50's woman who faces the same issues women do today- finding her voice as she is forced into believing she has something valuable to offer the world. PLEASE PLEASE give us the full show! We can't wait to see Midge's budding talent develop and watch as she grows in her independence.",2017
10,"I loved everything about this pilot - except the fact that it ended after only 51 minutes. Rachel Brosnahan is a revelation -- fierce, funny, and extremely likable. The venue (NYC) and period (late 1950s) add a star in my book, and the focus on the then-embryonic standup comedy art form all conspire to make this an absolutely outstanding program. Rachel's parents are a hoot as well. This somewhat-edgy effort needs to be expanded to an entire season ASAP! Get on Amazon Prime and vote early and often!",2017
4,"Okay, I keep reading these raves, and wondering what all the fuss is about. As a longtime New Yorker, and born long enough ago to get all the references, I keep waiting for this to be anything but a standard shtick comedy cliché. Cool 50s clothes (and endless misplaced music, that just keeps going back and forth from 50s to 60s) are not enough to surmount a lack of reality (and if you're going to bring Lenny Bruce into this morass, you do need some reality).

The writing and cast are excellent and I hope this gets picked up as a series because this is the first Amazon Pilot that I have seen that grabbed me from the beginning and entertained me throughout. I was not expecting much from this when I began watching since I had not heard anything about it prior to viewing. Was I surprised! Nice to see Tony Shaloub again and although I did not recognize any other names or faces among the cast, everyone did a fine job. The writing was tight with no wasted moments (no filling). A nice touch was adding Lenny and Honey Bruce in the story as well as showcasing The Gaslight.

8,"This sitcom has definite potential. I wasn't sure at the start, though I'm a sucker for vintage pieces, and I haven't seen many period comedies earlier than the seventies (which always make me shudder, hitting too close to my childhood home!). It slowed me up even more with some of the college backstory, as I went to Bryn Mawr, and albeit in a different era, the girls in this little clip were unlike any I met there. However, once the writer got into her groove with the main plot: girl's husband wants to be a comic, but she's ten times as funny as he is, it left me wanting to binge the next few episodes to find out where it goes. Hurry up and produce them! Anassa Kata, Midge Maisel!",2017

Too much time spent with secondary characters in unfunny set pieces like the one at the exercise class. That scene was so lame it made me grimace. And that isn't the only cringe-worthy part of it. The parents of the two principal characters are cliche-ridden caricatures that are so over the top they could only be funny to someone who is not woke enough to be offended. I tend to think the writers of the show took the path of least resistance. Instead of nuanced characters with something clever or meaningful to say, they're all loud-mouthed boors without any discernible motivation for their actions.",2017
3,"First let me say that I am NOT easily offended, but my goodness.....! These writers not only hit every Jewish cliche they could find, they really had the actors lean into the turn.

I would rather watch a show based on her character than the shlock I see now.",2017

10,"I love this series so much I have marked where the main character, Mrs. Miriam 'Midge' Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) gives her poignant perspectives on being a Jewish ""June Cleaver"" housewife/mother of 2 turned divorce in 1950's New York. The unbelievably talented cast that supplies 'Midge' with the witticism's of her life is also top notch. Jewish parent's Abe/'Poppa' Weissman (Tony Shalhoub) and Rose/'Momma' Weisman (Marin Hinkle) provide good filler material, but it's husband Joel Maisel (Michael Zegen) whose portrayal of a typical(?) ""good Jewish boy"" who just can't get his act together that fuels the fire. Somehow he's unhappy in a life where he's been given everything; a VP in the family business, a home where his wife provides everything a man could want; even his mistress Penny Pann (Holly Curran) dotes on him like a Yiksha puppy. Yet it's his hopeless dream of being a stand-up comedian whose crash and burn fuels 'Midges' fire. It unifies those moments of comedic banter either in a dingy off beat nightclub, at dinner parties or even a downtown protest that make this series shine; BUT the Season(1)ender is pure comedic heaven! Most of all, ""Mrs. Maisel"" reminds me of the late great Joan Rivers career; also a former Jewish housewife/divorce in the '50s who's unique perspective on family, friends, life and everything thought to be salacious and off limits wasn't once she gave it the ""Can We Talk?"" spotlight. This all makes me wonder what Season(2) will bring; will ""Mrs. Maisel"" continue to shadow the famous comedienne River's career or will it find a different avenue to lighten the hearts of those who faithfully follow this FANTASTIC Amazon Original Series?",2017
10,"Amazon gets it right! A well-written, pithy, punchy, dramatic comedy that is as wonderful to watch as it is to hear. Rachel Brosnahan was darkly complex in House of Cards, but here she shows her comedic chops to the nth degree as a housewife and mother whose husband (a failed wannabe stand-up comic) decides to abruptly abandon her for his secretary. Miriam accidentally becomes a stand-up sensation when she vents her frustration with all of this from the same stage where her husband bombed. She's comfortable in the spotlight, indifferent to the audience laughing at her situation, but that's the charm. She hates her situation, and she has a way to complain in a way in which she is not judged for speaking her truth. Although, the police have issues with her language. ",2017

You will laugh a whole lot more at a standard sitcom comedy, that the ""critics"" and the ""snobs"" are going to trash on. Hell, I laughed more watching North By Northwest, and they don't label it nowhere a comedy.",2018
10,So I kept seeing this show pop up on my amazon video and I am so glad I decided to watch it. I cannot wait to see more. After seeing the first episode I ranted about it to friends and then realized it is from the same amazing person who brought us Gilmore Girls (all time favorite show) then I fell in love. It's so funny and original and keeps you wanting more. The relationships are played out so well and it all seems natural. Love this show. #JewishGirlsAreFunny #IKnowCuzIAm,2017
10,"I've found this show completely randomly by watching some YouTube trailers. The idea of a show about woman-comedian interested me and I've decoded to give it a go. And I sure wasn't disappointed. On contrary, I am now hooked and can't wait for the rest of the season. The show is very well written, filled with quirky lines and great atmosphere. The fact that its set in the 50's could go in a bad direction but it actually makes the story more unique and situations funnier. Separate praise for the design of clothes, apartments and presentation of New York in the 50's. And, of course, I just have to give credit for such an amazing lead character - a funny, smart, gorgeous woman that acts way ahead of her time. Finally an interesting and very well presented female character!",2017
10,"Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? ",2017
10,"Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.",2017
10,You should definitely watch if you are a true fan of Spider-Man and Marvel. Tom Holland revived Peter Parker as a new. Michael Keaton's portrayal as Vulture was very good.There is no doubt that Tobey Maguire was a better actor. But if we give Holland more time than I hope that he will nail it with his performance. :),2017
1,"I have seen all the Spiderman movies up to date, and let me tell you, this one was the worst of them all. Disney's marvel send us straight back to those bad cringeworthy kids 90's TV shows. That was full of cheese and unfunny forced jokes with a very thin story line. The only positive thing about the new Spiderman movie is Michael Keaton and Tom Holland. they do a good job in this mess of a movie. But that save the movie when over 60 years of what made Spiderman, the Spiderman, gets tossed out. Everything can be summed up in one word: incompetence. If you are a fan of Spiderman do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.",2017
5,"Spoilers and review coming from a Spider-Man fan. I want to say if I knew nothing about Spider-Man, this movie was good. But sadly I loved him and grew up with spidey. The movie was a typical marvel movie and funny at parts. But the rest, they hurt my inner child ruining spidey. ",2017
10,"Oh Spider-Man, we meet again. It's been a long time since we saw tantalizing Tobey Maguire in the suit. Spidey was in need of a comeback- oh wait, I forgot that already happened...Andrew Garfield this one is for you! ",2017
1,"Did the Homecoming writers actually think that pushing together the 2 split halves of the ferry boat would stop the boat from sinking? And why did Iron Man just fly away after pushing the 2 split halves of the ferry boat together, without even checking if any of the passengers might be injured and need to be air-lifted to a hospital? And why were there cars on the Staten Island Ferry? Don't the writers know that cars haven't been allowed on the Staten Island Ferry after 9/11? And why doesn't Spider-Man have Spider-Sense in MCU? When Peter ditched Liz at the Homecoming dance and leaves the building, he gets ambushed outside by 1 of the bad guys. No way that should happen with Spider-Sense. So he definitely doesn't have Spider-Sense in MCU.",2017
10,"Another try to show us the same angsty story about power and great responsibility? Wrong! Peter stuck in the middle of the teenage drama? Not quite! Spider-man as an Avenger? Well.... let me stop you there. My first impression when the trailer came out was, well I had a lot of doubts. For instance why there is no Uncle Ben, why Peter's best friend knows his best-guarded secret (that has been reviled in the comics only to help Iron Man's team during Civil War). Aunt May who is even less aware of everything? Iron Man in the background? No 'Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-man'? But then I went to see the movie and to say, I was pleasantly surprised. We got the whole need look at Peter Parker's life. First of all, we've never got to see Peter so young, though Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire tried. He looks young and he is young. His life isn't exactly defined by his uncle's death. Sure it is implied but at the same time, it doesn't imply that this is why Peter became Spiderman. What we also got to see is Peter who learns how to be a hero. This kid really got one of the most solid moral core among the heroes. And now we can see how he learns how to do his job. It's no longer than 5 minutes of speeded process of embracing the powers, where in one moment he breaks the tap, can't control his 'sticky' powers and performs superhuman reflex and the next scene he has his suit made and his powers under control. No. And that's why it's good. It's funny, comical even, but true. Peter is true, he eats larb, builds lego Deathstar, studies for Spanish quiz, and saves the day. The other thing that surprised me was how well Tom and his real friend Jacob played the dynamic duo of Peter and his 'guy in the chair' Ned. It gives us a bit of fresh view, innocent even when it all is a game, an awesome adventure. And it also gives us A LOT of good humour. Then next we've got Aunt May, who is building a new life with Peter, starting over. She also has some kind of different innocence than we've seen before. She supports Peter and is just a bit more than an episodical character needed for the plot. Another character that has been rebooted is Flash Thompson, Peter's bully. Of course, he still is a bully, but the writers decided to expose the other side of him. For me, it gives a glimpse at the future where after all Peter and Flash became friends and Spider-man's ex- bully becomes a hero, Venom. Additionally, we had a chance to witness Happy's great return, yay!? And finally RJ, we are here. He did good, what did you expect. But he didn't steal the show, oh no. it was A Spider-man movie from the very end. Another pro of the movie is that there is no romance-centric plot. It's not always about getting a girl people! Moving on, that scene! You know which one! You didn't see that coming? Because I didn't. Simple yet great plot twist. But enough about the plot. Then again, the marvellous Marvel logo that constantly gets better and SPIDER-MAN THEME! That's right! The music was good, even though I was hoping to get another catch and a great soundtrack like we had in GoTG and GoTG vol2. Another thing that got me surprised was the camera. We've been served with a whole lot of scenes from new, and different angles. We got lots of different perspectives. General, big, from point of view and the best of all Peter's vlog from Germany. Last but not least brilliance of the credits. It really makes you want to sit there and wait for the credits to end, not like we wouldn't do this anyway. ;) I heard someone saying that they were disappointed with Peter. He was making a fool of himself. He was constantly saying: ""I'm sorry but I gotta go"" and couldn't get the job done right from the take one. But isn't it just how his life goes? because from what I know it is. Peter is one of the most relatable and at the same time tragic (ok, maybe not that tragic) comic characters. Because of he always, always does what is right. No matter what. he sacrifices his personal life, his love his happiness to make the world a better place. This is the reboot. This is the beginning. This is young Peter learning to be a hero. Him learning about power and responsibility. Learning to stay closer to the ground. And even though teenage Peter being pulled into high schools drama does sound cliché it paradoxically isn't. It's good. It's funny and it's just simply Peter Parker's life.",2017
10,Watch Spiderman Homecoming You Review,2017
1,"With good CGI and an interesting take on The Vulture, but extremely cringy jokes forced in seemingly every line of dialogue, bad acting by everyone except Keaton and Holland, and the inexplicable reason to have Iron Man & his tech dominate a film that isn't even his (and make Spider-Man seem weak/dependent). SM: Homecoming is disappointing. 4/10",2017
10,"This Movie is fantastic Tom Holland is an amazing Peter Parker and Spider-Man!Maguire was a great Peter and Garfield was a great Spidey but Holland nails both of them.It is a great movie with many jokes and twists.Near the end of the movie Peter asks Liz to Homecoming and she says yes.When Peter arrives at Liz's house Adrian Toomes(The Vulture) answers the door and says he's Liz's dad.Peter then leaves Liz at Homecoming to stop him from stealing Tony Stark's plane that is moving all his stuff to the new Avengers Facility Upstate.Peter stops the Vulture and the Vulture is arrested. Peter then learns Liz is moving to Oregon because her father doesn't want them there during the trial.Michelle is elected the new Leader of the Decathlon team is tells them her friends call her MJ making us believe she will be a Mary Jane like character.Tony Stark then offers Peter a spot in the Avengers and a new suit that looks like the Iron Spider suit.Peter declines the offer and continues being a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.Tony gives Peter back the suit he made for him and he puts it on and takes off the mask not knowing Aunt May is right behind him in the Apartment she then shouts ""WHAT THE F..."" with the rest of the curse being cut off by the end credits.There are two after credit scenes one with The Vulture in prison and he runs into a man who will become the Scorpion and Vulture denies knowing Peter's identity even though he knows it.The final after credit scene has another Captain America PSA about patience and being disappointed for waiting so long so so little. So all in all fantastic movie best marvel movie and Spider-Man movie by a long shot.",2017
10,"You will enjoy every single minute of this movie, Tom Holland is definitely the best peter Parker and Spider-Man we have ever seen. Marvel studios really did deliver with this one great action, humor, comedy, and much more. The villain in this movie who is the vulture is probably the best marvel movie villain ever, Michael Keaton gives his best portrayal of the role. This is not a iron man movie this is a straight Spider-Man movie that tells us his life before and after civil war and it all sums up very good.",2017
9,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a much needed Spider-Man reboot after the mess that the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" series were. This movie is actually a tie with Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" for the best movie based on the character and Tom Holland, after this movie and his debut in last year's ""Civil War"" is easily the best on-screen Spidey.",2017
10,"I'm a huge fan of SpiderMan. I was grown up with this hero's movies, animated television, etc. I'm the one who always likes Peter's invention. I think many of you might think like me about his suit. It seemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn't helping Peter with his tech support but if you watch this movie and open your mind. you'll understand what he wants to prove himself like as Tony said ""If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it."" So In my opinion it's this version that finally puts a truly portrayal of #PeterParker. Tom did great job. I love it.",2017
10,"Honestly, when the movie was announced I really did think that this would've ruined the classic Spiderman franchise, seems that I was wrong. This is an absolutely 'amazing' movie, best Spiderman movie yet! Although actors have changed, this time the Avengers recognise this young man as a hero and they also add a story to it, the classic Spiderman trying to stop the train with the tensile strength of his webs was recreated in the movie and many of the original features were retained. There is also a very funny sense of humour (personally) and I honestly found it hilarious. They could not choose anyone better than Ned as Spidey's best friend and I would rate this movie an excellent 9.6 out of 10!",2017
10,"There was nothing wrong or bad about this movie. It was witty, comical and funny, and had many twists and turns along the way as well. I have been a big fan of Spider- Man for years and it was honestly better than the Spider-Man movies starring Tobey Maguire and much better than the Amazing Spider-Man movies starring Andrew Garfield. It stuck to its comical roots; Spider-man is just a young kid trying to prove himself. The Amazing Spider-man series focused too much on the action and tried to make the movie look cooler in 3-D and did not focus on the story-line too much. Homecoming had a perfect blend of action, drama, and story-line and that is what makes this movie great. ",2017
9,"I felt like this spider man movie was over the top. The high school setting made it feel like a true spider man movie where a kid wants to be a hero. The moment we all know is when peter parker runs into the alleyway and and rips his shirt off showing his spidey symbol. I think Tom Holland did a fantastic job at acting in this film. But the only dull part is, it didn't have as much action packed moments as I expected, being a long time Michael Bay fan, I've gotten used to the explosions and action packed scene. But very well done movie!",2017
10,"Several months after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Peter Parker, with the help of his mentor Tony Stark, tries to balance his life as an ordinary high school student in Queens, New York City while fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-Man as a new threat, the Vulture, emerges. Spider-Man: Homecoming is what a 2nd reboot should look and feel like and personally as much as i liked those 'Amazing Spider-Man' Movies i would definitely pick this one over those 2 films. Tom Holland's portrayal is a little bit more closer to the comics from tone, to humor to everything plus every time he goes to School and he does things like talking to Ned about building the Lego Death Star or about Spider-Man and basically nerd stuff or school stuff you as a viewer you can relate to this kid and i found myself relate to Peter Parker he is a nerd, he is awkward and makes other people around him either mad or just makes them laugh. Now the important stuff about Homecoming is if the villain is actually you know? good? Well i'll tell you this The Vulture is not just a great villain but the best one so far just those 5 first minutes of the film make total sense of why this guy chose the crime life and why it's important for him to succeed his mission plus Michael Keaton once again he knocked it out of the park he was an amazing Batman, an amazing Birdman and now an amazing Vulture i mean the guy delivers a great performance in everything that he does plus he is the only actually scary looking villain of the Entire MCU, Shocker is also in the film but he doesn't get to do much i guess we will see more of him in the Near Future so just relax it's still way early to judge him, Flash Thompson was also quite good and Tony Revolori really surprised me a lot cause i was very much against that casting at first but i was very blown away by the guy i mean it's a different Spider-Man so we need a different Flash too right? Another actor that surprised me as well was Marisa Tomei as Aunt May and sure she is very young to play the part but do you honestly really care at this point? You just want to see every single character get justice and you do get that. Jacob Batalon and Zendaya also surprised me a lot and they were both super funny especially Jacob some of his lines are super funny. Laura Harrier who plays Liz also portrays the character in a different way and personally i did liked her a lot as Peter's Girlfriend. Iron Man and Happy also make a return and their just as good as they where back in 2008 when we first met them because let's face it there's no way that RDJ can disappoint as Iron Man and then we have our breaking star Tom Holland a.k.a Peter Parker/Spider-Man this kid was just terrific and full of so much freaking energy and he does portray Spidey in a great way it's also way more modern and different than the previous 2 versions and that doesn't mean it's a bad thing he delivers the humor, the action and the drama in a great way and that has to do with the excellent team behind this MCU Film. In the end i was very much blown away by Spider-Man: Homecoming it was everything i wanted it to be and even more plus there's some great twists and turns along the way that i think die hard fans of the Franchise will love. Many critics did say that this is the 'Best Spider-Man Yet' and although i do agree in some parts i still think that Maguire's and Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy was a bit better than this film but for a 2nd reboot and a Marvel film this is definitely on my Top 3 easily and i really can't wait for Spider-Man 2. ",2017
10,I have to say this is one of the best marvel ever made Tom Holland has got to be the best spider-man ever to act in the role the others were just the beginning of what Tom Holland can do to make the marvel cinematic universe a better world with super hero's. He could be the next best thin in marvel.,2017
1,"This is what I was afraid of when Disney took over marvel,it should have been called Spider-Man,high school musical ,I know it,s comic-book movie ,but we came a long way to show that comics are not just for kids ,but this sets us back ,none of the characters are like they are in the comics ,Peter was a nerdy school kid but not like this ,flash was a big school bully ,but this flash is a wimp ,my grandmother could take him ,and aunt May is a hottie in this movie ,not the old caring aunt of the comics ,why ,why ,hope this is not a trend ,the suits sucks too.i know they are trying to hit a new up to date audience ,but really.good graphics and action but lame characters and story .guess I,m just getting old .",2017
10,This movie was totally off the hook. The storyline was amazing. It was completely hilarious and full of action at the same time. The graphics and choreography were both awesome. I enjoyed every moment of it. Love the new Spider-man suit. Robert Downey Jr/Iron Man was spectacular of course. Love his mentorship towards Spidey. Michael Keaton made a fantastic villain. I would recommend lots of people to view and savour this classical blockbuster masterpiece. This movie deserves 5/5 stars. Kudos!!!,2017
10,this was the best spider-man movie i have seen in a long time but why is it the best because it is grounded in the why it tells of peter struggles with being spider-man and how he trying to cope with it plus it is not about the iron man at all yes he is key to the plot but it mainly focuses on spidy plus the cast is amazing and make this a much watch summer blockbuster.,2017
10,"I've read a few reviews and I understood a few complaints especially if you were a 90s kid and haven't been keeping up with all the reboots and whatnot of Spiderman. Toby's Spiderman in 2002 was more of ""Spiderman the animated series"" version of the 90s. If you only remember that spider-man this movie could be kind of disappointing. Me on the other hand, I've been keeping up with all my superheroes that interest me, with spider-man being my favorite, I've been watching the Ultimate Spiderman. He crosses over with the avengers a few episodes, even gets invited to join the avengers down like he was in the movie and turned it down. In the cartoon, Shield gives him all of his gadgets and Iron man gives him this Iron man Spider suit. In the movie, Tony stark is responsible for all of his gadgets. The story is a little different but it works for me. I enjoyed watching the spider-man who actually is a kid unlike other spider-man movies. I expected more from this movie but it still was a 10 out of 10. I think that this movie sets up the next spider-man movie and even sets up the avengers movie maybe. The one thing i probably felt was just totally wrong in this movie is the portrayal of flash Thompson. That was very disappointing. Where is the not so smart High school Jock, not this guy that is supposedly one of the fastest in the school (athleticism) but is on a debate team?? GTFOH. only disappointment.",2017
10,This is definitely the best movie about Spider-Man. Marvel and Sony have finally got the character perfect both in and out of the suit. His link in the MCU just makes the movie that much better. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man and Peter Parker and you can't even compare him to the previous 2. This movie is very fun and there are shocking plot twists to look forward to. It's definitely better than the original 2 Sam Raimi movies without a doubt. And be sure to stay to the very very end.,2017
5,"This could have been a human drama of unbearable tension instead it's a movie manufactured with devious intentions. Devious in the real world, in movie making terms is totally accepted to do anything to lure people into the movie theaters. Probably their marketing people thought that a detailed slicing of an ear may do it. It made me so angry. No tension, no passion. The only reason to see the film is Michelle Williams. I didn't realized it was her until well into the movie, in fact until she has a scene with Mark Whalberg. She is real and truthful, when they stay with her everything works. Christopher Plummer plays the old mean billionaire to perfection but I must admit I thought of Kevin Spacey throughout. Everything is shot without real thought behind it. I liked the wind taking over the newspapers but the kidnappers remain a blurry mystery to me, who were they really? They looked like actors to me.",2018
3,"I was familiar with the entire saga and I was eager to see the Ridley Scott dramatization of the events. Now I saw it. A truly depressing movie experience by the director of the original Blade Runner (I'm not going to talk about the 2017 version) All by the numbers with a commercial eye that, I must say, is faltering big time. Did you see Scott's version of Robin Hood with Russell Crowe? No, here Scott attempts the conquering of box office grosses by a close up of J Paul Getty's ear as he's been mutilated. What a shame! Ridley Scott had the extraordinary Michelle Williams to play the mother and she is the one that makes it true even if the script doesn't provide her with well structured scenes and gives her Mark Whalberg to bounce of. He seems the hostage at times, delivering his lines without an ounce of real conviction. Charlie Plummer (oddly enough no relation to Christopher Plummer) is lovely and Christopher Plummer appears as a techno distraction but if they thought we were not going to be replacing Plummer for Spacey in our minds, all the time - aware of the performance as well as the technical wonder - they were wrong. As we left the theater that was the main topic of conversation. Plummer/Spacey. I'm afraid that greed played a part in this operation.",2018
4,"I remember the stories of Paul Getty with pay phones in his house for his guests. He was always a picture boy for the horrors of money. Nobody paid any attention to the horrors not the real ones anyway, just the exterior ones of opulence, meanness and greed. Everything for and because of money, everything. The kidnapping of young J Paul Getty caught the attention of the world then, the plight of his mother is the stuff great drama is made of and here Michelle Williams does wonders with her character. She is totally true, one hundred per cent of the time, but her director doesn't know how to capture it. The film is a rambling, repetitious, undramatic product by Ridley Scott. I didn't detect any real thought behind it. Just craftsmanship and that sometimes is enough, but not this time. I suppose money was also behind this enterprise. Even the stitching of Christopher Plummer in place of Kevin Spacey has a totally commercial connotation. Mark Whalberg? I like him but everyone laughed when he appeared on the screen. So completely out of place, specially when confronted by the powerful authenticity of the wonderful Michelle Williams. All in all a dispiriting affair in more ways than one.",2018
1,"This film commits the worst sin a film can commit: It is dreadfully boring. It feels ultimately pointless and dwindles on mediocrity at all times, making this an even worse Ridley Scott film than Alien: Covenant, as that film was at least hilariously bad at times. This one nearly put me and my buddy to sleep.",2018

The boy's mother (Michelle Williams) is left with only the aid of the Italian police and a former CIA operative who works for Getty (Mark Wahlberg) to help recover her son. ",2017
7,"It's nearly impossible to separate what happened off screen with the final product of All the Money in the World. With that said, Ridley Scott pretty much couldn't have done a better job at making a seamless transition from Kevin Spacey to Christopher Plummer in the role of J. Paul Getty. Inevitably that will be the one thing people always remember about this film, but in the end, the film succeeds elsewhere as a thriller based around the kidnapping of Getty's grandson in Rome in 1973.",2017
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. The grandson of J Paul Getty, the wealthiest man in the world, was kidnapped while in Rome in 1973. That fascinating story holds more than enough drama for an engaging movie, and certainly did not need the notoriety or artistic challenges brought on by the Kevin Spacey scandal. With filming completed and a release date mere weeks away, director Ridley Scott made the decision to erase all evidence of Mr. Spacey's J Paul Getty, and replace him with Oscar winner Christopher Plummer. The ""do-over"" is nearly seamless and it's not a stretch to believe the second version turned out better than the first.",2017
8,"There is a passage from the Bible that says that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into heaven. This movie is a testament to that. The acting is outstanding, you really feel like you are there. The mood of Italy and Europe of the 1970s infuses the film. Terrorism is in the air with the Munich Olympics of 1972, the Red Brigades and Baader-Meinhof gang. The depiction of Getty the oil magnate is shown to us by his various statements and actions. A truly gothic character. The gangster kidnappers are also frightening in their normal everyday lives that accept criminality as if it were like a walk in the park. Hard to believe a time of telephone booths, ringing telephones and sending letters. Ransom demands took time.",2017
1,I don't know about anybody else...but how could you maintain interest in the plot. The real distraction is paying attention to Plummer and knowing that Spacey is muted and superimposed over. ,2017
8,"""All The Money In the World"" (2017 release; 132 min.) is ""inspired by true events"", we are reminded at the beginning. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Rome, 1973"", where we see the 16 yr. old Paul Getty (whose grandfather J. Paul Getty is the richest man in the world's history) is wandering the streets of Rome late one night, only to be abducted. Soon thereafter the abductors demand a ransom of $17 million (about $99 million in today's money). When Paul's mom approaches the elder Getty, he refuses to pay. The voice over by Paul reminds us: ""We look just like you but are nothing like you..."" The movie then gives us the nutshell version of how J Paul Getty made his fortune, taking us to ""Saudi Arabia 1948"" and the ""Toulon, France Shipyard, 1958"". At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
7,"OK, it is a finished cinematic production. Done deal. It delivers. But it is just ok.",2017
3,"Although the fact that this is based on a interesting true events is quite intriguing it was somehow made into a terribly boring movie... In fact, it was the second movie I can remember that I've ever almost walked out of (the first was ""The Witch"")... ""gripping"" and ""edge of your seat"" should be replaced with ""extremely slow moving"" ""absolutely no surprises"" and ""great actors in roles anyone could play"" ..I don't understand all they ""award"" hype when all the actors really did was talk in monotone calmness... I was pretty angry after spending over two hours sitting in a theater for it; although it would have maybe been ok to watch at home when you can pause or do crafts or something while it's on. . .",2018
1,"Not even all the money in the production budget could seamlessly replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer. Director Ridley Scott claimed that it only took 4 days to reshoot all of the scenes, and it looks like it. Regardless of the logistical feat, the reshoots feel oddly disconnected, not the least of which being the early scene in Saudi Arabia where the lighting and framing of Plummer makes it look like he was obviously shot on green screen then superimposed over Spacey. It's hard to push that out of mind once the film gets going because the film never really does get going. There's globe hopping and time jumping happening for the first twenty minutes all to set up the Getty family and their zeitgeist. Scott never lingers long enough on any place or person long enough in the first act to get a strong sense of who or where the characters are aside from, ironically, J. P. Getty played by Plummer - the guy it took the least amount of time to film. Marky Mark just plays himself, but Michelle Williams does her best to give Abigail Harris a sense of Transatlantic panache and motherly desperation. To their credit, they don't have very much to work with. The real star of the movie is Italy, complete with fine art, wry witted prostitutes, pasta, and paparazzi. The best parts of the film reminded me of Fellini's La Strada and La Dolce Vita (mostly for hordes of photographers getting displaced in chaos, but they are only brief peripheral glimmers in the mise en scène of a fruitless story about people we mostly don't care about. One thing that isn't understated is the elder Getty's inhumane love of money, but it's in some strange way justified by the end because his assets were tied up in an art collection that eventually aided his family and various charitable organizations after his death. So the whole ""desperate poor, wanton rich, and the middle class suffer"" theme is hardly unequivocal, and really, what would be the point of telling this story without it?

JP's parents are divorced; his father JPG II is zonked out on pot and other drugs in Morocco, but he has a devoted mother (Michelle Williams). His zillionaire grandfather JPG the First (Christopher Plummer) refuses to pay the $17 million ransom and tells his ex-CIA security chief (Mark Wahlberg) to rescue the boy.",2018
8,"The first thing here, was how great, would it have been to see Kevin Spacey play the embittered old miser, who with his insanely vulgar display of wealth, refuses to pay for his grandson (this talented actor incidentally sharing the same surname as our replacement Plummer) who has been kidnapped by petty terrorists. Well sadly, that remains to not be seen. There are reasons, Plummer, won't bargain, with all the imploring from his grandsons mother (Williams, who's just riveting, and so bloody believable in all her screen time) to grandson Getty back. They are shown earlier on in a section of movie, before we return to the here and now, where that explains some of Plummer's malicious incentive, but when it comes down to it, he's just a selfish, bitter old miser you keep hating throughout. His bodyguard, ex CIA, frogman, what have you (Wahlberg) teams up with Williams, to try to locate and snatch him from his abducters, but of course, we know how things like this follow, where serpentine actions/descisions come into play, resulting in some seriously mid range intense moments. Wahlberg does do us, solid, but there are some moments where he doesn't come off as believable, like a lost sheep, to William's dialogue (spouting words, not acting upon him) while an older Timothy Hutton appears in a score of scenes as one of Plummer's slightly shady, cocky, financial advisers, Plummer, a great actor, doesn't disappoint in the role, doing his normal A1 work, and a Grade A trooper for stepping in at the last minute, due to Spacey's notoriety But it's Williams who walks away, seriously with acting honors. This true story. based on this miserable old millionaire, John Paul Getty, who'd rather pay insanely for a crappy Mona Lisa portrait, then his grandson's freedom, has been wonderfully and vividly brought to the screen, with great detail to story and structure of story, and is a wonderful, fresh way, to start off movie viewing day, 2017. You'll so much hate Plummer, just hoping in his final minutes, he will croak. Like
Williams, it's obvious what the audience will feel like doing, to his own black sculptured head statue.",2018

8,"I hardly go to theatres to see non-blockbuster/Superhero/Horror movies, and the first one I did see was 2016's The Light Between Oceans. That was the first film like that I saw, difference between this and that is one, it's not boring as hell, and two, it's based on a true story; truly proving that real life is scarier than fiction.",2018
8,"I walked into this movie knowing almost nothing about the Getty empire or the particulars of this story. The trailers and the talent involved were the selling points for me so I'm happy to report that even though I went in blind, I didn't have any problems keeping up with the story. The premise is simple in which an oil tycoon's grandson is kidnapped to extort money for a terrorist organization. It's not the premise that makes this worth seeing, its what they do with it and how they build off of it that makes All the Money in the World worthwhile.",2017
1,"The dialogue was painful !!!!! and could have been written by a third-grader. A close friend encouraged me to accompany him to see this and I was greatly disappointed. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director, but the story suffers primarily from the the primitive dialogue and underdeveloped characters. It did ""kill"" some time....",2017
8,"The story of this film is actually is not as true to the facts as some reviewers would have you believe (e.g., Rex Reed). There's a lot of poetic license. For one thing, Getty himself didn't die until three years later, not (seemingly) on the same night that his grandson was released. (That's a Dickensian touch.) For another, the grandson's final suspenseful flight through the town, pursued by killers, seems to have been a total fiction. He showed up at the gas station where his mother and Chase were waiting. But this way we could think about the way the Italian code of silence influences the culture more generally.",2017
5,"I Was disappointed in this one. This movie had the right ingredients great experience. Good actors, a great story...
While you can't say this movie has bad acting, During the movie you really can't bond with these characters because the story doesn't stick on the characters.
For me Ridley real missed a opportunity with this picture.",2018
3,"I quit the movie half way through. Way too over acted, Michelle Williams was especially bad. There was no passion or feeling to this movie. Michelle was trying way to hard to be cool, and ruined the movie. It is very rare that I quit a movie half way through. I have decided to either a) look for a documentary or b) read about the event through an article. This rating is way too high.",2018
9,"There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",2017
8,"""Wind River"" is a gripping murder mystery-thriller written and directed by Taylor Sheridan (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominee for ""Hell or High Water"") starring Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Graham Greene, featuring an unusually strong supporting cast that includes many fine Native American actors. ",2017
10,"The screenwriter who gave us ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" has come back with ""Wind River"" which he also directed and I am now convinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with ""Wind River"" Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.",2017
9,"I saw this few days back on a Blu-ray. As an avid fan of Taylor Sheridan, was looking forward to this without watching the trailer. It is a very beautifully shot, well acted and distressing crime drama. The vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop, it becomes a character in the film.
Wind River is able to showcase Sheridans directing and storytelling strengths.
From the dark border area (Sicario), to the scorching plains of Texas (Hell or ...) and to the frozen mountains in Wyoming in Wind river, the writer/director managed to make the landscape a character in the film. Jeremy Renner potrayed the role of a broken man who is keen on hunting the predators very well n he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The less said about the plot is better because one has to see this film rather than read about its plot.
The film has a very strong social message.
The films conclusion with the message was very horrifying n distressing.",2017
10,"I was lucky enough to see this at the Nantucket Film Festival back in June and I thought it was excellent. And based on the response of the people around me in the packed theater, I wasn't the only one. The applause at the end was loud and long. The movie ended up coming in second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.",2017
8,"When actors decide they want to make the transition to the other side of the camera and direct films, it can be a dicey proposition. It makes me even more nervous when said actor to director decides they don't have the acting out of their system and want to keep acting, but with ""Wind River,"" Taylor Sheridan (best known for ""Sons of Anarchy,"" but also the writer of both ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" with this completing his American Frontier Trilogy) separates himself in order to focus on directing a wonderful based-on-a-true-story tale.",2017
9,"After the southern heat of Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan gives us the cold wintery thriller Wind River.",2017
8,"Crime dramas have always been one of my favorite genres of filmmaking, especially the ones that take themselves seriously and pose interesting questions about life. Wind River takes the genre up in the cold, snowy tundra of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Gritty, brutal, and well-timed action, Wind River builds a simply structured crime film into an important conversation about missing persons with a great storyteller and one great cast.",2017
8,"""Wind River"" (2017 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Wildlife Officer Cory Lambert. As the movie opens, reminding us ""Inspired By Actual Events"", we briefly see a woman running for her life in the snow. We then are introduced to Lambert, who is hunting down wolves. Lambert visits his ex, where he picks up his young son for the day. Lambert then visits the parents of his ex, as their life stock has been attacked, possibly by a lion. In the course of starting his investigation, Lambert finds the frozen body of the woman we saw running for her life. Because it looks like a possible homicide, an FBI agent is called. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
8,"If you've seen any of Taylor Sheridan's previous work, you probably noted that he has a certain style. He tells stories about ways of life in dilapidated regions of the country. He blurs the lines between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" instead framing the status of the selected region as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was case in Sicario and Hell or High Water. ",2017
7,Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success in crafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on an assignment very much alone.,2017
6,"i completely disagree that this movie should be categorized as a thriller or mystery. The story has a predictable outcome that I could see coming from the beginning. The writer did nothing to try and even lead us in a different direction. In the first ten minutes the vicitims family leads us to a boyfriend no ones ever met. Obviously they're going to try and find him, once they do we're hand delivered the entire story. There was no work for the audience to do and zero surprise. I kind of like being lead down a few different paths that can be misleading before letting us know what really happened and who the killer is. I found the characters to be predictable from The tracker/hunter male that's good at everything And always figures it out before the young female law enforcement character that's in over her head. Throw in the local cop that's a bit slow and blasé about his job. It's been done a 100 + times and I think it's been done better. I'm actually starting to wonder whose reviewing movies. I'm sorry but 8/10 on IMDb when there's many many more movies that score 6/10 that have better story, writing and acting. Was this movie awful? No. It's not a terrible movie but it's definitely just average.",2017
6,"Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River got good acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks is imo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind River a thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about loss and being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting.

5,"Atmospheric, capable thriller but feels shopworn and its production marred by TV-style shot selection and editing. Story of Indian reservation killing is chock-a-block with grim and squalid images we've seen in other stories with same old Hollywood virtue-signaling about awful white man's depredations. Two leads are adequate but nothing remarkable in the writing to lift or distinguish their characters. We've seen it before. Hunter/tracker Renner offers awkward exposition speech about his family tragedy (we know its coming, and it does not come seamlessly for the story). Scenes of brutality are fairly predictable, and so are the antagonists. For great take on murder on Indian reservation story check out Thunderheart.",2017
10,"An FBI agent teams with a town's veteran game tracker to investigate a murder that occurred on a Native American reservation. Wind River was one of those films that i did not expect to actually go and see in Theaters but i'm so glad that i did this is a small budget indie movie and something very much different than Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen usually do especially since they both star in 'Avengers'. This is more of a character study drama than your regular action film and it packs some great heavy performances especially from the 2 main leads in fact Renner delivers his lines with a terrific way, his role isn't just dramatic but he can pull some actual punches of his own both as an actor and as a character, Olsen is kind of the rookie type of character but she is not weak or a character that is annoying in a sense of way she can actually pull off the acting chops just as good as Renner and both of them should get nominated for something until the end of the year, Gil Birmingham and Graham Greene also gave 2 terrific performances as well and you do get some great moments from the Native American Culture. Like i said this is more of a character study drama about fathers and daughters and how a parent learns how to overcome or basically try to understand that his child won't come back also there are some great suspenseful scenes and some really great action sequences that will totally blow you away, the direction that the movie takes is very good and it's full of great shots left and right plus there's an unexpected cameo from a fan favorite actor and the whole 'who did it' scenario is clever even tho we have seen it many times before. Overall this is a great movie and i would totally recommend you to go and see it in Theaters but just know what to expect this isn't Avengers 3 it's a film about an awful tragedy and a bunch of brave people who wanna know what the hell happened. (A+)",2017
3,3 is as generous as I can get on this review.,2017
10,"Shocking even myself I have nothing negative to say about this movie (never happened before). As for style I would say its taken its stylish rendering from Nordic Noir, bringing in the snow as a major player in the movie. The atmosphere is brooding enough to make the point without overdoing it. The plot would be best described as 'real/not contrived' as opposed to simple - but simple it is. Perfectly executed, poignant, very adult, amazing production, excellent acting (big line up of well known names... and... everyone in this carried off their role to award winning levels - sort of thing the Coen brothers were known for). And who doesn't love a well done revenge movie? (This movie is many things, but its that also). Highly recommend this (side note for a scene that might make some uncomfortable), it's brilliant!",2017
3,I'm at a loss to see why this film has been well reviewed.,2017
8,"They say living well's the best revenge but there's also something very satisfying about good ol' bloody revenge itself, at least in the movies. Wind River"" takes us back in the tough working-class Americana in the middle of nowhere that often makes for an exciting drama and/or action. The people are tough and bitter, nobody plays around, the punches are thrown hard, and even the strongest characters edge at the brink of darkness. A game tracker (Jeremy Renner) teams with FBI agent (Elisaberth Olsen) to investigate a murder that occurred on a Native American reservation. There's a bunch of smaller characters around but it's very much about them two, or rather the tracker guy alone. If you have seen (among others) Winter's Bone"", A Single Shot"", Justified"" or any other story of this type, you can already guess what you're in for. I would compare Wind River"" mostly to 2013's A Single Shot"" starring Sam Rockwell, this being mostly about one unlikely male hero who has to take matters into his own hands, with a little exciting violence in the end. And both are also about mental and physical isolation, and solving stuff alone. Having written that, an early Nolan work Insomnia"" also sprung to mind for comparison, which was my favorite Nolan until the mighty Dunkirk"" arrived. The movie's mostly about building – characters, their state of mind, sense of place, mood, suspense. The aim is not to dispense fast pleasures or easily digestible entertainment, and there's no need for that, because once you are able to invest yourself in the story, you'll probably agree that screenwriter and debuting director Taylor Sheridan is very able to pull it all off. Everybody's not gonna be happy about how they have built up the explosive finale, but I liked it. No problems with that kind of approach, at least in this case. Acting is very good all around, with delicate, nuanceful, and well measured performances from everybody from the central hero to the smallest characters on-screen. Wind River"" is a cool directorial debut from Taylor Sheridan, who has previously acted in TV but also written screenplays for Sicario"" and Hell or High Water"", both unfortunately unwatched by me (and most others) so far. But both have received encouraging word of mouth, and Wind River"" makes me want to see these even more. It's a good TV series quality drama, which is highest honor an American movie can receive in 2017. Bleak and depressing but ultimately satisfying stuff.",2017
5,"Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. This is the guy who wrote HELL OR HIGH WATER and SICARIO, so you know what to expect. It's a very slow movie, taking place in a snowy Native American reservation. A young FBI female agent is sent to investigate a death.",2017
5,"Sure, this movie has some stuff going for it. The scenery is beautiful, cinematography is fine, Jeremy Renner is a likable guy, Elizabeth Olsen is pretty, and the local cop/sheriff (played by Graham Greene) is a believable character who acts like an actual human being. Too bad he's the only one. Wind River - even more so than Hell or High Water (written by the same guy) - is filled with dialogue where people talk in metaphors, where there's always a deeper meaning to what they say, in other words, it doesn't sound like normal, everyday people talking to each other. If they only did that in certain key moments, it would be fine, it could work if that's what the story demands. But when that's all you hear throughout the whole film, it becomes pretentious and irritating. ",2017
4,"Director Sheridan wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water, two of the most thoughtfully intense films of the last couple years, but this is (essentially) his directing debut. However, somehow he seems to have focused so much on the beauty of the visuals (which truly are stunning) that the script took a backseat. With a lack of character or distinction, and an unexpected plethora of clichéd storytelling and on-the-nose dialogue, Wind River is little more than a beautiful but ham-fisted allegory of how Native Americans have been poorly treated. Renner and Olsen take a break from their Avengers duties to join up with a local sheriff (scene-stealer Greene) to solve a crime in the frozen tundra of a Wyoming Indian reservation. The mystery itself, a young woman found brutalized and frozen in the woods, is an absorbing one, thanks to the skill in the filmmaking details. A uniquely foreboding score, intensely authentic action, gorgeously gruesome dead bodies atop scenic snow, and a lead hero who displays an aptitude for cool vengeance that should make Liam Neeson proud, all help boost the engagement. Unfortunately, once the mystery is resolved and explained, it's less, ""Woah!"", and more ""Oh"". The appeal of the mystery begins to dissipate when the conclusion is unsatisfying, leaving us with more unintended questions than answers: Why is the camera so shaky during simple dialogue scenes? What's with the hackneyed one-liners? Are these performances nicely subtle, or just dry as a bone? Is this the best we can do to portray the suffering of Indian-Americans? Wind River might have some helpful thoughts on wrestling grief, but it's mostly just unnecessarily brooding and too uncomplicated in its anger.",2017
1,"I want to start by saying that I went into this knowing full well it would not be another ""It's Always Sunny"". The character of Dennis Reynolds exists in that space, and though Glenn Howerton is a large reason as to why so many people watched the pilot episode of this show, it is not right to judge the show for not being Sunny. That is not where my problems with AP Bio lie.",2018
3,"I was rather excited for the new comedy ""A.P. Bio,"" but quickly realized how much of an anticlimactic disappointing mess this show really is. I watched two whole episodes, and it was the biggest waste of 42 minutes. I didn't laugh once, or even smirk. I almost felt like it was perfect to turn on and fall asleep to, but I waited to see if it improved. It didn't. ""A.P. Bio"" is a show that has an incredible lead actor, and really not much else other than that. This show is seriously lacking any interesting stories, as the only ""main"" storyline is for the teacher to get back at his arch-enemy with his students' help (or lack thereof). The lead-in to the teacher getting back at his enemy was to catfish him. The students were not too enthused, as they would rather learn . . . which lead to the ""rap,"" which was . . . well . . . extremely cringe-worthy. Additionally, the only other storyline worth mentioning was the female teachers in the lounge and all I have to say about them is that their sexual references were not funny and they actually made me feel very uncomfortable. I am sorry to say that I will not be spending any more time on this show. I was excited at first, but since found that excitement was nothing but wasted energy. This show is nothing but a showcase for Howerton's immense talent, and that in itself is not enough. Perhaps he should have stayed with ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."" A rating of 3.0/10 is me being extremely generous.",2018

1,"The trailer looked adorable. A philosophy professor who's too cool for school. You'd figure he'd bond with the kids, maybe develop some 3 dimensional characters, show some depth to where the professor's coming from, and, in 2018, make an effort towards generating a diverse cast with new and thoughtful chracters. 
AP Bio does not do that. It's your typical entitled white guy missing the point at every turn, ironically a philosphy scholar despite being incredibly amoral and unethical, but above all, a sexist and mysoginistic jerk who identifies with the white class loner who's secretly an anarchist. Screw the nerds who make an effort to succeed. Honestly, the show does not try hard enough, and I expected so much more from Seth Meyers and Patton Oswalt. I'm not the kind of person to leave scathing reviews that no one's going to read, but honestly, if a one-star review helps the ratings go down then I'll post my one-star review. Avoid the show. It's not worth it and in 2018 we should put our eyes and money on shows that make an effort to reflect the changing social landscape.",2018

If you have been waiting for the gang to make bigger moves and The Mick isn't doing it for you then you are in the right spot. Glenn Howerton brings that charming yet terrifying vibe we missed from the absence of IASIP. He continues some of his best bits from the newer seasons such as using the word ""Bang"", uncontrollable road rage, and staring off into the distance while saying something menacing. If Dennis was your favorite character in IASIP then this show has you covered. The teachers in the break room add a nice touch of ladies to the show and Patton Oswald plays the same character he does in most aspect of his life, except slightly less sad than usual. I have been enjoying the show and hope it gets extended to more than what they called for. It has the same humor that made It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia a cult classic. It may not be for the masses but it is hilarious in it's own way. Don't miss out on this show is you are in need for some dark and touching comedy that fills your dead souls. I have literally lost my breath laughing from some scenes because i'm dead inside but still long for the human emotion of joy.",2018

Most of the SNL sketches I like are the ones at end of the show. I can see if you are looking for a laugh track comedy like Big Bang Theory to sit down and watch with the family or something then this type of programming can come off as off-putting and maybe a little angsty. But as some of the reviewers have already said, it's undoubtedly good casting which makes for some really funny characters (I like the coach and the gals in the teacher's lounge). And of course, his majesty Patton Oswalt is given a pretty great vehicle on this project.",2018

Yes I know it was a revenge story but the characters were so boring it made it a real slog to get through.

1,"THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017) * Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Bill Camp, Alicia Silverstone. Odd, strange and frankly taxing on the nerves sci-fi drama about the very wrong relationship between a teenage loner (creepy as f*** Keoghan) who gloms onto the cardiologist (Farrell in a truly one-note you wanna slap so-hard turn) who was responsible in the death of his father on the operating table unbeknownst to the doctor (at first) until it is revealed that the fate of his family will suffer the wrath of the mysterious boy. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrote the frustrating screenplay with Efthymis Filippou - continues to befuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.Night Shamalan (um, not a good thing at all) - with impossible silent situations and moments where you want to scream at the screen ""Are you ****ing kidding me?!!?""

3,"Not really a fan of Kidman, and this movie is a great example why, I think she donned her Stepford Wive's persona for this one...again.
A heart surgeon has secret meetings with a teenage boy after unsuccessfully operating on his father. The boy somehow makes the Dr's whole family sick as an act of revenge for drinking on the job, Dr must choose which family member to sacrifice...which he does, randomly. During the film, these's lots of hidden messages in the imagery that you must decipher, and most likely will be attributed to the teenager being an incarnation of the devil, or a hundred other ways that it could be interpreted, of which the director will no doubt take credit for, more ambiguity the better for an artsy film, which is really means being too lazy to figure out a more plausible reason that these events could even be put on screen. The dots do not connect, the acting is definitely questionable, and the plot is just hot air, camera work is interesting, a lot of the placement is following the action, as if hovering from behind, similar to 'Birdman'. The film did have me interested in the outcome, I did want to know the reasoning behind all the sickness, and how he was able to predict it, but for a film to be worth watching, it must address it's central question, at least try and answer it, but it doesn't. So yeh it's an 'Art' film, because you have to decide yourself what it all meant, or be able to recount decades of cinematic references that the director was targeting to unravel all the hidden meaning, which may or may not lead to a logical ending. But me expecting a logical satisfying ending to a film (to which there will be no part 2) is no doubt looked upon as ignorant and docile to all the film noir aficionads's. But I felt ripped off after sitting through that, in a really classic 'film noir' way. I once watched a film where a guy took a crap on a wooden cross, and through the wonders of time lapse photography, a rose eventually grew out of the crap, that was at least slightly satisfying to endure, this one wasn't.",2017

A few moments later...happy chatter and munching are gone, everyone is focused, trying to figure out what the story-line is all about, what the GBP 12 for an adult ticket + GBP 7 for popcorn and coke went for.. a tragedy? No, a roadkill! No amount of expensive equipment can make up for the lack of plot! It just doesn't make sense... at all! Any of it! ""But it had scored so well on IMDb!"" - whines someone from the back row and I can feel their pain... it is everyone's pain... A collaborative exhaling in short puffs! What.a.waste.of.time!

Hardly a meaningful statement or emotional reaction over 120 minutes. Close to the worst film I have ever seen. And at the ending will leave you completely unsatisfied.",2017

He's had his Al Pacino SCARFACE comparable with TRAINING DAY, his Robert DeNiro GOODFELLAS comparable with American GANGSTER, and here he gets his Dustin Hoffman RAIN MAN as he plays the titular Roman J.

That spoke so much for his character and he/it did not disappoint. I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants a film that makes you want to strive to be a better person.

I strongly believe that if you are in your sixties and of African-American heritage this may really hit home on many levels. In general it is a film about holding on to our core values, then forgetting them to join the rest of societal madness only to realize that you were not alone in your view of the world. Restoring your original core only to pay the price of deserting it in the first place. Everyday we see people forfeit family,love and life for materialistic gains and other power trips. This is also about the change of values from one generation to another in today's world. This is a film with a message that has and will go over a lot of heads judging by some of the bad reviews I've read. Awesome sound track consisting of 60's and 70's soul and rock.

With this film, he is our most gifted American actor today. Last year at the Golden Globes his mannerism were so idiosyncratic...he must have been still deep inside of this character...most likely, still filming Roman. This film affected me greatly. I am so moved by this character's eccentricity, wit, grace and soul. Brilliant writing and direction. I want to see this picture again.",2017

The entire ordeal breaks Roman, who sells out his ideals and loses sight of who he was.",2017
7,"Gilroy scores big with Denzel. It's one of his MAJOR works of the 21st century and it makes me so pleased to see a guy in his 60s who could/should be resting on his laurels with a challenging human being to nail. He does a metric-ton of work to create a completely distinctive introvert/savant person we have never seen him do before and it shows. But Gilroy needed to work more on the script; events move along far too quickly given how much does happen to/by/from Israel, and I feel mixed not so much on the very end but on the climax (spoiler: it confirms a trope raised many times on the ""Denzel Washington is the Greatest Actor of All Time"" podcast). So it is good, at times very good. But it's a teeny slump after the knockout of Nightcrawler, which this feels like a cousin to. I wonder now if Gilroy will create his own 'LA Mental Case' cinematic universe (one can also tell that these are very much stories of the American dream and how the system work; the TV network and Farrell's legal office are by the books and full of ""normal"" people, and who wants that?)",2017
5,"Denzel Washington can carry a movie and that is the only reason that seeing this movie isn't a complete disappointment. As a Canadian I wondered if the movie never seemed to get out of the gate because I missed Los Angeles cultural nuances that for the conversant made it filled with purpose. I found that the characters had a lot about themselves and their lives that could have been developed, but only the surface was skimmed. Background was in staccato snippets that left a lot on the table in terms of building depth, drawing me in, or giving me a good reason to keep watching. Not all occurrences in the movie were plausible, which is problematic as the movie aims to be realistic. The character of George was unexpectedly interesting, so that added a star to my bottom line.",2017

4,Denzel Washington tries to carry this movie on his back. He is in every scene. The movie is way to long and way too dialogue driven. It's another example of written and directed by going wrong. There are too many walk and talks. Sit and talks. Characters make long speeches and usually say nothing. After about an hour and a half there's an incident that creates a bit of suspense and finally makes things interesting. Problem it is too little too late.,2017
2,"and we watch him prance around the screen, and we keep on getting told that he is really, really smart. Except that nothing he does is particularly smart. Its a completely informed attribute. And then there is just more of this guy bumbling around and we keep on being told how intelligent he is....and I am pretty sure if you started watching the film in the middle, or at the end, it wouldn't change anything. Its kind of clever as a character sketch, except the character is not believable, and doesn't go through any kind of development. Really when you see the trailer you get most everything you need to know about the film handed to you. If the film was a bit less pretentious, and took itself a bit less seriously you could just laugh at it. But it won't let you do that, because serious social issues, and a serious actor!

Written and directed by Dan Gilroy with aplomb and skill in this somewhat implosive 'Falling Down'.

I wanted to and tried to like it, but to say that I did would be a lie. The first half of the movie was interesting and looked like it was building a good story line. Somewhere towards the end, the entire movie just went completely sideways. It started jumping all over the place and was hard to follow. There were scenes with people crying and you didn't know what they were crying about. There was a scene in which Roman and the civil rights lady found what they thought was a dead African American man on the corner. Two police officers pulled up and began to act like complete fools, which gave Roman the opportunity to announce to the world his thoughts on American politics. then the dead guy gets up and walks away.

1,"While watching this farce, I had the uncanny feeling that I'd seen this kind of badly-done portrayal of an apparently autistic savant before. And I was right - Roman J Israel is by the same man who brought us Nightcrawler. While Nightcrawler's depiction of an autistic man seemed based entirely on a bunch of not-too-bright college students' idea of what autistic people are like, Roman J Israel takes it a step further by apparently being based on a particularly dull sixth-grader's understanding of autism. Roman J. Israel, the eponymous lead character, talks like a stupid person's idea of how smart people talk - by using lots of long words put clumsily together. People who're actually smart speak simply, clearly and concisely. Roman just comes across as a village idiot who's spent years memorizing a thesaurus to impress his fellow villagers. ",2018
9,"As many critics have pointed out, this isn't a spoof of Star Trek. It's not exactly an homage either. The best way I can describe it is that MacFarlane wanted to make a Star Trek show that recalls that franchise's earlier days, back before it became an action blockbuster film series and before the TV shows started becoming dark and grim and edgy. MacFarlane is making his own version of the original Star Trek, and he is a new Captain Kirk. All the optimism and sincerity and lightheartedness of that show is here, and in many ways it's kind of wonderful. I'm honestly surprised something like this exists.",2017

When I saw the trailers for this series, I thought; there making Galaxy Quest into a TV show and MacFarlane is producing it? A recipe for disaster... Or so I thought, much to my bewilderment, this series was actually funny and they didn't gloss over the characters. There's actual development. It was refreshing. The show balances drama and humor in a delicate fashion that makes it hard to believe that this is Seth's work. Don't get me wrong, I'm actually a fan of his humor, but his story telling has always lacked a certain facade. The story is about Captain Ed Mercer who gets assigned to a mid-level Intergalactic ship. Where he is appointed his ex-wife as his Executive officer. At it's core the show thrives on it's entertainment value and that is a trait that shouldn't be overlooked. If they can keep the sense of humor and pacing of the series, I believe we are in for a fun ride and at the end of the day that's all we can ask for. If you haven't already, I would recommend seeing Galaxy Quest before/after you see this, there are uncanny similarities and I for one loved it.",2017

But then I watched episode 2 and then 3 and 4 and I still want more. This Show is a comedy but it's not one of these obnoxious ""every sentence must be a joke"" comedies. I also like how very well MacFarlane recreated that TNG feeling about Star Trek without just being a simple copy of it. I often have the awkward feeling that what I'm watching is actually the rightful successor to the previous Star Trek TV shows instead of Star Trek Discovery - If it weren't for the occasional jokes. I like the show and I recommend everyone who likes Sci-Fi and/or comedy to give it a try.",2017

8,"The humor is amusing and the characters are interesting but where the Orville shines is the story. It asks big important questions and then lets the viewer decide the answer. It puts a diverse cast together of humans and aliens and then has their natural differences cause drama as opposed to forcing it. It isn't perfect, but it is on the road to be great. It's sad that this show is a better Trek than Discovery. They need to tone down the gross-out humor a little and we could have a legitimate Trek replacement in this show. I hope it stays on the air for a while.",2017
10,"I don't generally like Seth Macfarlane's work. I'm not a fan of family guy or the like. But I love The Orville. While it can be considered a parody of Star Trek, it embraces this niche and performs excellently. I've seen all of Star Trek more than once, with my least favorite being Enterprise and the new Discovery. I've waiting with bated breath for a new Star Trek series that would satisfy my longing desires for engaging space fairing adventures involving the Alliance. But what The Orville taught me about my love for Star Trek, is that I didn't just want some more cookie cutter Star Trek - recycling familiar family names and phrases to keep die hard fans in the loop. Star Trek Discovery makes just this error, and develops an action like, JJ Abrams-esque universe which is dull and does not push the envelope of human discovery where we as viewers have our imaginations opened up to the endless possibilities of the universe. This sense of adventure and peace-loving discovery was the essence of what made Star Trek shows like Next Generation, Voyager and DS9 so impeccable. Instead we're given just another action sequence What I was really waiting for, was a show that wanted of me, all of my emotions in where I was genuinely engaged and invested into the chemistry of the on screen character's individual alien culture and it's affect on their personal lives. From Isaac discovering what it means to be human (while still being hilariously and ""legendarily racist"") to Bortus' decision to not alter the gender of his first born child. The Orville made me laugh, watch anxiously in fear and anticipation, and expanded my imagination to what infinite possibilities await in the universe,an idea easy to enhance considering the abundance of cultures and lifestyles that exist even on a single planet.",2017
8,"As many reviews mention, this is one of the best examples of a disconnect between professional reviewers and real world audience.",2017
10,"I'm not a big Seth McFarlane fan, but I love what he's doing with the Orville. I never liked Family Guy, and I found A Million Ways to Die in the West to be totally unwatchable. Crude humor is generally a turn- off for me.",2017
10,"I had an awful feeling when I saw the trailer for Star Trek Discovery. I had a good feeling when I saw the trailer to The Orville. It turns out my feelings were correct on both counts. The Orville is a bit of a Star Trek parody, but it is much more. There are a lot of jokes, initially excessive, but most are very well though. I think the only thing missing is a more significant plot. The elements are there (The Krill), but so far the episodes are self-contained. This series is a great pastime and reminds me of Firefly. I hope other sci-fi fans value it before it gets canned.",2017
9,"I wasn't sure about the first, thought the 2nd was better, enjoyed the 3rd and really liked the 4th episode. With Star Trek Discovery starting around the same time, I'm glad The Orville is here as it has more of the 'old school' Star Treks which balances out the darker/grim style of the new Star Trek, Discovery. I'm also really looking forward to see where it goes, as its first few episodes have been nice and varied, while still developing the characters quite well.",2017
9,"The Orville is a great Star Trek spoof that plays it straight. Yes, it's a spoof, but the humor is subtle and not slapsticky (mostly). There is a great wit with the show, but the pilot had a good story and some great characters and was genuinely fun and even a little exciting in spots.",2017
8,"After having seen six episodes of both Star Trek: Discovery and The Orville, I am truly baffled and very positively surprised. Baffled at how, with a budget of millions, the people who made Discovery could not come up with a single interesting character or plot, but instead basically just made The Expanse with Klingons, taking every single thing that is unique, positive, and enjoyable about Star Trek and tossing it out the window. And positively surprised, because, out of the corner I would least have expected it - the filthy, cobwebbed one with the rancid yogurt, in which Seth MacFarlane used to reside for me - comes this gem of a show that takes everything fun, positive, and enjoyable from Trek and runs with it.",2017
10,"Timely, relevant, thought-provoking science fiction with a great dose of humor. Easily one of the most engaging shows on the air right now, bringing a sense of optimism about our future that we're desperately in need of in North America these days. (Thanks, Seth MacFarlane!) If it gets its chance to evolve with a second season I think FOX will end up with a multi-year hit on their hands. ",2017
10,This series is a home run for Netflix. Its a gripping series with superb casting for every character. It is an edge of your seat thriller that grips the audience from the very start. Throughout each episode you are helplessly wondering how Jason Bateman's character will pull through. The writers of the show are spot on with every twist. I highly recommend giving this series a chance and i can't wait for season 2 to come out. From the first episode to the last it is a brilliant masterpiece that deserves better reviews than other people have given. %100 one of the best new series of the year.,2017
10,"To say this series is intense would be an understatement. Be warned: Ozark is not family friendly as it has a multitude of graphic violence, nudity, mature language and sexual themes. Not for children. I am not a big fan of contemporary dramas, but it was Jason Bateman's outstanding performance in The Gift that led me to check out Ozark. And his character Marty Byrde delivers the same smug arrogance as a finance adviser turned greedy money launderer whose circumstances hurdles the patriarch into survival mode, which is tested repeatedly. Laura Linney is brilliant as his unfaithful/neglected wife Wendy Byrde who proves she is as much as an urbane grifter as her husband. Everyone in the cast delivered superb performances. The drama-charged first episode managed to pull me into the entire series and although some of the plot seems downright incredible (disbelief) I was captivated until the end. Look forward to a second season.",2017
10,"I finished bingeing on this show over the last 2 days. All I can say is, ""WOW""! The characters are all interesting and intense as usual from this Netflix release. Again, comparing this series to Breaking Bad is somewhat justified, but with a Bloodline, Gone Girl, kind of feel to it.",2017
6,"The cast and the acting are great. Bateman in particular is very good, I like him in these darker roles. The story makes enough sense that it should work. Direction and cinematography is good. Etc...",2017
10,"07/23/2017 I will finish the last episodes today or tomorrow? I was unsold the first 1/2 hour in due to the overused story line of Mr. Big Time Drug Supplier goes on a killing spree and then dictates the future of a family to the father. Didn't seem real, but after I started it back up again, everything came together. Even though it's fiction, the perception of reality, the ease of real life dialog, the gripping story line is lifelike. Very easy to immerse the viewer into completely. I would rate this series with Breaking Bad, The Sons of Anarchy or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series of 3. It's truly great and the only negative thing that I might offer is that it's all over to quickly, to short/to little for those of us who really love escape entertainment. I've easily watched 100+ movies online since the beginning of 2017, this is my first and only review. You'll love it, I guarantee. Bon Appetit",2017
10,"If you like your shows dark but plausible Ozark would be for you. It has a terrific cast, plausible premise and it builds slowly like a terrific series does. Some scenes are violent and explicit with either gun play or sex. Easi Morales is haunting as Del the drug dealer. It's familiar ground for Bateman and probably one of his better roles but it's Linney who's sticks out like a beautiful diamond among cubic zirconium. Her resume is already impressive but this is not her typical role. Julie Garner is excellent as Ruth the hustler. Jordana Spiro as Rachel raises our interest with a fine, subtle presence and audiences will recognize the house guest, Buddy with a laugh. My favorite cameo comes in episode 3 and proves this Canadian singer has a great sense of humor!",2017
5,"Starts with great promise and great cinematography, albeit gaping plot holes, draws you in but disappoints with ludicrous plot-twists that fail to suspend disbelief. Towards the end the plot line meanders and ultimately fizzles out, the character interactions unbelievable and just plain dumb.",2017
3,"Ozark is a story of a dysfunctional family having to move to the Missouri Ozarks so that the dad can re-launder a huge amount of cash for a drug cartel his business partners stole from without his knowledge. The mob boss' reason for having him re-launder, despite the money being clean already, is feeble and adds no genuine notion to the entire premise of the series. The family features a weird boy who studies vultures eating dead things, a spoilt teenage girl who thinks she knows everything, a mother who had an affair prior to the move and a dad who is a money laundering criminal who likes watching a sex tape of his wife porking another man.",2017
8,Obvi the main attraction here is Bateman. But honestly the first episode knocks it out of the park. This isn't like your cable network shows where it takes an entire season to get to the good stuff. You're basically getting a explosive bukkake out of the gate. Very tense and dark. The directing makes every scene moody and depressing.,2017
8,This series has so much potential and has a decent cast. I think the history of the characters were rushed and some of the plot was not as detailed as it should have been. This series could be a huge hit in the coming seasons if it had deeper connected characters. A great example of this would be the TV series Justified. Overall the story line has great capabilities and the ideas within the plot are refreshing but there is room for improvement.,2017
1,-Characters in this show expose their most deep secrets like it's nothing: ,2017
5,"The pilot was well done and pulled me right in. The plot points presented in that first episode were interesting and seemed pretty well thought out. The acting was good, Bateman in particular added a new note or two his normally one-note predictability. The camera work was engrossing. The setup was there for a good noir. Unfortunately each following episode increasingly spirals downward in credibility and competence. The casting is off, plot holes increase in size as the story stumbles along and the writers did just what I feared they would do. Turned the ""southern"" characters into cartoons. A simple rule for writers anywhere, if you don't understand the south and its subtleties, don't write about it. Particularly if you're trying to create a story with depth.",2017
9,I'm half way through episode three and I've come back here to review previously reviewed comments. One reviewer likened it to Breaking Bad but different and I totally agree.,2017
3,"Thought it could be an interesting drama, it turns out to be a depressing, unbelievable, and ridiculous situation-filled series. Although it seems to be a talented cast, the characters are frequently annoying, oftentimes offensive, and never seem to learn from any of their choices. Many of the situations seem unrealistic and overly sensational, to the point of eye-rolling.",2017
4,"This show has got it all - sex, drugs, violence, murder - and yet it's still quite boring. The story revolves around characters making highly nonsensical decisions. As much as I like Jason Bateman, his performance felt wooden much of the time. A number of scenes (such as the ""spanking"" scene) seemed forced and very unnatural, almost cringey. I kept watching because of all the glowing reviews but it ended up taking 1 1/2 months for me to get through it all.",2017
1,"I'm on Episode 4, desperately hoping this annoying series will somehow get better and raise itself out of the garbage hole that it has seemed to have inexorably wandered into.",2017
7,"Jason stars in and directs the first 2 episodes - he sets down the characters, the mood and the pace.",2017
7,I will echo that this show has potential but falls short. There is little to no character development. I would not compare it to Breaking Bad which is much more complex and original. The acting just doesn't compare and it is relentlessly dark. There are no moments of humor to make it more true to real life. There are a lot of moments that left me shaking my head. ,2017
2,"The story line is unoriginal, characters stereotyped, overplayed swearing, and a denigration to Missouri citizens and the FBI. Jason Batemans character is as believable as Gomer Pyle, and that goes for the rest of the cast -- you expect the viewers to believe this? I do not understand the high ratings unless you enjoy watching gay sex and and BJs in strip joints. If I was to grade the writers, I would give a ""C-"" for originality and an ""A"" for appealing to 18-year old boys.",2017
1,I would rather peer through my neighbor's bathroom window and watch him squeeze one out than re-watch Ozark.,2017
1,"I struggled through episode one, over three nights. I then tried to force myself to watch episode 2, at which point I came to my senses and stopped the audio-visual torture. In no way is this show captivating. The characters are all odious, the plot is farcical and the acting is drab.",2017
5,This is not at all at the level of great shows. It is watchable but I'd say it is definitely a second tier show good to release in summer when nothing else is on. ,2017
9,"Godless has a long list of actors who do a great job working with a wonderful director and a great screenplay presenting a very interesting story. The tale in this movie has been told before. A good example of a very similar story is the 1968 movie ""Blue"" (see information about Blue on IMDb) where a young gang member decides to leave the criminals he grew up with and start a new life; and then is pursued by his former bunch of hooligans, resulting in significant consequences for some innocent folks.",2017
10,"This is one of the best western series in the recent years. Well scripted and acted. This has everything a good series warrants and feels like a 7+ hour treat. Personally, I liked this a tiny bit better than Deadwood and Hell on Wheels. I hope Netflix keeps producing more of these quality ones. Jack O'Connell shines in the lead role, as does most of the cast. Well done Scott Frank for such an engaging story line and script.",2017
9,What a gem this is. You gotta thank Netflix for letting this creation blossom and see the light of day. Scott Frank did a fantastic job here; the story is very intriguing and one of the best character building in recent westerns. The direction and cinematography are top notch. It is undeniable that we have a classic on our hands.,2017
10,"I found this series to be excellent. Scott Frank found a way to make a tired genre come alive for a more modern audience. The cast was excellent, with Jeff Daniels creating a formidable villain. Flashbacks reveal the source of his villainy to lie in the violence of his own childhood, the loss of his ""mammy and pappy"" and his religious extremism. That he is mentally disturbed is clear, but his childhood story both resembles and provides a contrast to that of Roy Goode in a way that moves the series toward its many lessons of redemption and love. Griffin is ruthless and obsessed --in ways that remind us of the extremism of some in today's society both here and around the world. His false and twisted idea of ""family"" contrasts with that of Alice Fletcher or Mary Agnes, who owns hard life experiences lead them to find real family, one based on more positive values. It is the message the late-arriving preacher gives at the funeral, one I found quite moving. It is the message Roy Goode came to find. ",2017
5,Spoilers Ahead:::,2017
9,"Quite a good movie which hits all of the buttons for a classic western.! The violence was a little high and very realistic, which is my only real problem with it. Interesting to note that the reviewers who didn't like it had a problem with the inter-racial relationship as well as the lesbian relationship. I thought that these brought a note of realism to it, as these relationships have been going on forever, but social mores kept them from being portrayed in the past. The cinematography was excellent and I found myself just looking at the scenery in some spots instead of following the plot. The casting of little known, but excellent actors, topped off the film, and Michelle Dockery sure is a natural beauty.!",2017
10,"I am hooked by a series on Netflix called 'Godless' I'm now on episode 4 since last night and I can honestly say that it is one of the best Westerns I have seen for a long time since the likes of John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Gary Cooper etc. ",2017
10,Excellent tale well told. Great cast - great screenplay - great music - great costumes - great cinematography. A thoroughly satisfying viewing experience. Definitely among the best films of the western genre. My hats off and I thank all who were involved in bringing this story to the screen.,2017
5,"I think what this series strove to be was a modern twist on the Ford/Wayne classic ""The Searchers?"" and/or the Leone/Eastwood trilogy. It had the same overriding theme of the former, a protagonist who is simultaneously the salvation for civilization but a necessary outsider to it himself, and the slow scenes, interesting camera angles, and mysterious motivations of the latter. Added to this are the modern themes of lesbianism, women's rights, interracial relationships, identity/""daddy"" issues (Frank/Roy, Roy/Truckee), crazed spiritual mumbo-jumbo, and so on.",2018
9,"If someone would have told me the plot of this show, I would have said nah I'm not watching it. Since no one told me and I'm a sucker for westerns, I did and by god am I glad I did. This show is fantastic! The music is some of the best I've heard in a TV show. The flow is great, the characters have character, the story is so well told. The cast were amazing, I couldn't find anyone to dislike in terms of their character. ",2017
6,Godless had the potential to be a great series. It started off incredibly well and then it just gets slow and lazy.,2017
7,"I have to say that for the most part this series had some truly great moments. The tale gets off to a very good start, but soon after, i was starting to ponder if this story goes any deeper, and have some nice surprises for me down the road. At episode 4 i was starting to wonder if this entire series was like it already had been portrayed, with too many coincidences happening, too many predictable outcomes, shallow characters, and being incredibly politically correct.",2017
6,"Great ambiance and a ""western"" feeling I liked a lot. It did remind me of Deadwood. Great performance from Dockery who I had only seen in Downton. O'connell also did a great job as did many others. I was really excited to watch the final episode to see the expected fireworks and who lived, if Dockery & O'connell's characters made a lasting connection, and so on. ",2017
4,"A convoluted tale of redemption and revenge with plot holes aplenty. Everyone was was referred to as sir or ma'am, even the outlaws were polite. The production company seemed to be on a mission to karmic- ally make amends for the TV series Deadwood.The Buffalo Soldiers turned farmers were never called or even referred to as n------s. The white woman who married an Indian and had a mixed race child or her son were never ridiculed. The lesbians weren't ostracized. A former prostitute was even welcomed as the new school marm. The production company ran out of love when it came to the Mormons. They were portrayed as rapists, torturers and murders with no explanation for it.",2017
5,"If you enjoy gratuitous violence, an erratic story that jumps all over the place, then this series is for you! It's not for me. Because of the excellent acting and filmography I give it a 5, but sure won't be watching the other episodes. Do not believe those who say this is a ""pure western"" much less ""classic"". If the Old West had been like this no one would have survived into the 21st century.",2017
10,"As a fan of westerns I thought this was very well done. Yes, there are clichés but what modern western or any western doesn't have them? Give it a chance. I think you will not be disappointed. It is a guilty pleasure to binge watch but I pretty much watched all the episodes in two sittings. The scenery and cinematography are breathtaking and the acting is first rate. Using modern technology to tell an ages old story definitely kept me interested. Yet it wasn't overused and never seemed too modern. (The Magnificent Seven remake comes to mind) I don't write many reviews but I thought this one was worth the input. Enjoy!",2017
7,"This limited series is a straightforward Western with a great cast, high production value and is beautifully shot. It hits all the buttons you expect from a Western and leaves no cliché untouched. If you are a Western fan, then this show is for you.",2017
5,"The filming and scenery is amazing, that gets a solid 9 out of 10 just so people don't think i'm complaining about that, infact if you want a good looking western this is recommended, but the story..",2017
7,"Everywhere I read ""it is the best series Netflix has produced"" or ""brilliant"". Then why do I feel a little empty? Not dissatisfied, but disappointed that its potential has been partially wasted.",2017
8,"First and last episode were both very violent, but never as much as Bone Tomahawk - another recent Western. This is a typical Western, with a few twists (like a town without men). If you are a fan of Merritt Wever (Nurse Jackie), she continues to weave her magic as scene stealer extraordinaire. Jeff Daniels is better here than I ever remember him being. Basically, if you like Westerns, It is worth your while. If you don't, then watch if for Wever or Daniel or Dockery, if you particularly like those actors.",2017
7,"At first glance this has all the ingredients of a decent western showdown. A murderous villain and his gang of crooks, a mysterious gunslinger and a town in trouble on the edge of desperation. The show's historical hiccups and unrealistically distorted characters give it it's lower rating. As usual with these things the bloody violence of the old west is played up. The female de-facto leader of the town brazenly sports men's clothing, defies her male peers at every turn and has an openly lesbian relationship. Now while such a character is interesting to insert into the period, the show falls down by making this character relatively easily accepted by the others. While there are a few examples in the old west of women taking on some similar attitudes they were totally ostracised at best and actively persecuted at worst. They were certainly never community leaders. This kind of prejudice would've been a huge aspect of old west society and failure to reflect this accurately is a huge let down for the show. The gunslinging male protagonist does suffer the faults of the classic western hero, his character is very much a mary sue, capable of fighting off over two dozen men and seemingly a savant talented in every area. This *is* a classic western trope, however it feels as though the show could have taken the opportunity to create a more balanced character. Overall it's definitely still watchable, but that doesn't change the fact that many parts of it feel like it just doesn't fit",2017
7,"Standard derivative western. Shades of Shane (in my opinion). As a 1 season (?) series, they used a lot of filler. Back stories. 1 character wanders around a lot seemingly aimlessly. During gun fights the usual Hollywood anatomical stupidity of shoulder, leg and thigh wounds. Oh and gut shots. ""Just a flesh wound"" attitude. OH? SOMEONE CALL A TRAUMA SURGEON! Yeah I get it: This is all fiction. They DID get the hats right: Fallacy that everyone wore cowboy hats back then. More people had rifles than 6 shooters. As for the plot slightly new idea but they milked for a series. The supernatural aspect of it was good. I believe that Jack O'Connoll was NOT a very good lead for the film. Someone more rugged looking would have been better cast. Larger. O'Connoll seemed a bit wimpy for the part. In the climactic scene it was ludicrous how many men were shot. Estimated 30 but seemed more like a 100. Despite all that, I give it a 7 for being a fairly good but predictable western. Hard to find original material these days.",2017
7,I was surprised on two counts...,2017
1,"I don't understand how anyone can enjoy this swill. With the cast and money spent on the production it should (could) have been amazing. Extremely poor directing! Scott Frank is an very good writer, he need to stick with that and give up directing. Yet another huge waste of time and money from Netflix.",2017

1,"As a huge fan of comedies that bring some laughs and escape to this world, and as a huge fan of well-known stars letting their hair down and having goofy fun in an R-rated, raunchy romp, I couldn't wait to see this sequel to ""Bad Moms,"" which I mostly loved and have now watched multiple times. Adding Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, and Cheryl Hines to the original cast seemed like a perfect match--how could it go wrong? In my mind just letting this group of talented actors improvise on the same set would guarantee big laughs, especially with Kathryn Hahn sparking the mix. I went to a ""paid advance screening"" a week before it opened to the public, plunking down my bucks without any fear of first checking reviews--I was that sure it would be at the very least filled with some laugh-out-loud moments, and plenty of amusing ones, well worth my time and money. Imagine my surprise, and disappointment, to find that the film is loaded with tired clichés of mother-daughter relationship problems, with nothing fresh or funny to offer, old jokes and sitcom situations you've seen done (much) better dozens of times on most any TV family sitcom, and that the script is so poorly-written it truly would've been better to just give the actors an overview of what the film was about and let them improv the whole thing. Finally it ends, and you're left with an almost embarrassing dance/romp during the closing credits that is supposed to be a celebration of the ""joy"" of the film and its production and cast, with the actors having a bit of an on-screen dance party as the credits roll. Instead of feeling that (forced) joy, I left the theater depressed and saddened at the waste of money and talent, and the waste of my time and money as well. Easily, for me, one of the worst ""comedies"" I've ever seen--and I've seen hundreds over the decades and my lifetime.",2017
1,"This was unquestionably the absolute worst movie I have ever spent my heard earned money on, and I have never wished for a refund so much in all my movie-going years. While I wanted to walk out after the first 15 minutes, I instead chose to continue to wait, thinking that at some point soon the movie would get better and be worthy of some words of praise or at least one commendation. However, by mid- movie it was clear that this movie was only spiraling from bad to worse, and I would have walked out had I not been accompanied by the friend who chose for us to see it. It was ridiculous from start to finish, and not the least bit funny. I was just beyond embarrassed for these otherwise noteworthy actors. Truly, it was so awful that I kept waiting for the movie theater people to jump out from behind the screen and say ""Gotcha,"" and then start the real movie, but sadly, it was not to be. ",2017

5,"A Bad Moms Christmas may have fell into that comedy sequel flaw were the first movie was pure laughs and fun. And this sequel may have some moments were it can be funny, but overall it fell a little boring compared to the first movie. I enjoyed the first with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn playing mothers who are so overworked and unappreciated. They decide to take control of their own lives to have a little fun. Sure, there are some hilarious moments in this film. But it was not enough to carry the rest of the movie. ",2017
1,"Loved the original, paid to see it three times at a theater. This is (for me) the WORST film of the year. The characters, particularly Hahn and Sarandons are repugnant, repellent and even I am embarrassed for them. What a waste of a terrific cast! I laughed ONCE (a joke about Sarandon's characters name) and that was it. I was really looking forward to this, but sadly, it seems as if the first film was a fluke or just dumb luck that it turned out as well as it did. I love raunchy R rated comedy but this Bad Mom is one BAD MOTHAH! 1/10.",2017
3,"BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD TEAR THIS APART! I went to see this yesterday for some Christmas cheer and I got this piece of crap excuse for a holiday movie.

It revolves around Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn and the arrival of their mothers Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and Christine Baranski. ALL ACTRESS WHOM I ADORE! But the script was just stupid stupid stupid. NOT funny and the characters downright unlikable. I absolutely love the actress Kathryn Hahn but having her and her mom (Susan Sarandon) out in front of a store with a basket that says ""Canned goods donations"" where they proceed to aggressively STEAL GROCERIES from the bags of people who exit the store, open a bottle of wine and drink it in the parking lot makes them not only UNLIKEABLE but not funny and pathetic.

After feeling out our moms (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn) in the first film, I really now see and understand how the unique characters bring out the most in one another, and it felt more organic as a result. The 104-minute run time felt just fine to me and not overlong, but there was one subplot of this film I still could have done without and did not add much to the story, and removing it would have brought it down to a tight 90 minutes.",2017

The previous part was acceptable but not this on
I suggest you not waste your time and watch another movie instade",2018
1,"The first installment had charm and was funny. This one is unspeakably dumb, unfunny, charmless, unpleasant, badly written, badly acted, to the point where you are embarrassed for the actors (Susan Sarandon? Kristen Bell? Peter Gallagher?). Do not subsidize this monstrosity with your time and/or money.",2018
3,A Bad Moms Christmas,2017
2,"The prototypical example of what happens when female characters are written and directed by clueless men. With six supremely talented female actors leading this movie, it nevertheless ends up being a shallow and even embarrassing caricature of females in general and mother-and-daughter relationships in particular. Too many of the setups and resolutions between the women in this movie undermine everything female actors have been begging for in the way of good film roles for women. I was just depressed after enduring this unfunny holiday tale. And I'm a male. So there.",2017
8,"A Bad Moms Christmas is a sequel to Bad Moms(2016). Amy(Mila Kunis), Kiki(Kristen Bell) & Carla(Kathryn Hahn) are stressing out about Christmas. As mothers, all the expectations are on them to make sure that their families have the perfect Christmas. To add to the pressure, their mothers decide to drop by for a surprise visit. ",2017
5,"If you really enjoyed the original Bad Moms it should be no surprise that this one was not as good. With most comedy sequels we tend to watch them because we really liked the characters not because there's any type of story that needs to be continued. I mean if you look at The Hangover movies more than one wasn't really necessary but the characters were so likable they knew they could continue with them. Bad Moms is pretty much the same. I felt the characters were just as likable this time around though not as naturally funny. At times the comedy was forced and was basically a rehash of the first one with Christmas thrown in. However I did like adding their moms to the mix. Susan Sarandon as Kathryn Hahn's mom in particular was one of the more funny ones because they were so similar. It was also a pretty enjoyable Christmas movie and kind of got me in the Christmas spirit even though Halloween literally just ended. Obviously it's not an It's a Wonderful Life classic but a good Christmas comedy. Overall I like the theme of a film being called Bad Moms when they're all trying pretty hard to be good moms that just realize they can never be perfect. I like that most moms can relate to at least one of the characters. And yes if they made a third called Bad Grandmas which they pretty much made it look like they would, or at least could, I would see it.",2017
7,"This movie was such fun! Even though my friend and I were both blessed with fabulous mothers, she and I have both known far too many girlfriends who have quite contentious relationships with moms who don't have a clue. This movie rang so true for us! Three modern-day moms are trying to do the best they can, with two being single moms. Their mothers all decide to come for the holidays - after all, who can deny family at that time of year? And, being good daughters, the young women try to be hospitable while their moms trample all over their daughters' plans. Hilarious fun for a girls' night out!",2017
3,"""A Bad Moms Christmas"" (2017 release; 104 min.) brings more from the original ""bad moms"". As the movie opens, we once again hear Amy introduce the story. ""I am Amy Mitchell and I just ruined this year's Christmas"" she tells us, amidst what appears to be a war zone in her house (and a camel walking by!). We then go back in time to ""6 Days Before Christmas"", where the story begins as Amy gets ready for Christmas and things start going wrong when her parents, and in particular her domineering mom, show up. In parallel stories, Kiki and Carla also get visited by their moms. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
3,"Before anything I want to say having been suicidal once myself; if you as a viewer feel you can relate to Hannah and have any thoughts on it yourself, please seek help. There are people everywhere willing to give it, you just should look outside the circle of people you see everyday. Life is so much more than high school and things always eventually turn around. You are stronger than anyone may have you believe.",2017
2,"When I first watched this Netflix series, I have to admit I found the premise extremely intriguing and watched the entire series from start to finish in two days. Aside from feeling somewhat depressed following the final episode, I initially was impressed with the efforts the production team had gone to in making this series a highly compelling viewing experience for the viewer. Some of the acting was excellent and the soundtrack was a perfect blend between the 80's and contemporary music and it is for this reason and this reason alone that I am awarding it two stars.",2017
1,"The thing I found the most sick about this show is that Hannah Baker,  one of the main characters is literally stupid and insane! Seriously  people! I will give you an example, one of the characters, I forgot his  name because the shows characters are very boring and one dimensional,  put Hannah Baker's name on a list for having a nice butt. And what does  Hannah do? She goes on to torture this poor kid and put his name on a  tape as a reason for her suicide! The boy is clearly affected by her  suicide enough but because of Hannah's tape he psychologically wasn't  able to deal with it anymore and goes on commit his own suicide a few  days later! And having your name on a list for having a nice behind is  a reason to kill yourself?! Really???  Our other main protagonist Clay, is also deeply affected by her suicide  so bad he is constantly having flashbacks in class to the point of  where he is having outbursts in front of his peers. Now if that isn't  bad enough Hannah puts Clay on the tape and now throughout the show he  is constantly worrying about what he did wrong to take part in Hannah's  death and is repeatedly told by the other characters he has to watch  his tape. In fact, he asks one of the characters, I think his name was  Tony, was Hannah Baker killing herself Clay's fault and Tony replied  yes. But guess what! Clay did absolutely nothing! That's right! Nothing  at all!   Now this show completely strings you along for around 12 episodes to  believe Clay did something bad, but nooo there wasn't even any reason  for him to be on the tapes at all! As a matter of fact Clay even tried  to help Hannah but she literally told him to go the F*** away! What  sense does that make! As a matter of fact, she said the same thing to  another character who tried to help her too!   Something else that was completely stupid and messed up is that Hannah  Baker victimizes herself so bad that she literally sits in a closet and  does nothing while her friend is raped! She doesn't try and stop it or  get help and the thing is if she did she could have actually prevented  her own rape! Hannah also goes on to put the friend that was raped on  one her tapes so she could relive her rape. Sadistic right? And then  when she saw said rapist get in a hot tub with her of which she knew  what they fully capable of she chose not to get out of there  immediately? Come on Hannah!  A thing that made no sense to me is that Hannah literally made a  completely dumb decision of going to the party in the first place! Why  would you go to a party where almost everyone there hates you? You  could have asked to gone somewhere else with Clay but nope Hannah once  again does something completely stupid.   Hannah and her actions and completely idiotic. You have a stalker  taking pictures of you outside of your bedroom window? Great let me get  in a bed half naked in my bedroom and make out with one of my friends.  What?   Hannah's narrations also came off as very pretentious and condescending  to me. I am a 16 year old girl in high school and I found her terribly  unrelatable. And this is coming from someone who has gone through  suicidal thoughts, bullying, and sexual harassment. As a matter of fact  I found myself fast forwarding a lot of this show because the dialogue  was just soooo sloowww and boring! It got painfully bad to watch at  times.  This show not only suffered from a dumb main character but really  almost all of the characters in the show happened to be dumb or more  dumb than Hannah herself. An example the girl who had 2 gay dads but  was scared to come out as gay. Or how the parents or teachers in this  show have no idea as to what goes on in their kid's lives.   Honestly, this show can just be completely described as unrealistic as  a whole. The dialogue, the characters, everything! The boys in this  show were just portrayed as caring about ""Having sex, getting drunk,  and partying it up bro!"" I kid you not. They had no feelings or  thoughts at all!   Overall as a teenage girl I found this show to be a complete hit and  miss as it really had the power to speak on suicide to young people  however the writing was completely abysmal and did a horrid job. I  watched this show because my friend told me that it was ""one of the  best shows on Netflix"" and ""was one of the shows that would make you  cry"". The only reason I came close to crying was because of the hours I  wasted watching this show. A lot of people my age are watching this 13  Reasons Why and I am scared because the only lesson to be learned from  this show is to victimize yourself.",2017
3,"The audience is almost set up with the promise of delivering some huge  answer to the reason for the suicide. The problem is that the delivery  is never made. Yes, I'm aware that rape, suicide, bullying, etc. are  all very big problems that need work. But we are aware of this at the  beginning, and we're left at the ending being in the same position.  There was no surprise. No big mystery. Throughout the series though, we  are promised that it is a very big mystery that will soon be unraveled.  However, we find out that it's just a life many people have lived  through choosing not to off themselves. Really the problem here was the  setup that this was some big surprise ending mystery. It's not. You  know where it's going, and it's very predictable. That in itself is a  problem, but there's more issues here.  1. We are promised that Clay did something terrible to Hannah on the  tapes. It's one of the main points made of why Clay takes forever in  finishing them, and other characters frequently point out to Clay that  he shouldn't be blaming people considering what the tapes said he did.  The problem? Clay did nothing! Plot hole? Don't mind that, because rape  and suicide and stuff is a big problem. Whatever.  2. Why is Tony so cryptic? The series points this out several times,  even calling Tony ""unhelpful Yoda."" Tony's reasoning? Just listen to  the tapes and you will get it. The problem? We still don't get it after  listening to the tapes. There was zero point in you not just telling  Clay. In fact, Tony was even aware that Clay did nothing. Even though  Tony wants to ""honor Hannah's wishes"" or whatever, this reasoning is  just a gimmick that's used to continue to plot but never really makes  sense.   3. Clay never blames Hannah. Look, I get it. He wants a scapegoat. He  even blames himself for doing nothing wrong. (What?!!!) Instead of  blaming Hannah, he comes to the conclusion that he should not take no  for an answer when somebody tells him to leave them alone. Is this  sound reasoning? Not really. In fact, not leaving people alone was part  of what drove Hannah to kill herself.   4. What's the point? The moral seems muddled. We get that we shouldn't  be mean to each other. But we should also bother the hell out of people  because they may be lonely and afraid and seeking your help. How does  this work? Is the point just that life contains these horrible  experiences, and we can never really know how to act because it could  end up paving the road to hell with our good intentions? That's what I  got. Bad things happen in life. We can't do a lot to change it, but we  should try to be good most of the time to other people. Fair enough.  That doesn't mean that these things will end, though. Is that the  point? Just accept terrible things happen?  5. Slow pacing! We keep getting to many questions, and almost every  answer leaves me unsatisfied. Just because I can relate to the answer  doesn't bury the fact that I was promised more than than this.  6. Too many people were blamed that really were not responsible. Take a  moment to think about this. She blamed a guy for publishing her poem  under an anonymous name without permission. What?! I get it. Probably  not the right thing to do. It even lead to more harassment. Still, it's  a bit over the top to reach this far for blame. When you think about  it, several characters are blamed for doing something that lead to  something else and so on until it lead to the terrible thing. Of course  anybody on this chain of events is at fault, right? Going all the way  back to your great great great grandparents for even bringing you into  this world. To make things worse, Hannah blames Ryan for going too far  in trying to help her, but blames several characters for not going too  far enough to help her. She blames people for not chasing her out into  the street begging to know what's eating at her heart. So, Hannah is a  bit Utopian and stupid. That leads me to...   7. Hannah is stupid. This point is brought up several times. Hannah  expects a perfect world. Anytime her life doesn't go exactly as  planned, everybody else is at fault. This ain't Utopia, sweetheart.   8. Clay is a weenie. Clay has this superhero complex. He was a complete  Weenie pushover before the death of his love, but after! Watch out for  Clay the bad boy! He's out to take out the trash. Does he even bother  to think that his actions now may cause another person to commit  suicide? No, he never does. (And another kid tries to off himself,  likely because Clay is releasing the tapes) Did Clay learn his lesson?  Nope. All he cares about is avenging his love.  9. All the kids have to learn to deal with the fact they are horrible  people, but the adults never go through this. I think this is more of  an observation about milking the gimmick of teen angst than anything.  The adults never really go through a moment of, ""am I a bad parent?""  (Yes, they all are)  10. What's up with these girls obsessing over Clay? You remember how it  was in high school. The goth girls, all day dreaming about that  poindexter wallflower with Asperger's. The cheerleaders, all waiting  for the moment the geek would ask them to dance? I don't remember that.  You know why? It never happened. That world doesn't exist. Those girls  are usually cruel to a guy like Clay. Your chance comes after high  school, buddy.",2017
5,***Review contains spoilers***,2017
1,"This was so painful to get through, and not because it was dealing with difficult issues but because a lot of the dialogue was so contrived and the main female character, Hannah, was just insufferable, only thought about herself and was really a monster. As a person who has been through a close family member's suicide you do actually blame yourself a lot for a long time, and for the dead person to actually blame these people on tape is just a truly awful thing to do. And basically drove one of the other kids to shoot himself in the head apparently. In the end it is the person who commits suicide who is responsible for their choice and their actions. I'm very sad how this show sort of glorifies suicide as something weirdly beautiful and doesn't actually deal with real mental illnesses and problems. Furthermore, the pace was just irritatingly slow, with Clay, the main character having such a hard time getting through the tapes. And I have to admit I started to skip some parts, mostly Hannahs over-dramatic speeches, because I just wanted to skip to the end and I couldn't take another one of those ""deep speeches"". Also, there really weren't 13 reasons..And to string along a boy you presumably were in love with and who it turns out hadn't done anything wrong for five tapes is just cruel. Well, actually the most awful thing I found about all the info on the tapes was that she stood quietly watching her ex best friend get raped without doing anything, saying anything. And the whole thing about suing people to left and right must just be an American thing that I just don't get. Is that really something you want to waste your energy on, money, instead of dealing with what has happened?",2017
1,***THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***,2017
1,The show has an interesting start dead girl that might not be dead or there is some mystery going on. But NO is just a boring teenage series that touches a big issue in the American society - teenage suicide and bullying.Which in the US obviously is a big issue. Which is why I think 13 Reasons Why has 9.1 on IMDb.The meaning of making a movie or TV show that will touch upon a society problem/s is to make people think about it and maybe take an action to fix it. But this show makes me think what a selfish drama queen is Hannah ( the main character). ,2017
1,"At some point lots of people think about it. Suicide is a complex subject and these 13 episodes almost promote it as solution, some sort of retribution or statement.",2017
3,"Starting this show and throughout the first few episodes, I felt like it was going to be great - things started unravelling one after another in quite a logical order, starting with the less terrible and the more terrible following. But from episode nine, it gets absolutely illogical and terrible. First of, I can't even begin to imagine how it feels when a person close to you kills themselves. You probably do blame yourself for a lot of stuff you which may have not even been your fault. And then she records these tapes to blame everyone around and make them feel even worse? What good can that do? But hey, maybe there is some heavy stuff in there. Well yeah, there is, rape is pretty heavy and causing a deathly accident is, too, but in half of the tapes she just blames people for going away when she told them to do just that. It simply doesn't make sense. Yes, teenagers' minds hardly ever make sense, but I felt like none of those things that happened to Hannah, maybe except one, were strong enough to make a rationally thinking person commit suicide. Excuse me, but if you yell at a guy whilst having sex with him and you tell him to go away, you can hardly expect him to crawl back to you, especially when he hadn't done anything wrong. I feel like this show had a lot of potential which it simply wasted, so I really don't understand, why most of the reviews are so positive about it.",2017
3,"I think I will be one of the few, but I do not support this show's portrayal of issues even though I really wanted to. I'll list just a few reasons why to keep it brief(er). ",2017
1,13 reasons why sucks and here's 13 reasons why,2017
10,"The first thing I want to say before I start, is that I do not binge watch TV series. It's extremely rare for me, and I often don't even finish the season. This TV series had me hooked from start to finish and I spent all day watching it. ",2017
2,"Expected a lot after seeing the reviews... but all i got was tantrums of a teenage girl who thinks she is entitled in some way. Blaming people for your own mistakes really did not make a good story, I mean get a hold of your life lady. Almost every teenager faces these problems, heck I've faced worse.",2017
10,"I've been reading through the reviews and I have to say I am deeply disappointed and concerned with a lot of the reviewers who gave this a poor review. Mostly referring to the lead character as annoying, irritating, a drama queen, blaming others, etc etc etc. It's painfully obvious how much people don't understand about depression and suicide. OBVIOUSLY the lead character has a way down deep issue with coping and then given all the terrible things which happen to her along the way...did not help matters any. Blame the bullies? Blame the teacher who didn't try to help her or contact her parents? Blame the rapist? Of course she is, her brain does not function in the ways the majority of people do. It's is the exact point this show is trying to get across. So many people still have so much to learn about depression and suicidal tendencies. This show opens doors, if only people would try to understand. Talk about this...try to empathize and open your mind to someone who obviously doesn't have the skills to cope in the same way you do. Yes...this was difficult to watch. Coming from the mind of a person who struggles with mental issues on daily basis, it was heart wrenching to get through. I identified with the lead character in so many ways. It's just that I am older and know that while there have been people in my life which scarred me beyond complete repair, ultimately that choice would be on me and not others. However...this is a platform to help raise awareness for this crisis. The cast was impeccable. The show was beautifully done and brutal, as it should have been. Please watch this...and try to understand it's message.",2017
1,"This show is terrible. There's no other way to describe it. It's the product of the stereotypical avacado loving millenial. The entire premise of the show revolves around a hard done by girl wanting to explain why she took her life and make those responsible aware of how horrible they are. In theory a great premise, one that could deliver a powerful and helpful message. However lack luster presentation and terrible acting ruin any positive the show could produce. The ""victim"" has a cold calculated way of talking, one that detracts from the struggles she apparently faces and makes her look as though she killed herself out of revenge, not misery. Which is further enforced by the main plot device. The casette tapes. Do yourself a favor, skip this show completely. This show will give you nothing more than a jaded, uneducated look into suicide. One that i personally find insulting to those who deal with these issues on a daily basis.",2017
3,"As much as I wanted to like the show, it became too soon too clear that it wasn't going to happen. But just like many others I had to finish it, because it does one thing rather well — it intrigues the viewers. This is where the pros end, and too many cons begin. The pace of the show is painfully slow and it certainly doesn't help how repetitive it is in its limited ways of introducing the character behind the tapes and all the bad-bad things that just kept happening to her. Numerous times we have to watch Clay's dull inexpressive face in a state of complete prostration, before we are transferred to another flashback. For some reason, the biggest casting failures had to be the two people the show mainly revolves around: Hannah and Clay. For lack of a better word, acting skills of these two young actors is $hit. And for some even more aggravating reason, their characters are actually the ones that are unfolded and studied least of all. However, if Clay's portrayal can afford to be neglected, Hannah's simply couldn't. The only things I've learnt about Hannah is that she's an attention-seeking, clingy, needy, overly sensitive drama queen, whose judge of character is pure $hit. The only really bad thing that happened to her was sexual assault. And at the risk of being accused of victim-shaming, I've got to say that stripping down to your underwear in the rapist's house doesn't seem like a very reasonable thing to do. Hell, even going to rapist's party alone doesn't seem that smart. But let's jut call it one of the numerous loopholes of the show. One of the others, for instance, is how Hannah is only able to continuously scream and attack people, who don't harm her (Zach and Clay), but when she and her friend are being raped she shuts down and does absolutely nothing. Well, OK, seems legit... And as long as we are discussing Jessica's rape... For some reason Hannah does come to her rescue once, like a true hero she takes drunk Jessica home from the dance and away from awful and terrible Justin, but when someone's raping her unconscious body, she's like ""nah, I'll just sit this one out"". None of Hannah's actions make any sense whatsoever. All her traumas are far- fetched. I realise that some kids may be sensitive, but if a kid can't go through mild high-school drama, there's not much she can handle in her life. As we are led to believe all her problems started with a rumour. I'm sorry, but I simply am not convinced that it could've had this devastatingly heavy and extended impact on her reputation. This Justin story sounds like something that people would forget as soon as someone else made up something else, which I'm sure happened like twenty times a day. Nobody's saying that bullying is normal, but nothing THAT bad happened to her. Hannah's life COULD have been made insufferable by her peers, but it wasn't. All we see is some mild stuff like jocks calling her easy and acting frustrated once they find out she's not. Oh, oh! How could I forget about the list! How traumatic it must be that OF ALL PEOPLE teenage hormonal guys make up a list of hot girls and OH MY GOD call her doable and attractive. It would be easier if the creators made a series of short films on these social problems they wanted to raise awareness of, instead of trying to force everything into one show. I could go on and on about how little sense it all makes. I will do one more, actually. Everyone in that school is an asshole. But there is one really nice guy. Yeah, he gets killed in the car crash. This is such a transparent cheap move, that I'm going to just leave it without any further commenting. There are so many more things to say about this show, but it's not really worth my time. I rated it three stars only because there are some rather talented young actors there: Miles Heizer (Alex), Alisha Boe (Jessica) and Brandon Flynn (Justin Foley). Each got a star from me.",2017
2,Rated two because I watched and wanted to watch until the end.,2017
3,"I find the positive reception that this series received to be truly depressing. Society - at least in the United States of America - must be genuinely sick, that people could enjoy this drivel, and worse, that we are expected (or so I suppose) to empathize or sympathies with the egotistical and irrational main character, Hannah. Unhappily I found myself wishing she had killed herself without leaving the tapes, thus avoiding destroying the lives of so many people around her.",2017
3,"So many mixed feelings about this show but here is my main issue: I don't think she had good enough reason to take her own life, she had plenty of opportunities not to do it but feels like she was looking for an excuse and create unnecessary stress in other's life. The only person who truly deserved it was Bryce, other's were typical stupid teenagers. Not gonna go in all the details, but 4 incidents which truly bugged me aka make me really dislike Hannah.",2017
4,"When i started watching this show, the story seemed pretty intriguing, it was promising and i honestly thought it might go somewhere. But no, instead, what i got was an hour long cringe montage experiment, it's like the show keeps tripping from one embarrassingly awkward scene to the other. The acting is horrible, the character development is shallow and expected, the situations are unrealistic as well as the people; everything feels forced to look and sound more dramatic than it actually is. This is like The Room-level bad, i cannot emphasize enough, do not watch this unless you enjoy long cringing sessions and occasionally screaming into a pillow as an outlet for your frustration. And to make matters worse, with each passing episode, the deceased main character/narrator Hannah adopts a gradually more condescending tone, she straight up points her finger outside the 4th wall and accuses YOU (yes the viewer) of being a direct reason to her suicide cause i dunno maybe you once told her she had a nice behind? or bought her the wrong type of latte? Yup, believe it or not, THESE are the types of things that pushed her towards her end. I remember being legit miffed and wanting to stop watching because of how self centered, a*tistic and cringe this character is, but it's like watching a trainwreck you can't stop looking. Also the movie seems to be trying too hard to make a point about sexism and about how society is engineered from its core to antagonize women and make sure they are always pushed down the hierarchal ladder, but it effing blows it by overstating this constantly. So now WHILE the theme is getting shoved down your throat, you witness an endless parade of unrealistically chauvinist male cast members swinging in and out of screen, talking about ""smashing h*s"" ""chugging brews"" and having nice conversations about racks and MILFs over an extensive buffet of hot wings while beating each other off and watching p*rno on a 20 inch plasma. It's almost THAT exaggerated. The show goes out of its way to illustrate the CIS white male jerk stereotype so you can switch to ""SCR*W ALL WHITE MEN"" mode by the 4th episode. So yeah you get it, the issue is blown way out of proportion, there's a lot of plot holes, SJW cringe compilations, the actors feel dead, 14% of it is believable at most, general try hardiness and tumblr cr*p. It's horrible, i highly suggest checking out the 1st episode, just to see how bad it is, it's actually interesting how messed up the ratio of actual quality/rating got; who the h*ll 9s this? Like who the f*ck would openly give this a 9 over 10? With a clear conscience, it's crazy. Either way, really bad show, very overrated, it's like watching a t*rd slide out of a r*ctum in slow motion. 3/10",2017
1,"I watched only the first 3 episodes, but it was enough to see where this ""pile of chocolate"" is going. The story is about a girl who wants to blame her decision on others, even tho she was mot murdered by tasteless jokes but killed herself. The TV show is about a total bitch who thinks that the world revolves around her, and that people are watching and thinking stuff about her every second of their life. And she can't stop being a total bitch even after she's dead so she sends tapes blaming everybody that she ever known. So next time when somebody asks you: ""Is this t-shirt looking good on me?"" Well you are f****d, because if you say ""no"" that motherf****r is going to hang himself in the closet, but if you say ""yes"" somebody may see him and make fun of him, in this case he's going to slid his veins. So in that moment you know that your friend is going to kill himself because of you. If you are a snowflake, this TV series is recommended for you by all means. ",2017
2,"SPOILER ALERT you see a classmate get rapped. days later you get into a hot tube with the same guy. in your underwear, at a party. then you get rapped and kill yourself. then blame everyone else. brilliant. the angst on Clay's face throughout the series grows annoying by the episode. 13 hrs of trying to get a message fails. at least it wasn't 127 hours.",2017
1,"Right off the bat, the thing that stood out to me with this show was the poor acting. They say that poor actors tend to over act, and thats exactly what you get from this show.",2017

8,"Ed Wood was Stanley Kubrick compared to Tommy Wiseau but James Franco treats him with such loving care that we can connect with his humanity without letting his eccentricities pull us away from him. That, I think, was the most moving aspect of this outrageous true life tale. James Franco is spectacular keeping it true and real in a character that lent itself for caricature. Dave Franco, James's brother in real life is the most believable instant soulmate of the James Dean wannabe. Seth Rogen is also perfect as the one knows that they're in for a major disaster and yet sees the whole thing to the bitter end. I must confess I hadn't heard of The Room but now it's on top of my list of films I want to see next.",2017
7,"""The Disaster Artist"" (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the real-life story of how the 2003 cult movie ""The Room"" got made. As the movie opens, a number of current day movie stars, including Kirsten Bell, Adam Scott. J.J. Abrams and others gush about the virtues of this ""so bad, that it's so good"" movie. We then shift to ""San Francisco, July 13, 1998"" when Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero meet at an acting class and strike up a friendship. Later that year, they decide on w him to move to Los Angeles, where Tommy somehow has kept an apartment. Tommy and Greg pursue their dream of becoming an actor (inspired by James Dean, among others), but when it's becoming clear that nobody wants to do anything with them, they decide to make their own film... At this point, we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
8,"Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau met at a San Francisco acting class in 1998. A young, nervous model, Greg was amazed by the bombastic, crazed performances of Tommy. Greg agreed to be his scene partner and had soon moved to Tommy's LA apartment on a peppercorn rent.",2017
8,"""The Disaster Artist"" is a true story based on the making of the notoriously bad cult film ""The Room,"" directed by Tommy Wiseasu. Wiseau is played by James Franco and Wiseau's friend Greg Sestero is played by Dave Franco. This was interesting, because I had heard so much about ""the Room"" and its cult status as one of the worst movies ever made. The trailer for the Disaster Artist was really intriguing, and I walked out pretty pleased.",2017
8,"The Room is one of those movies that is like a right of passage. If you're a fan of campy movies or you want to call yourself a movie lover, you have to watch it. I watched it just to prepare for The Disaster Artist. I thought there's no way its as bad as people say. Ya... it really is. I didn't fall in love with it as Franco and his friends obviously have but I wasn't angry while I was watching it. There are some moments where you can't help but laugh (I did naaaat! Oh hi Mark) and there were many times where I couldn't help but cover my face because of how awkward it gets (any part where anyone imitates a chicken). But it is the definition of awful film making. I just felt sorry for everyone involved, they obviously threw everything they had into it, they just didn't have the required talent to pull it off. Having seen The Disaster Artist, those suspicions are now confirmed.",2017
8,"Having been lucky enough to get tickets to the Australian premiere of The Disaster Artist with Greg Sestero himself in attendance, I was excited and eager to watch this amazing story. A comprehensive look at the making of what might be the most perplexing piece of cinema ever. I was not disappointed. James Franco is so spot on in his portrayal of Tommy's quirks and character its actually surreal. His first scene having him enter an acting class with the confidence of a rockstar but the talent of a fingerless piano player. Almost all of his endearingly strange lines had the audience laughing their heads off. I tip my hat to him and hopefully the Oscars come calling. He deserves to be nominated. ",2017
8,"So yeah, The Room is pretty well-known by now, becoming just about the most popular 'so bad it's good' film of all time over the last six or seven years, as has the story behind it- as detailed in Greg Sestero's book, The Disaster Artist.",2017
10,"The Disaster Artist is absolutely incredible. I don't want to go into detail because honestly this is one of those movies that is best seen relatively blind. What I will say is that the performances are great, the chemistry between Tommy and Greg is pitch perfect, and Seth Rogen and the rest of the supporting cast do an excellent job. The tone of the film is absolutely spot on. The last scene of this movie, and what comes after the end card, absolutely blew me away; this film is so much fun. I just saw this movie, and I already want to see it again. I rarely say this, but I can't think of literally anything this movie could've done differently that would've made it better. Everything it set out to do is done incredibly well. I highly, highly recommend this film. 10/10",2017
6,"There was an odd buzz surrounding this film, that in my opinion was totally unmerited. It just scratches the surface of the story and embellishes some things. I'm someone who is not a fan of The Room because, well it's really bad. That being said I really wanted to see what Franco had to offer here as far as unpacking what the hell caused the debacle of a film. Really Disaster Artist was an empty look and borders on biography and parody. I found the end to be very very overdone and from what I know, entirely fabricated.",2017

8,"I was really lucky to be able to see the preview screening of The Disaster Artist at the Hayden Orpheum in Sydney last weekend. I don't think I had ever been this excited to see a film, ever.",2017
6,"I thought for sure ""The Disaster Artist"" would be a slam-dunk based on advance buzz and reviews, and eagerly got out and saw it when it went wide and opened in my hometown this weekend. I enjoyed the heck out of roughly the first third of the film, but then, when it got around to the lengthy section depicting the making of ""The Room,"" the ""best worst film ever made,"" and the supposed mayhem of the actual real-life production crew and cast, I thought it fell flat and became a cartoon riff on what likely actually did happen on the real-life set. For some reason, Seth Rogen, who I normally get a big kick out of (though sometimes his trademark snark wears out its welcome) irritated me, as did other actors laying it on thick with the script's ""wink-wink-nudge-nudge"" too-obvious reaction to the mystery of Tommy Wiseau and his approach to life and filmmaking: I'm sure in real life crew and cast members' reactions to actually working on the ""The Room"" had a lot more complicated depth to them-- especially since they were being paid well and their checks were clearing at the bank as the production proceeded. Instead, we get this obvious, wafer-thin, surface and stereotypical reaction to Wiseau, with well-known actors doing small parts and winking at the camera as if to say ""isn't this funny""--which works for some films but just doesn't work here. Thankfully, the ending section of the film, depicting the premiere of ""The Room"" and all that's happened since, almost saves it, but it had flagged too much by then for me to feel I got my money's (or time's) worth. I like the Franco brothers, am truly a fan of their wide variety of mainstream and independent film efforts overall (I'm one of the few who actually liked ""Why Him?"" and ""This is The End,"" two polarizing comedies that either brought belly laughs or annoyed the heck out people) but ""The Disaster Artist"" is not either of their best efforts. It's clearly meant as a star-studded-cameo playtime lark, but a lark that those same actors likely enjoyed more than we do as an audience--and in my opinion it doesn't serve the real-life people it depicts very well, either, except to make viewers curious about the real ""The Room"" film, and about the people involved in that production. I was surprised that in the end the Francos and all involved in ""The Disaster Artist"" seemed to be laughing at--and not affectionately with--the real Tommy Wiseau and actors/crew of ""The Room.""",2017
8,"Among hobbies that come and go when it comes to movies, the internet film critic persona really exploded in the early 2000s after the show Siskel & Ebert initially started the trend decades before. But with that, many sensations most notably The Nostalgia Critic played by Doug Walker gained a lot of attention after covering what was supposedly the worst movie ever made. Yet as much as they bashed it, everyone still recommended seeing it and that was because of the man behind the whole production. That man, Tommy Wiseau has now gone from complete movie reject to film celebrity because of The Room (2003) he had released so many years ago. Although there are several things known about Wiseau, there are still many basic facts nobody knows about him like his ethnic background and how old he is. Nevertheless, with his movie now having a collective fan base, there was bound to be a movie made about it whether it be a biopic or documentary. Really the biopic was the only option left because the documentary was already done.",2017
1,If you have not seen The Room... you might not like this mockumentary. The film is entertaining in a painful way and deserves maybe a 4 or 5 max just for the sake that they mock the original pretty good. Otherwise it is pretty pathetic to the point that you just feel sorry for the main characters. Tommy surely is a very unique person yet someone that hollywood hates to see around town. The creep that brings the pursuit of fame for no reason except the pursuit and totally devoid of any talent. ,2017
6,"Oh hi Mark, I was hyped to see this movie ever since I saw the trailers. The Disaster Artist is a biography of what it was like making The Room; which seemed to start out as a good concept in the pre-production stages, but once it got to the troubled production - the movie goes to show that life can be hard and that accomplishing your dream is far from easy. The cast was noble especially the Franco brothers as Tommy and Greg, and overall, I thought the film delivered a virtuous significance. Now that I think of it, this is probably just as good or even better than The ""actual"" Room! Don't you agree?",2017
1,"""The Disaster Artist"" is a story about the making of a 2003 movie called ""The Room"" which was written, produced, funded and starred Tommy Wiseau for an estimated $6 million. It's opening weekend take was $1,800. ""The Room"" became a cult classic and over time has earned more that the initial cost despite dreadful ratings. For some reason ""The Disaster Artist"" is being rated very highly. Half of the audience at the matinee I attended walked out before thirty minutes. I stayed because it just had to get better. I was wrong.",2017
4,"The movie is not as fun as just watching the movie The Room. It does have some interesting moments, such as showing how James Dean famously yelled, ""You're tearing me apart!"" and now that factored into the backstory behind the film. It shows how Tommy had a strange amount of money and made a really bad movie with it.",2017
1,"I've never seen or heard of ""The Room"" and based on this, I won't bother. It's a horrible movie about the making of an apparently horrible movie. There are a few mildly entertaining scenes but most of it is a mumbling mess that left me with a headache. I don't know what James Franco was going for but what he ended up with is a barely understandable character and trite dialogue. Please don't waste your time with this. If you are a fan of ""The Room"" for some reason, you will probably enjoy it. Outside of that, better to stay home and watch reruns than waste time and money on this crap.",2017
1,"Unless you really like ""The Room"" I don't see how anyone could rate this movie well given that it expects you to have seen it.",2017
6,"The Disaster Artist is essentially a biopic of an episode in the life of the mysterious Tommy Wiseau, a failed actor who somehow managed to spend over $6m on making what some regard as the worst film in Hollywood history; The Room. (It scores 3.6 on IMDB for information.)",2017
6,"""The Disaster Artist"" is the highly anticipated bio pic about Tommy Wiseau's infamous masterpiece ""The Room"", which has gained a cult status for it being ""so bad its good."" While I fairly enjoyed the film and had a chuckle that this was even made, I can still understand the problems. There is nothing special about anything on a technical area, the cinematography and directing can range from blah to just plain ugly. The acting is fairly forgettable from everyone except the real reason this film works so well which is James Franco's performance as Tommy Wiseau, in case anyone is worried he did a fantastic job. But like I said everyone and everything else is so forgettable it tends to annoy me on reflection. ",2017
9,"Tommy Wiseau's move The Room holds a special spot in my heart. Not because it was a cinematic masterpiece, but instead i was able to find entertainment in a constant mess of a movie. Over the years, I've learned a lot of quotes from the movie, all the hidden details and as many behind the scenes info as possible. I was filled with excitement for seeing The Disaster Artist come to life as a The Room fan but even the curiosity of a solid comedy.",2017
3,"I'm not sure if it's because I have a bias having already listened to the audio book (audio book is recommended because Greg Sestero does a perfect Tommy Wisseau impersonation, which really adds to the story), but I really wanted to like this movie and pretty much wrote it off as liking it even before I watched it. I was already a fan of The Room and the Disaster Artist book and had seen several interviews in reference to the movie, so liking this seemed inevitable, but it was horrible. That's what I theorize happened. People wanted to like this movie and it has such an interesting back story that they tricked themselves into thinking they liked it? Much like the room it didn't feel like a real movie. It's hard to imagine that this was a normal budgeted movie with normal actors and a normal director, because every aspect of the movie felt B rate. The only part that didn't was when they were reenacting scenes from The Room. I was in a full theater and this movie attracted minimal laughs. It got a handful of chuckles, mostly forced chuckles, but no real laughter. ",2018
5,"This movie had a lot of potential. It started out great, but it began to fall apart rapidly just after the halfway mark. ",2017
4,"Spoilers: I felt like Ansel Elgort was miscast in the movie. I've seen a number of his roles and I don't think I liked any of the characters he portrayed. Whenever he's on screen, I can't help but think of Big Baby from ""Toy Story 3"", which ruins moments completely. I'm not sure if it's his acting or the way the role was written, but his character comes across as obnoxious, to the point where I was rooting against him. ",2017

2,"Just saw this in cinema. It seems to have been written with a teenage audience in mind that doesn't ask any questions, or has demands like story or character development or narrative flow and just buys the movie as is. IMDb rating of 8.6 at the time of writing this here... how...?",2017
5,The only thing I can say for sure about Baby Driver is that this movie is highly overrated. It certainly doesn't deserve such a high rating as it does now on here. It's an easy to watch action movie but not the best one in this genre. The plot isn't difficult to understand and it isn't that bad either but the characters are what brings this movie down. Too much have-you-see-me characters just don't do any good to the movie. I really doubt criminals and bank robbers would act like they do before a heist. It would be for sure a disaster every time. Kevin Spacey is the big name in Baby Driver but don't watch this movie to see him in action. He did much better movies than this one. The rest of the cast can clearly act but it's just their ridiculous characters that makes this just an average action movie.,2017

Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.",2017

It had the potential to be a decent action movie but I was suspicious from the moment I saw it had 8.3 on here. I mean, what could have they done with this movie to deserve such a high rating? So, just in case, I lowered my expectations and, somehow, I still managed to be disappointed. Is it possible I am not seeing the originality and perfection of this movie that everyone keeps talking about?",2017
1,"I can't believe this movie has an 8.1 IMDb rating at the time of my review! The characters are weak and the plot is nonexistent. This isn't a movie - it's a collections of scenes that do not quite mesh together to make it even remotely interesting. Despite all the action scenes, I was quickly bored. And it never got better - there was no plot twist, no interesting character development, nothing! Save your money and go be bored somewhere else, for free!",2017
1,"Someone else also used this summary and gave a glowing positive review so it just goes to show that two people can see the same movie and experience completely different emotions. Having read several pages of IMDb reviews I can see that I am in a massive minority of those who have posted .But as with everything in life.. that doesn't make the majority right and the minority wrong ....I mean look at Trump ...oh sorry he lost the popular vote as well so even the ""majority "" was wrong ... Anyway this movie is complete drivel and one of the worst of the last decade . I deeply resent the waste of expenditure on two movie tickets and the two hours torn from my life . The script must have been less than 4 pages of A4 if the directions were left out as there was almost no communication worthy of the name and no subtlety in character development whatsoever . The ""plot"" is ludicrous so that would be OK if it was supposed to be a farce or a fantasy but I fear it was intended to be neither of those two genres . And of course I should have anticipated that to be the case in view of the Director's puerile previous work .I somehow thought he might have grown up . Towards the end a car containing one of the villains Buddy , John Hamm ,who has already been shot, is pushed through a barrier in a multistorey car park and falls at least 4 stories to the ground outside landing on its roof .Less than a minute later Buddy ..completely uninjured by this catastrophic incident ..has emerged from the car and somehow regained the fourth floor to attack the sort of hero ""Baby"" . So I suppose I am the idiot for believing that excitement ,thrills ,tension needs some element of credibility. With literally dozens slaughtered by gunshot and farcical car stunt chases ...yawn yawn ..oh surely the movie goer cannot get a thrill from such action...?..seen it all before a hundred times ..boring boring . The only remaining content of the movie was the music : good but anyone can phone up to license the use of the creativity and skill of real artists so it doesn't exactly count as some sort of creative worth and a nice performance from Ansel Elgort as Baby. Every other major actor played an ""I am only doing this for the money"" wooden caricature .If you are assessing this movie before going please don't waste your money and time .",2017
10,"Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.",2017

For the life of me, I cannot understand how it's getting any praise at all, let alone heaps of it. The premise/plot is colossally stupid, so it's check-your-brain-at-the-door stuff from the get-go. But even within those cartoonish parameters, there is not one interesting story element nor compelling character to be found. The movie is cliché after cliché. It has this one parlor trick, which surely you've heard about, where it often syncopates the (ridiculous) action with the music track. To which I reply, okay, fine. In no way do I see how this somehow elevates the terrible script and two-dimensional characters. At no point did I care about what happened to anyone. I hate to overuse simple descriptors like ""dumb"" or ""pointless,"" but honestly, I can't use them enough about this movie.

And before that, there was something called ""dance"", but that's not the subject here. Of course, some could argue that it's a non-musical film with synchronised action to music... Once again, it's been done before, like the Diva's on-stage performance matching Leeloo's fight in a hotel room in ""The Fifth Element"", or the EVE and WALL-E open-space maneuvers in Pixar's ""WALL-E""...",2017

1,"Enduring this movie was a pain - i mean literal physical pain.   Predictable plot would be an understatement if there were any.  Character motivations are non-existent. It's just a random mess of  pointless violence in the universe where every police officer has an IQ  of a carrot. The main protagonist is mix of typical ""my mommy died"" and  ""save the girl"" motivations.   Please - do everyone a favor. Don't watch this movie. Let Hollywood  starve themselves to death. Maybe then they will move on from cookie  cutter plots and characters.   It's awful. But it will probably sit fine with 14-22 year old  ""Twilight"" fans.",2017
1,"I think this film only made it to cinemas cause it has managed to involve household names such as Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (why these great actors ever said yes to this project heaven knows). It is a thoroughly empty and soul-less attempt to be a stylish new thing, but falls to the ground with a thud. Nikolas Winding Refn's film Drive has already done everything that Baby Driver tries to do. Where Drive succeeded in telling a mysterious, deep story involving romance and action at the same time as having a unique auteur style, Baby Driver falls short in every respect. There is nothing wrong with the cast as such, Im sure the actors do their very best with a thin plot and an even thinner dialogue. Why this film has received such high rating on IMDb is a mystery to me.",2017
2,"I'll be honest – I f**king hated 'Mother!', and by that I mean I absolutely loathed it. If you thought 'Black Swan' was pretentious, well you haven't yet seen writer-director Darren Aronofsky's latest self-aggrandizing piece of 'artistic filmmaking'.",2017
5,"I was in the right mood for a smart horror film, they used to be my favorite kind of film until they sort of disappeared, the smart part not the horror. I'm a huge fan of Polanski's The Tenant - it terrified me more than any other film, followed shortly by 2 other Roman Polanski masterpieces, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. There are others - Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Martin Donovan's Apartment Zero, Alex De La Iglesias's La Comunidad, Davin Lynch's Eraserhead and Blue Velvet in particular. Most of Luis Bunuel's work and a few others. Mother! reminded me somehow of some of them but it was just like a tease that didn't really matured into anything.Here everything is outrageously on the nose but not in a phenomenal Ken Russell way but in a rather obvious, unconvincing, ""look at me"" kind of thing. I love Jennifer Lawrence but in Mother! she wakes up at the beginning of the film and she's already panicky. Please, don't misunderstand me, I'm not suggesting a prequel! No, clearly Darren Aronfski gave the audience too much credit or not enough because for me, as a member of the audience, left me cold. I may have winced at the sight of blood but it didn't frighten me. The ""wound"" on the floor? Remember the hole in the wall of ""The Tenant""? Maybe it's my fault. I've seen too many films and young audiences haven't. I've read some of the positive comments and I imagine they are from very young people who feel, quite rightly, they been given something besides Marvel and they have. I only hope they use it as a gateway to discover some of the ""old"" films. And as for Mother! what I enjoyed was the totally unexpected turn by Michelle Pfeiffer. Dark and funny, mocking or better still, paying tribute to Ruth Gordon - I imagine. I left the theater with a desperate need to revisit Rosemary's Baby and you know what? I will. So after all said and done, thank you.",2017

4,"Darren Aronfsky is a director I follow, even since Pi. He's daring and unpredictable. I loved Requiem For A Dream and Black Swan, the rest of his opus has left me puzzled or downright annoyed. Mother! belongs to the later. All the element's were there - Rosemary's Baby written by Edward Albee - that's what I thought right up to Michelle Pfeiffer's entrance, then something happened - The movie falls through a totally unbelievable, hysterical downward spiral. What? Yes, exactly. Jennifer Lawrence suffers, puffs and moans from the very first frame, well second frame. She's afraid from the word go. She could run away but for some reason she never ventures out of the house. Questions like that become a massive obstacle for us to care and feel connected - Think of Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby or Colin Firth in Apartment Zero - co-habitating with a devil, surrounded by sinister neighbors or unwanted visitors. Those films also had sensational scripts and the narrative even when symbolic was always solidly based on the story at hand - Here it feels like gimmicks - One idea and then round and round the mulberry bush. I don't know how many times she shouts at her husband ""Please make them leave"" - Jennifer Lawrence goes through it valiantly and vociferously. Javier Bardem as the egomaniacal husband is absurdly unconvincing - and I'm a devoted a fan - Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who brings something new to the proceedings and a truly startling performance. Other than that, I'm sorry to say no to Mother!",2017

2,"As I say in the title of my review, it is neither artful nor profound to jam every possible reference and metaphor into your movie. It's lazy. It means you have no clear direction and/or are trying to appear meaningful while being unable to resist inserting your own 'struggle' into the 'high concept'... as though you are equating yourself with the existential conflicts of gods and nature... I should think this is the penultimate epitome of pretentiousness and narcissism.",2017

2,"Maybe the intention was to make a terrifying comedy about, about, about...well, I'm not sure. A Mother! like that with an exclamation mark? An artist with an ego bigger than their house? Who knows. I certainly tried to cling on to something but I couldn't. It seems like a terrible confession to make but the truth is I couldn't care less about that mother because I didn't believe in her plight and couldn't understand her behavior. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress we all know that but here, she screams and screams while I glanced at my watch with mounting impatience. Borrowing from other, better films, doesn't help, on the contrary, it irritates. Rosemary's Baby came to mind as well as The Tenant, Apartment Zero, Common Wealth. All films that terrified me without explicit gore and superb screenplays. Mother! seems like an interesting idea totally derailed by an out of control ego.",2017
10,"This movie took my breath away. When the end credits began to roll, all  I could think of was just how brilliant this film is! I was  absolutely astonished by the level of craftsmanship on Darren  Aronofsky's part, and just the sheer complexity of the writing.  Aronofsky says he wrote the screenplay in six days, which just blows my  mind. It is so intricate and delicately designed, that I don't know how  he was able to write it in less than a week. I think it just goes to  show how much of a pure genius Aronofsky is. This is a movie that is  driven 100% by its story and its screenplay. Everything else, from the  camera angles, to the score, to the performances, are in service to  that script. So it's hard to sit here and say ""Oh, well the  cinematography is gorgeous"" or ""Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in the  film"", because their purpose was not to stand out on their own.  Everything they did was to enrich and drive forward this story, and  that doesn't necessarily work for every film, but it absolutely works  here. This film is made by the deep complexity of its metaphors and  allegories, and by its social and theological analysis of our past,  present, and future. Without the strength of its script, mother! would  fall apart. Luckily, Aronofsky has crafted a masterful screenplay that  works and plays on so many different levels...",2017
9,"These days, we live in a world where most things are terrible and don't make any sense. Yet, a film like Mother! can still come along and disgust audiences. A film so off-putting, Rex Reed declared it ""The worst film of the century"". Make no mistake, Mother! is a profoundly polarizing film. But that is only because it went mainstream. It stars mainstream actors. It's distributed by Paramount. In recent years, the art-house and the multiplex have never crossed paths. But as the era of the blockbuster fades away, it was only a matter of time for Hollywood to return back to it's roots. To bring us back to the late 1960's, where most films meant something. Films that grab you. Films that push serious boundaries. I rarely leave a theater shaken. But Mother! did just that. It is a beautiful, terrifying assault on your senses.",2017
5,"I have a nagging feeling that the raves come from people in their 20's and/or younger. I maybe wrong but the debate erupting from this movie reeks of youth. Something similar happened with Terrence Malnick's The Tree Of Life. People either loved it or hated it. From my own personal POV the only different between The Tree Of Life and Mother! is that The Tree Of Life was a masterpiece without any visual cope outs and, perhaps, the only commercial concession were in big star names but even then Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career. Mother ! Is not a masterpiece, not to me anyway. I couldn't connect. Was it a comedy of the absurd? When I saw all the people dancing and partying in the house I had a flash back to Blake Edwards's ""The Party""Jennifer Lawrence is a truly gifted actress and beautiful to boot and, quite clearly, she put herself in Darren Aronfski's hands, She, the mother, calls out ""Baby""? Hoping to find her husband - She is a Saint Joan half burned already. That truly puzzled me. Can you please give us time to connect with her? A few minutes. If you remember Mia Farrow's Rosemary - She was, emotionally, so far away from what she's about to confront. Polanski takes the audience through her journey and we're with her, every step of the way. What makes it so terrifying is the veil of normalcy that surrounds the proceedings. In Mother, the surreal takes over the atmosphere and destroys it. We can keep a distance without really participating. The same can be said of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer - They are a welcome, semi-camp addition at the perfect time and then, they disappear. The glory of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer in Rosemary's Baby is that their intrusion is taken all the way through to extraordinary results. And Javier Bardem/John Cassavetes? If you're interested watch Rosemary's Baby again like I did last night, 24 hours after seeing Mother!and then you tell me. In my modest opinion one is a flawless masterpiece the other is just okay.",2017

To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say.",2017

2,"Where do I even begin? Oh my... this script could have easily been written by a 10-year-old, practically every move and line of dialogue were predictable, clichéd, and downright cringy most of the time. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this 'movie' gets any form of praise for the 'acting' that took place in this movie. The aforementioned acting was weak, not only did the story lack substance, but practically every interaction is inevitably guided towards infantile, unintelligent humor. The CGI/Animation were not up to the standard that we are accustomed to from Marvel, it was just flashy and all over the place. I usually try not to write any negative reviews, but this was just too much to handle. I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was in awe as to how awful this movie was. Marvel movies have silly humor here and there but a good portion of the jokes are well placed in their movies, they can even be intelligent and memorable; but this... whatever this was... horrendous writing. If you are like me, and want to be up-to-date with what's happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's why you chose to watch this movie, you didn't miss out on anything.",2017

I think it's a goofy movie for kids, a bit different from the first one. The ""funny"" scenes have been dramatized too much, so much that they became stupid jokes. The movie itself is too long, no funny movie should ever be so long. You cannot keep people laughing for more than 2 hours...even if the movie was a REALLY funny movie (which it was not). I was expecting coming out this Vol. 2 for so long...I guess I created too many expectations for it. Go to watch the movie thinking that would be ""just OK"", my 2 cents.",2017

Although I would hardly have believed it possible, I enjoyed Vol. 2 a bit more even than the first Guardians movie.",2017

I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.",2017
8,"I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.",2017

The cast stays in complete character only improving by letting the audience get to know and love them. Even Drax's absurd laugh was necessary. They did not drag you through the beef between sisters, x gang affiliates or father and son. They only produced an appropriate outcome for each situation that leaves the studio wide open for Vol. 3. The soundtrack is really its own character making even the most rhythmically challenged viewers feeling comfortable bobbing their heads. I don't watch trailers so hearing a familiar voice in a film that already had it all was the bonus track with features artist.",2017

For the USA network: ratings would probably be so much higher but all At&t customers can't record shows ahead of time anymore. At&t now only allows us to setup recording of a show a few hours before the show however most people WORK and have children and busy lives therefor aren't in front of the TV a few hours ahead of any showtime whereas before we could look ahead many hours even days/weeks to schedule upcoming shows we wanted! We tried using At&t's search option and it didn't come up that way either and it's not on demand, therefor it's impossible for most people to record this show!! We had to watch it on our black box/android box.

Some will say "" oh boy here we go"" dude it's only a movie. Really? And I will reply "" Do you actually know how to read and do research?"" Same crap every decade or so. No one really has a problem with people making great money or even a small fortune, that's never been the argument, it's the way some of these rich people/Bankers go about it behind the scenes and the lives that get destroyed while they do it.

3,"""The raid that supposedly led to Bin Laden's death has been shrouded in mystery for years. Speculation that the Obama administration may have embellished or outright lied about the true account of what happened has persisted, mainly because the White House has refused to publicly release images of Bin Laden's body.
Although the White House said the corpse was immediately ""buried at sea"" in line with Islamic tradition, it quickly emerged that this was not standard practice.
Numerous analysts have claimed that Bin Laden had in fact been dead for years and that the raid on his alleged compound in Pakistan was little more than a stunt.
Other questions also persist, such as why the narrative and timeline of the raid has changed multiple times, why the White House initially claimed that ""situation room"" photos showed Obama watching the raid live when in fact there was a blackout on the live feed, and why neighbors in the immediate area surrounding the compound said with absolute certainty that they had never seen Bin Laden and that they knew of no evidence whatsoever to suggest he lived there.""",2018

Perhaps more action then is really on camera? Why do they feel the need to do this? Makes watching very frustrating.,2017
5,"THE BRAVE (NBC), SEAL TEAM (CBS): I group these together because it's the same show - different casts but the same predictable plot lines, same characters - each with some kind of specialty, same trite dialogue ('You can run, but you can't hide.' They actually paid someone to write that?), same mediocre acting, same over-edited action sequences, and same female commander just like every other procedural show on TV with the possible exception of NCIS. (Before you get all bent out of shape over this, I get it. I understand the necessity for equality, but com' on! Really? I think we've reached the saturation point.) Their job is to stand in front of a slew of monitors, supposedly watching events in real time so they can spot problems and advise their teams on counter measures, all the while emoting expressions of concern during and relief after the operation is completed so they can deliver the 'Well done team. Return to base.' line, while the other members of the team in the situation room clap and congratulate each other on another successful mission. The pity is, there are some good people wasted in these: Anne Heche and Mike Vogel in The Brave, and David Boreanaz stars in Seal Team. The deserve better material than this and so do we. Neither is worth your time. Score: The Brave: 6, Seal Team: 5. I'd be very surprised it either lasts a full season.",2017
2,"The show just starts off terrible, and what got me even more angry is CBS dropped the show The Unit and years later, just basically rips them off with this show, even to the point where the seals cover story is logistics!! Only difference is seals then elite special ops of army. Drop this show Bring back the unit Heck Michael Irby is in it already, get the rest of the crew.",2017
3,"Bickering and arguing is rampant from S1E6. I really don't like it because of that. Like all Hollywood shows, there are 90 pound supermodels playing grunts and (outside) the enemy fires off 5000 rounds and can't hit anyone. I have to slow the show to 87% speed to understand what they are saying.",2017
5,"It's an OK show, but I have only so much time to watch TV, and this one doesn't make the cut. I was rooting for it, because I liked Boreanaz in Bones, but there just isn't much there. Another reviewer mentioned The Unit, and he's right -- THAT was a truly great show, and seems to be one of the models for this one, but the writing is not nearly sharp enough, and the characters and stories are too predictable. And, as others have noted, the dialogue is annoyingly hard to understand. My hearing isn't what it used to be, and I thought it might just be me, so I guess I'm relieved to hear that others are having the same problem. But turning on the subtitles only revealed that I shouldn't have bothered. I also agree that Jessica Paré seems miscast. I'm sticking with The Brave for now, but judgment is still out on that one.",2017
3,If you missed Seeley Booth then this is the show for you. More like a soap opera rather then an action/drama.,2018
1,"Another boring fairy tale of good soldiers sacrificing their lives for the freedom of innocents ones? Oh, no. So cliché and so fake. How come producers have found reliable and profitable this project, I'll never know. With all the appealing subjects you can explore in a TV series, they chose this rhetoric pile of crap. Again. Next.",2017
2,"One of the characteristics of bad TV programming is unintelligible dialog. This is also a prominent differentiating factor for TV programming vs. theatrical movies. If a movie released in theaters has this particular problem, where the audience can't understand what the characters are saying, people get up and walk out of the theater. The movie will usually be gone from the theaters by the following Friday. But with TV programming there are a bunch of producers and directors who are amateurs by comparison, who clearly do not understand this, even though it is inexplicable that they wouldn't. But they don't. Half of the characters in this program mumble their lines. I can't understand half of what they are saying, and I refuse to turn on closed captioning to watch this dumb TV show. Why did they bother to make this, if they weren't going to make a sincere effort to make it watchable?",2017
8,I feel like I have to review this show just to counter act all the bogus reviews that have issues with the female characters. The reviews seems to think a show about navy seals should only have men it it. ,2017
6,"Not bad honestly, but it does have elements seen before and done better. The traumatised man in charge who has balance his normal life with his career, the smart-ass rookie, the high-octane action etc. Nevertheless, it's a decent watch. Boreanaz is looking good and it's nice to see him on telly again fresh out of Bones. As for the people complaining about PC with the women, well it was clearly stated that they were part of the support personnel so yeah...",2017
3,"No spoilers here..i think the show is called Seal Team for a reason. its like C.Minds beyond boarders..but the one thing i don't get why not stick to what its called. SEALTEAM..they are millions an millions of family's with Problems.i don't want to see that. i want action of what they DO.an what they do best. save us from the bad people. they harp too long on the sentimental stuff. that's boring to me.the other show ""The Brave is very good.",2017
4,"""SEAL Teams"" a story about Seal team 6? hell yeah I am up for that! ",2017
10,"okay, this is mainly addressing the two bad reviews of this show so far, about the big mouthed female seal member. well number one, that character, played by Jessica Pare, was not a seal member, her character was CIA. if you paid attention you'd know that. it is true that their are no female seal members. But also, the character played by Toni Trucks, it is never implied that she is active seal, or even a seal team member. her character could by back up marines or army. this show, after only one episode was really good. i hope it continues. and by the way, if you notice while watching, the character played by Toni Trucks, is never on the ground with the seal team at all, not during the stakeout in the city, watching for their target, or when the actually raid the building.",2017
8,(Spoiler) Just to be safe. ,2017
2,"All things considered...this show is so full of crap. Technically, it is a load of sheep dip. So many problems with military side of the show it is difficult to name them all. For one, No one would HALO jump with exposed skin, But, there he is, hardcore hero, jumping in temps of -40 degrees with sleeves rolled up. Acting is okay, but if you are looking for something that is close to reality, look elsewhere. Just another show for the Axe generation.",2018
6,"Very similar concept to the excellent show the Unit with Dennis Haysbert 8.1 on IMDb. The dichotomy between the mission and the home life. In the unit there seemed to be a better balance between showing the lives of the wives, as they had their own story lines. So far in this show the wives seem like window dressing. ",2017
7,"I see a lot of people giving this show such a bad rap I almost didn't watch it but after getting bored, I watched the first three episodes tonight and it's a lot better than most of the crap out there. Forget the show is called Taken because it has nothing to do with Liam or the movies. Should be called Shadow Team 5 or what ever and yes, it's been done 50 dozen times. Secret ops group within the US government is to take down all the bad guys. I am over 50 and track a LOT of TV shows and most don't make past 30 minutes with me these days but this one has potential but is also very comparable to Lethal Weapon or Shooter or Homeland or Blacklist or any other secret FBI CIA secret ops type shows. So if you liked those, then you will probably like this.",2017
4,"I really wanted to like this, because I love Clive Standen. But it is just another FBI, Homeland Security, CIA or whatever show, we have seen a thousand times. Hard but somehow sentimental Superhero forced to work with a tough Special Troop. And of course he becomes the best man. He and the Professionals behave extremely stupid when the plot needs a twist. And we have the tough Boss woman, the female nerd and the black and Latino sidekicks. It really gets boring.",2017
5,"This show has action but the same thing all the other action shows have these days. Mills gets his a$$ handed to him every episode, a car chase, a foot race, some fire and lots of crying. Same old antagonists with pointless actions making ridiculous decisions. Old school entertainment. Writers from the same school, same professors that educated their teachers decades ago, with the same idea of what makes a good action story. ",2017
4,"Yes we all know Hollywood has no originality and this tiresome telly spin off, of the Taken film franchise, proves this, yet again. ",2017
3,"Having loved the movie by this name, I was really hoping the TV show would be as exciting. Quite frankly, I have no idea why they called it 'Taken' because it has nothing to do with the movie, unless we're to really believe this is its prequel.",2017
1,"Predictable stale plots, bad action sequences and obligatory B-movie CIA clichés. Cast and acting are OK, but stuck on trying to make something generic and implausible feel authentic and real. Have had high hopes for this series considering that it has Luc Besson and Alexander Cary listed as creators. Done with this series after episode 4.",2017
1,The pilot had promise...,2017
1,"They keep making these movies into films and all but lethal weapon IMO is the same. Apart from that these FBI action/thrillers are the same. This fits the mold of Blindspot to a tee. BS Kung po fighting (Sorry I am a martial artist)... (A real one). The ""recruitment"", always so formulaic which is weird as that seems to be the part they really try to distinguish but you always see it coming a mile away. Later comes the ""We traced a cell to a local abadoned warehouse, I did it by triangulating his tevo, through the infraweb, then I cross wired the service breakers and rerouted the primary axiom to the internal mainframe""..... At least that what I get from all that blaahhhh! I actually thought for one moment that this might actually follow the first movies story but bulk it out. I mean, lets face it... 2 and 3 were blah... Hell 1 was but it had the ""I WILL find you"", and that's what got people. They knew this but instead of going with the winner (the first movie)they revamped it as the new Blindspot. Has that been cancelled yet? I'm guessing this is its replacement for those that like blah. Who is the Simon Cowell that keeps trying to polute minds with this manufatured mesh of unoriginal rehashed concepts? Is it really because the bulk of us enjoy this is it really just down to what they offer us?",2017
10,"I must say that after the first episode I was a little disappointed but upon further viewing, plenty of action fast moving just what the public want. If you enjoyed 24 with Jack Bauer then this is for you. The overall plot was very logical and once I got into it I couldn't stop watching, and the main thing I liked was a different task each episode. I give this a resounding 10/10 it kept me glued to the screen until the finale. I pray they decide to do a second series.",2017
1,So it started off great with lots of action.,2017
10,"Clive Standen's spirit strength as an actor is perfectly poured into in the character of Bryan Mills. His martial arts background serves Mills very well. As soon as I recognized he is the lead in ""Taken,"" I made a point of not missing the premier. I am thrilled the show is so good. A quiet and strong character that doesn't hang on the excess of flashy moves to woo the audience is ultra refreshing. I look forward to seeing this show last a long time. The casting is fantastic. The dialogue feels original and true. The sound is outstanding! And best of all, the action flows as honest as the narrative.",2017
1,"...after it was extremely clear that the writers didn't speak to the directors who didn't speak with the editors who didn't speak with the producers and then they hired non-actors to not act what was poorly written and directed in the first place? Wow. I wish they had donated whatever money they spent making this total incoherent crap to charity. Worst worst worst show I've ever tried to watch. Best stupid line in episode 1: ""do you know why you ere shot?"" And a short time later in the conversation, the person shot asks, ""You're recruiting me?"" Of course that's how we do it in the ridiculous universe. Are you kidding me?",2018
2,"another stupid show that starts out good, then immediately brings cops into it.. that's all TV has to offer now, nobody can write a good action show without some stupid office and support teams and a real B**** of a boss and the typical everything else that comes with pretty much every cop show on TV. His flashbacks are really what you're going with as an issue?? seriously? this guy was in the hardest branch of the military but he's so affected by his sisters death he can't function anymore.. ugh. this show will be canceled at the end of this season. nobody will care about the sister in a few episodes they will lose interest and that will be that.",2017
3,"I had high hopes but the show is not well written. There are so many holes in the plots you could drive a car through them. Here is this highly trained individual and he does the dumbest things such as leaving his phone unattended, sticks his head up during a gunfight but of course does not get shot, runs after a speeding car on foot, etc. ANd of course there are those in the alleged intelligence community who cannot even prounce words properly but they can tell what gun he is using by just listening to the main character pull the slide back. OMG, such nonsense. The show is written by morons for morons. I now know why NBC is the least watched network, they have the least intelligent writes and obviously executives who think people would actually buy into a stupid show like this. I fully expect it to be canceled.",2017
1,"Shoehorn characters from a popular franchise that centers around a highly skilled spy having his daughter kidnapped into a painfully generic counter-terrorism centered ""cop show"" and you have ""Taken"" the series.",2017

9,"I like this show... hell better than 24 legacy, better acting from all of the casts... I like the plots the twists.. hell I like it better than the Taken Movies... I hope they don't cancel the show... Better action than Walking Dead, and Game of Thrones!! which I always fall asleep when I watch those shows..",2017
10,Clive Standen has previously paid his dues over the past dozen or so years but in Taken he plays a former CIA agent and is now the featured star of his own action/suspense television series. Having just watched the pilot episode you know you are going to enjoy the series when the episode has ended and you just feel like it got started and you want more of the same.,2017
10,"I've not written many reviews on IMDb as I usually just discuss in forums (oh well). However, I really wanted to give a review of this show as a) I was surprised the rating was so low (6.8 as I write this) b) I really enjoyed the first two episodes.",2017
6,"Because of the title, I started watching this series, but so far it has not lived up to it's name. I really want to like this show and will give it another couple of episodes and hope that it gets better. So far the acting is only fair and the series appears to be not well written. Clive Standen is a better actor than this series, but a good actor can only do so much with a poorly written and produced show. Hopeful!",2017
6,"After 3 iterations of the film ""Taken"", I wondered if this prequel to the franchise was exhausted. I was pleasantly surprised, but not quite aroused.",2017
8,2017 is the year of pilots after well-known successful movie franchises. It is a classic revenge story about a loner military type character. ,2017
10,Loved this program one of the best I have watched really hope there is gonna be more. It keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end everyone is great in it. But Clive who plays Bryan mills is just amazing what a great actor. Just hope there is gonna be another series. If you like excitement then you must watch,2017
4,It is absolutely woeful. Like real actors performing a show made by children. ,2018
7,"Enjoyed the films, so was interested to see what the series was like, but a little concerned some of the reviews had been poor. But I Enjoyed the pilot, a few twists and turns, good action, and not bad acting at all. Of course it's all totally ludicrous, but never the less the first episode was entertaining and fun, and with plenty of action. ",2017
8,"I have just seen 2 episodes so far. I was afraid it would be a low-cost comics adaptation (not one X-men, blurry background about time and situation) but I must say I'm delighted.",2017
8,"I'm usually hesitant to watch new TV shows these days as they mostly disappoint me. I am very critical on quality of acting and the plot or the story itself. I'm hooked alright!. Although it is more like the X-men series, it's surprisingly captivating. It emphasized the importance of family and value of human lives. The acting is excellent; the plot is unpredictable. The CGI can be improved, but it's far better than standard TV shows. It's an action show but not too violent. It's a great show to watch for the entire family.",2017
10,For all fans out there loving the Heroes series The Gifted will be a great follow up in the realm of X.,2017
5,"After the first three episodes, it's clear the writers can't steer clear of toxic cliché and tired stereotypes. There's too much useless babbling -- ""where did you get this car, these eats are sticky"" is what the son is whining about when the family is desperately on the run. The mother is an adamant soccer mom who doesn't seem desperate at all: she's gonna get answers to her questions or nobody goes any further... oh darn, the police have arrived.",2017
9,"I'm hooked after seeing the first episode, it's a great installment in The X-Men Universe. I was wondering will sink like the first episode of Inhumans. But it didn't sink it sailed in my book, the effects are incredible, and the CGI is not over used.",2017
9,"Finally a good ""Marvel"" Universe TV show. Great cast, good SFX, great plot and suspense. Writers at FOX paid attention to the original X-men literature and to me, a longtime Marvel fan, that is important! Very happy to finally see the X-Universe coming back to life and really looking forward to the next episode. p.s. Natalie Alyn Lind ! wow",2017
7,This is very reminiscent of Heroes and the first episode hasn't shown something we haven't seen before.,2017
2,"The story is OK... same heroes type series. Unfortunately it is flooded with clichés, over acting and those corny lines we have heard a million times that makes a person cringe! Good program amateur actors that unfortunately make it barely watchable. Hopefully as the episodes go on, things will improve and I will be hooked.",2017
4,Points for effort.,2017
5,"This show has great material to work with and the premise should make for a great show. Unfortunately the script writing leaves a lot to be desired and the acting is sub par. The dialogue is awkward and unimaginative, and it feels like the script has just been recycled from another TV show. Hopefully it improves as the season progresses but so far it has been a disappointment with nothing setting it apart from any other show on TV right now.",2017
1,"sorry, not going to go all fanboy for this rehash of yet another hunted mutant show. The story line is completely predictable, the acting is very wooden (Stephen Moyer seems like he's still playing Vampire Bill), and lots of flashy CGI. Looks like Fox TV has the rights to the word ""mutant"" and can name-drop ""set in the X-Men universe"" and even some minor characters (Thunderbird, Polaris, Blink) for some fan recognition. But unless the writing and acting get better very fast this won't last a season, if that.",2017
1,Was really rooting for a new marvel series. I give mad leeway for plot flaws because I love the trend of comics to cinema. That said... My uncontrollable asshole portal power is always ONLY in front of police who just so happen to be chasing us specifically! What idiot wrote and what other idiot cleared this?,2017
5,"So far none of the characters seem to be that interesting. The acting is okay but far from outstanding. It's your classic mutant rebels VS government agency show. Maybe it's because we've already seen too much super-powered stuff but when a pilot shows you about half a dozen superpowers and none of those scenes are even remotely ""cool"" then you know this show probably won't excite you. My prediction is that the show is too boring to watch every week but the story will probably get too complicated to miss a few episodes every now and then. My advise would be to watch the pilot and make up your own mind or just skip the show altogether. This definitely won't be a show people talk about anyway.",2017
5,"I have loved the x-men universe since I was first introduced to it many years ago. When I found out there was going to be a show about it I was of course excited as FX's Legion had been absolutely amazing. Then I watched the trailer of this show and I knew at that time it would be pretty crappy but still I had to hope for the best... Sadly, I was right. I have watched three episodes so far and OH MY GOD the writing is so basic and shitty it makes me want to cease existing. Should you watch it? Yes. Maybe. I don't know. But don't say I didn't warn you.",2017
10,"All i can say about this, I went in with low expectations just based on any xmen related thing being somewhat average, however, I got chills down my spine 3 or 4 times. Just amazing that I cant actually wait till next week. The actors and actresses all Nail their parts. But Little Andy Strucker is 10/10 my favorite of the series out the bat.",2017
8,"Disclaimer: I have written this review based on all the episodes, which are out, currently that is only episode 1 :=)",2017
2,"Yawn, yet another tiresome Marvel series. Yawn, yet another tiresome Marvel Mutant series. It is sad that Fox Executives think there are enough fifteen year old boys and Nerds who live in their Mother's Basements to justify yet another tiresome Mutant themed series.",2017
8,"I gave this show a shot due to the fact it was an x-men TV show and at first I wasn't sure, but as the season has progressed I ended up really enjoying this first season of the gifted. The premise of the season sees a hidden group of mutants called the mutant underground attempt to survive will being chased down by the pro human group sentinel services. The strucker family are really the main characters on the show, Reed, kate, Andy and Lauren and they all do good jobs. Reed's character development is probably the best in the whole show as his character completely changes as the season goes on. The two kids Andy and Lauren have a lot of really interesting moments throughout the season, yes they are young so some of the acting isn't fantastic but I really liked the direction they took these characters throughout the season. To the other characters, eclipse and polaris are the mutants who have the most story to them and they go through alot during the season. Especially polaris who goes through trauma and it affects her in a fascinating way. Even the villains Dr Campbell and agent Turner are great characters the show does a great job of showing there real motivations to make them more then just a cliché villain but a character especially in Turner that you feel a bit sorry for. The story as I mentioned before is really what interested me, it starts off as pretty basic but as the show progresses and the story adds layers to it, I just felt every episode made the overall story seem more interesting and definitely kept me watching. The script is okay with some really good drama in it, considering the situation with this show it was essential to nail that. But I felt the attempts at humour that were there were pretty weak, it felt unnatural for the characters and the actors. The style shows some really cool powers shown, even though with an added budget I think they could have done more. Also I feel like towards the end of the season I feel like the show rushed a little bit and I could have done with an extra couple of episodes. Overall I really enjoyed the gifted and think it is definitely worth a watch and I will be on board when season 2 hits.",2018
10,With all the superhero series that have released over the last 3 years it has become a challenge to finde one that's not superficial and blunt.,2018

10,"The gifted is a excellent show, I love it the one thing I wish you guys would change is how many episodes are in a season there could be more detail threw out the season with more episodes and more ratings, more detail more interested people will get I love the show I just want more episodes in a season. I give the show 5 stars.",2018

Good job and keep em coming!",2018
10,"Am so glad somebody has come up with an original (of sorts) show, that is just gripping, fun, highly entertaining and even family friendly!. Wow, this would be my pick for show of the year,but... And there always seems to be a but, Fox , at this stage, has only ordered a thirteen episode stint. I could honestly see this going for far longer then that! All I can hope is that they see the benefit to this also. This show is just so good and such an homage to all things X-Men, long time in coming and will be sorely missed if not continued.",2017
10,"My God, this show took a usual plot and turned it into something so unexpected and emotional. The first three episodes were intriguing enough, though they felt a bit bland, however, the fourth episode shook me. By far, it had one of the greatest emotional impacts and episodes I have ever seen. Then it continued like that until episode 7. Then the eighth episode shook me once again! So emotional (you'll know what I mean when you watch it). ",2017
10,"Exquisite. 'Big Little Lies' takes us to an incredible journey with its emotional and intriguing storyline. The characters are so thoroughly and thoughtfully developed. Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern gave breathtaking performances. Directing, screenplay, photography, everything is brilliantly done. I would deeply recommend it.",2017
9,"I almost gave up on it after the lacklustre and uncreative beginning, but then the clever structure and intricate story-line kicked-in, followed by the interesting characters who are slowly taking form. Their purpose and meaning to the unfolding mystery is becoming evident and damn fascinating. All thanks to the performers who have already got this perfectly down-pat in the first episode, and that allows the story to take shape and meaning for the remainder of the series.",2017
10,"HBO's new limited series, Big Little Lies, is simply outstanding in every way. The casting is perfect - Reese Witherspoon as Madeline, Shailene Woodley as Jane and the always fabulous Nicole Kidman as Celeste - three very different mothers residing in the ultra wealthy enclave of Monterey, California. The show also focuses on Renata (a tense, edgy performance by Laura Dern and the families of the four main characters. James Tupper, Adam Scott, James Nordling turn in great performances, but Alexander Skaarsgard really shines as Perry, Celeste's troubled, volatile husband. ",2017

10,"This short series has all of the ingredients to be an amazing award winning show: a great cast with great perfomances, an awesome production, a kick-ass soundtrack, a good mistery, an excelent character development,... It's both realistic and surreal, it's full of nuances, of pain and joy, it's overall just an amazing experience.",2017
9,"Like a lot of viewers, there were moments when I thought I'd had enough of this show: bitchy rich women who never seem to notice how privileged they all are - for the first few episodes, you just want them all to die. But there is always something to keep you just intrigued enough to watch another episode. And then you start to see what's really going on behind the scenes of their perfect lives, and it all starts to make sense. You realize that that feeling of annoyance at all the characters was actually a clever ploy: you're meant to hate them all at the start. But by the end, you actually really like them all, and that's some clever writing, I must say. Trust me, the last few episodes fly by, and the ending is everything you'd want it to be. Clever, genuinely touching, and very satisfying without ever feeling predictable. This is a well-crafted and very well told story. Plus the cinematography and music are hypnotically beautiful. Definitely worth your time.",2018
9,"At first it felt like some kind of Korean drama. Wealthy people trapped in their social struggles. I was wondering ""why their life is so boring?"" It looked like something just repeats on and on, people talked only about what was happening, and that's it. Like they were trapped. On the good side, a lot of problems were raised, perfectness shown to be imperfect. Characters were so real, so human-like. They had doubts, regrets, we got all sides of events, not just what's happened. 
Actors are great - everyone knows these big names for good acting - but kids! They're amazing! 
But what I'd give these series 100 stars or more for is choice of soundtrack. Every time a songs plays, it gives vibe to everything that's going on. Montage is beautiful, too.
It's made very smartly, keeps viewer guessing the whole time who's done what. Also, not too long to bore, not too short to feel something's out. Sometimes watching a TV show, I feel like wasting time, not spending it, as if I could watch something better, but decided to entertain myself and do something useless. And this time it wasn't like that. 
PS. Can I just mention that soundtracks are wonderful one more time? They are!",2018
9,"After watching the first episode, which intentionally makes the viewer uncomfortable through the superficial nature of its characters, you really begin to see immense character development through the use of a beautifully written script and the performances of a very talented ensemble of actors. I have insane respect for Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, and Alexander Skarsgård for what they were able to bring to the screen, and they make the show a definite pleasure to watch.",2017
10,"It would be entirely churlish not give this superb production 10 stars out of 10. What more could a director do to make this less perfect? Particular credit must go to Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon for bringing this compelling, exciting and sensitive story into production but even more so for getting director Jean- Marc Vallée on board. And boy what a beautiful, sensitive, funny and dramatic story he's manage to render here - and with such style too. To cap it off the director has managed to extract career-best performances not just from Nicole Kidman, which should deserve credit enough all on it's own - but Reese Witherspoon, Laura Stern and the excellent Shailene Woodley all put in career-best performances - perhaps reflecting the quality of the writing, song choices, editing and filmography.",2017
9,"Look at the cast and people involved. HBO has Game of thrones, The Wire, Sopranos, etc. They set an extremely high expectation and this delivers. The night of was the last short series I loved like this. Its a short Mystery, that has a twist or two built in. Dark, well written and well acted. Very very good",2017
10,"I have HBO and NEVER watch it. I'm not a big fan of what apparently many other people like to watch. But when I saw the commercial for this I was intrigued. I never heard of the book, but highly respect many of the lead actors so I figured if they were involved it couldn't totally suck. Speaking of suck, I was completely sucked in on the first episode. I don't know why but I found this show completely and utterly mesmerizing, all the way down to the music and cinematography. Everyone involved in this from top to bottom hit it out of the park. I've never experienced this kind of life-style (ie mommy, daddy and school politics) but one of my clients who watches the show and lives in the general area said they nailed her experience when her kids were in school. ",2017
10,"The first episode established the potential here right from the start. Writing, casting and acting is on point. Great to see the cast of actors that were pulled together for the project. I hope to see more of this type of 7 episode story telling where you can get such a deep cast of actors to commit to a project that they might not otherwise be able to do if it were a typical ongoing series. In my opinion some great flawed and complex characters that aren't always what they seem on the surface (who is). In particular Reese, Nicole and Dern. In addition, the child actors, who's characters really need to support the story line, really bring it as well. Check it out.",2017
10,"Big Little Lies ... What a perfect miniseries! It is difficult to find something that can get the attention of a large audience and manages to pass a most important message to a race that is not yet so evolved ... Humans. It is touching. At the beginning presents the end of the series which brings a bit of curiosity and is what gives a fuel to continue to watch the series. From episode 3, after knowing the characters, the story takes an excellent rhythm, which brings with it mysteries, conclussions and affection or dislike to the characters. And in the end brings a breathtaking and magnificent conclusion. The performances, mainly by Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgard, bring the characters of the tray characters to us. Photography is incredible. All the components for a good series are there in Big Little Lies.",2017
8,"Impeccably caste. The performances alone should unanimously have esteemed appreciation, almost if the players are showing their personal hidden selves for all to view, feel on top of great acting... thus, exposing truth and lies that exist within humanity as well as individually. ",2017
8,"This really is the golden age of TV as proved by the fact that this mini-series stars three incredible actresses (two of them Oscar winners) giving some of their career best performances). Big Little Lies takes a hard look at the lives of women in the wealthy mostly white suburb of Monterey, where you're no one if you don't have a beach front property and where everyone hides their secrets so that they don't risk anyone seeing that their lives are a facade. ",2017
10,My opinion---,2017
9,"I hope ""Big Little Lies"" (BLL) pursues a season 2 with the same writer, director, and actors, because it's rare to see this kind of chemistry come together on the big screen, let alone television. When you have a winning combination, keep going. The way the director blends action, music, the angles, symbolism, the sense of place, it's beautiful, haunting, at times hilarious, and it carries a powerful social message.",2017
10,"What a fantastic, well produced, well acted HBO mini-series! It's a very dark show, which had me hooked from the first episode, and very easy to binge watch. I'm devastated it all came to end this week, but I take pleasure in how great this show was and how much I enjoyed it. ",2017
10,I am surprised at some of the reviews. This show has incredible depth and shows the absolute flawed and beautiful sides of humanity. ,2017
9,"It was a pretty much good first episode for a series giving all information and context. The cast is awesome. - good mystery -nice title - many questions - good direction .Take on ex-husbands and second wives, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive People who liked the movie gone girl will surely like it . So give it a go....",2017
9,"What attracted me to this TV series was the cast, however even after watching the first episode i was fascinated by its soundtrack. I feel lucky to discover some great piece of music. The acting was also impressive as one can guess. I would highly recommend it, you won't regret it :)",2017
9,Just binged watched Big Little Lies. Great show and a great cast. Although the plot twist at the end was obvious and expected it is still worth the watch.,2018
10,"When I first saw the trailer for this show, I wasn't so interested. But I'm so damn glad that I changed my mind. To me, this was a story of how women can be petty and stress about the little things in life (i.e.birthday parties and petitions), but when they use their power to lift each other up, they're capable of greatness. Everything from the acting and music to the cinematography was top notch and stunning. I finished the series in two nights and now I need a minute to catch my breath. Can't remember the last time I was this moved by a story. The ending was perfectly executed.",2017
9,"In recent times, the mystery series and movies have become little predictable. In big little lies, sure I failed to predict. Very good suspense maintained in series along with the best use of view of ocean's waves and vibes and its mysterious presence. Throughout entire series all characters get fully developed with every detail that you actually start understanding their thought process. Never a moment of dullness occurs in the series. It's a must watch series. I wish secret stays a secret..never ever it should be revealed!!",2017
4,"I'm a huge fan of the Coen Brothers. To me, cinema doesn't get much better than No Country for Old Men or Burn After Reading or Raising Arizona...you get the idea. So when I heard that George Clooney was directing their next original script, naturally I couldn't wait to see it. Fast track a year and a half later and here we are. Clooney proved to me that it takes much more than a Coen Bros script to make it a Coen Bros film. Suburbicon is one of the few films that will come about where the talent attached to the project is so overwhelming and plentiful but the final product is so mediocre and bordering on bad that it leaves you scratching your head. ",2017
2,"Suburbicon is weird. Like, really weird. And not in a good way. Like drinking coffee out of a beer can that's also spiked with orange juice. And man, is it trying its darndest to make something unique and intentional. Unfortunately, I don't know if I've ever seen a movie swing so hard and end up whiffing even harder. Suburbicon is not just weird; it's also just plain bad. To describe it would be an act of futility. It's sort of about a family dealing with death. It's sort of about racism. It's sort of a mafia comedy. It's sort of a satire of the American dream. It's sort of a familial thriller. It has some great production design, and Oscar Isaac is a blast in his short screen time. Otherwise, it's one of the most obnoxious critiques of the dark suburban underbelly I've ever seen. I have no idea how someone is supposed to plug into this movie. Predictable when trying to be sneaky, dull when trying to be exciting, awkward when trying to be funny; it gives us no character to latch onto, no story to intrigue us, no humor to overcome its darkness, and no clarity or focus to its themes. Honestly, Mr. Clooney, what is this movie? Is it a quirky comedy? Is it a dark thriller? Is it a corny message on love, or a cynical study of American justice? Whatever it is, I'll tell you what it isn't: a movie worth watching.",2017
8,"I was really disappointed when I started seeing all kinds of bad reviews for Suburbicon pop up. I was so excited to see it! I finally watched it today and I don't know what you guys are talking about. I felt it was a pretty spot on dark comedy. I didn't think it was overly gruesome. I didn't think it was confusing. I didn't think loose ends were left. On the social plane, I've seen reviews that accuse the movie of being racially inflammatory. I've also seen reviews that took the opposite stance and said that the black and white story lines never came together and the black story line was simply used as a backdrop. I don't agree. I thought it was rather entertaining that this white- washed community just attributed all the violence taking place to the new black family in the neighborhood, rather than realizing they had a couple of white sociopaths living next door. It showed how prejudice just promotes ignorance. Pretty solid message if you ask me..",2017
5,"I'm all for unique and different when it comes to filmmaking, but when a unique film doesn't do anything to intrigue its audience, aside from a consistent tone and setting, then it's not really all that impressive in the end. Suburbicon is George Clooney's latest attempt at direction, and I feel pretty much the same about this film as I did about many of his other works. A tone, story, and time period is all set up, but the way each of his films play out have seemed to leave a lot to be desired in my opinion. That is once again the case with Suburbicon, being a little too confident in itself when it came to presenting a powerful story. Here is why I think you could probably skip this one in theatres, but the effort put into it may warrant a rental if you're looking for something new to watch. ",2017
1,"Full of unresolved conflicts and senseless scenarios. Drags along with no payoff on any level. One of the main issues throughout this movie was never hinted at in previews I saw. Had I known this topic would be so pervasive, I'd had never considered seeing this movie.",2017
2,"OK, I just got out of the advanced screening of this movie, I saw the IMDb ratings drop a few points in the time it took me to drive home. I can't blame the voters. In fact, as we were leaving the staff asked if we had any comments about the movie, I winced as if in pain, my buddy was perplexed, and the guy in front of us said and I quote, ""Don't make a part two.""",2017
1,"Let me start by saying I love movies, I love Coen Bros, Wes Anderson style cinema. My family has watched at least 2 Coen Brothers movies each holiday season for many years. We quote lines literally, all of the time. Suberbicon is so slow, so meaningless, so gratuitous, that it is actually confusing to me as to why Matt Damon and George Clooney would have consented to the screenplay. Do the Coens now possess such cult like power that they can make a movie this bad, with great actors who must just shrug and say, ""It must be great. otherwise the Coens would not film it"" ",2017
1,"It may have seemed logical before, but now there's genuine proof that a Coen Brothers movie has to be both written and directed by Joel and Ethan so that the dark comedy seems genuine, palpable, and not one bit contrived...",2017
9,"This will be the first time I have ever written a review for IMDb. After watching the movie the other night, I had to check the scores on the site as I usually do. When I saw the score of a measly 4.8 out of 10 something compelled me to write this review.",2017
3,"In general, I think the Coens are best when they have full auteur-like control over the tone, dialogue, and direction of a movie. They write clever snappy scripts, but they tend to fall flat for me without their direction. I actually enjoyed the main story for awhile, but every beat was so predictable. Also the storyline about the African American Meyer family, whose presence in white 50s suburbia horrifies the neighbors when they are the most normal people in the neighborhood, feels like it should have been its own movie instead of a subplot. Especially knowing that they were based on a real family does them injustice since we didn't get any character development at all, making it hard to care. Oddly, the Meyer family subplot wasn't in the original Coens' script. You can tell there are the makings of an interesting film just beneath the surface, but that is not what made it to the screen.",2017
3,"This was just awful.... tiresome, predictable and boring. I wanted to love it, but there was nothing to even like. Top talent in every category but it fell flat, like a soufflé that did not rise. Satire should be funny, but there were few laughs. Irony may be too sophisticated to pull in an audience. It felt like something was just off - timing? Editing? It dragged on and on without reason. So sad, it coulda been a contender.",2017
1,"Something important to note is that trailers of this film completely mislead the viewer. The previews like to pretend like there's some kind of story here, but in reality there is no story. You're being sold mostly anti-white anti-""alt-right"" propaganda thinly veiled as ""entertainment."" There is no direction here. I wish I could blame this on one person, but there's little in this movie that wasn't awful. Nothing of it is salvageable. If you are thinking of watching this because you watched a trailer, don't. You're being sold something that doesn't exist.",2017
1,"Wow, this movie is some kind of horrible ode to social justice warrior wannabees everywhere. It was full of ridiculous race baiting and made very little sense. It even had a scene with a confederate flag in it... *face palm* I'm surprised it didn't cameo members of Antifa. This film was total tripe; avoid at all costs.",2017
9,"I'm very thankful I somehow avoided the many negative reviews from both users and film critics for this one before committing to seeing the film this morning. All I knew was Clooney directed it, Matt Damon starred in it, and it was probably a dark comedy about a murder investigation. But it's so much more than that. Like Get Out, this is a perfect little indictment of the #MAGA hats, only this one aims for the MAGAs content with selling out their democracy... as long as they get to pin all of their own faults on non-whites.",2017
9,This film intrigues and engages from its beautifully crafted opening titles to its unusually optimistic end.,2017
8,"I'm sorry but i am incensed to write this, the amount of people giving this film 1 star due to it being 'liberal' has just got my goat. No wonder the world despises America due to its right wing attitude...this is a film about race and equality (and a tragic premise) yet all you do is harp on about 'liberalism'?? is this such a bad thing? no! on topic, for a first time directorial debut i think Clooney has done a fine job (i studied film at university) his composition is excellent as is the setting/mood/costumes etc and the writing is sound via the Coens...stop being so bloody narrow minded people. learn to love.",2018
1,"Don't go, but if you do and you find you were duped, walk out and ask for your money back. Do not let them keep your money.",2017
2,"Writers and Producers The Coen Brothers wisely allow George Clooney to take directorial blame in this insipid ""satire?"" but their fingerprints are all over it from the sets (A Serious Man, The Hudsucker Proxy) to kitsch (Lebowski) to harebrained conniving lead (Fargo) found in Gardner Lodge vapidly played by Matt Damon. With an army of abrasive caricatures and stereotypes the boys take their sardonic style to the burbs and bomb big-time in the most blatant demeaning of a race in a major film since Birth of a Nation. ",2017
5,"A disorganized Fallout information video put into motion. While the main story has its moments, the predictability by the end leaves you bored. Also a racial subplot that needed more screen time or any kind of character development would of been nice. With 4 writers credited, it's no surprise that one covert story didn't flourish.",2017
2,"I tagged along at the last minute to the Venice Film Festival. This was one of the films we were able to see on short notice. Sorry to say, I was underwhelmed. I love Matt, and he was brilliantly scary, but the story line, even though I knew it was satire, seemed like it was trying too hard to be more than just entertainment. But all was not lost, I loved The Shape of Water, and absolutely adored Charlie Plummer in Lean on Pete.",2017
3,"2.5 stars... Satire? social commentary? murder mystery? ""Suburbicon"" (2017 release; 105 min.) is, as we learn in the movie's opening commercial, a suburban city founded in 1947 with now 60,000 inhabitants ""and the only thing missing is... you!"". We then get to know the Lodge family, with Gardner, his wife Rose, her twin sister Maggie, and their young son Nicky. One evening Gardner gets Nicky out of bed because 2 men have broken into the house and are up to no good. In a parallel story, Suburbicon is shaken up when the first African-American family moves in right next door to the Lodge family. The Suburbicon Betterment Committee is outraged. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
6,"Let's get some buts out of the way: Suburbicon is a bit of a Frankenstein's monster of a comic, sincere, horror, revenge-noir-dark insert-word-here sorta racial satire, but it's not as monstrous as one might expect given the reviews. This is clearly the work of two sets of creative teams - Joel and Ethan Coen, and then George Clooney and Grant Heslov - but it's not so stark a difference as to make the Coen's contribution seem so diminutive (as was the case with Unbroken, which still puzzles me how they got a credit on it). What works in the film most feels the most Coens-y, but at the same time we live in a world now where three seasons of Fargo the TV series exist (though with the Coens as exec producers, it's really the brain-child of Noah Hawley) which, while not perfect, delves into that same distinct world of wretched people mixed with some good people in shady-horrible crimes and moral uncertainty. In short, I'm not surprised this didn't do well.",2017
1,"This is a horrible, typical liberal anti-white anti-right propaganda garbage, for some reason liberals are hellbent on dividing our country with this types of movies, they seem to be in a complete meltdown, their like Nelly Olsen from Little House on the Prairy, when they don't get their way they go nuclear, a non stop hissy fit. George Clooney needs to retire, his acting and directing are terrible, he's just another privilege rich kid who was handed a career. Stay far far away from this trashy racist movie, we need to come together as a nation, not being divided with trashy liberal garbage movies like this!!",2017
1,After watching this movie one of the questions that pondered my mind the most was anybody actually directing this movie in a clear mindset cause this movie was so badly guided that I can't even imagine anybody on the set especially the actors not saying what in god's name are we making here. First of all the plot isn't explained at all throughout the film. You have multiple things happening and none of them line up with each other. In the beginning Thea's a whole barrage of racism peaking up when a black family all the sudden moves into this to be nice suburban area. Then all the sudden we are being thrown into a home invasion that completely takes different turns into something completely different while there's never any explanation into why this is all happening and don't have a clue why there doing what their doing and what the plot is about. I don't want to be too specific on the film cause It's not worth tirelessly explaining such a terrible film. If anybody likes this movie please tell me one thing that was remotely likable about it.,2017
9,"This is a great show, illustrating how crime has gone global, just like capitalism. One reviewer didn't like it because some villains were Russian. Did he even watch the show? There are criminals from Israel, India, Pakistan, Mexico and Czech Republic. Just because there are no Americans yet (they may yet show up), doesn't mean it's unfairly portraying Russians as criminals.",2018
8,"Something different, new and exciting. A modern take on the olden day series about ""mafia"" and I'm loving it. Using modern terminology about companies and finance which are really what makes the world go round definitely. Yes there is violence but the violence is based on the actual story that goes on and theplot is pretty great.",2018
10,"I like it a lot!
Yes, it is focused on this russian family but, I don't see it as the usual thing against russians in the movies.
The main character is the son of a big russian boss but they live in london and have ordinary life now... He is discovering his dark side during the show and he begins to like the power. Money drugs, power... I really really like it. Hope there will be a season 2.",2018
9,Story takes time to evolve but boy does it evolve. It gives a new direction to globalization of crime and how mafia work together. Love the characters and this show will definitely become a hit,2018
10,"You've got the right amount of thrill/suspense there, personal drama, characters are also written very well. Really liked the pace of the show, it's not slow at all, it's how it should be! Loved how they portrait the global scale and connections between crime organizations like a whole globalized crime world. And of course an awesome choice of native speaking actors, locations and decorations made this thing believable and alive, wasn't expected to see that level of accuracy in a tv show.
The only weird thing there is the show title. People apparently think that it is connected to McDonald's or burgers, not the best name for criminal show like that I reckon. I hope it'll have good ratings and I'll see the 2 season",2018
8,"The title has to do with a conversation (no spoilers) in the first episode referring to competing and becoming better than McDonald's. The way is told is brilliant, but I mention that because why McMafia? ",2018
9,"I really enjoyed the first two episodes of this show. The subject matter of the russian oligarchs I find fancisnating. The show is very well done and very intresting. Its has that realistic and genuine vibe. After wataching two episodes i was craving the next episode but, i had to wait a week. The cast is superb and james norton really shines. A top tier thriller. 9/10",2018
9,"I wasn't expecting much from this. I hadn't heard anything about it and really expected it to just be a low-budget stinker. I really like shows and movies about organized crime so I gave it a shot. I was very wrong. First, don't listen to the reviews saying it's too slow. It's not. It has plenty of thrilling moments. The story is very well written and tells a story of organized crime on a GRAND scale, taking you all over the world. The acting is very good and the cinematography is gorgeous! This series is not like a James Bond flick. It actually reminds me more of THE NIGHT MANAGER starring Tom Hiddleston.
I highly recommend!",2018
10,"After watching 7 episodes, I have to say it is very well done. Gets better with every episode, and I noticed a trend with the bad reviewers, which is most only watched the one episode. 
They don't realize most slow shows get better over time...because they build up the climax for the ending. ",2018
10,"A great series, finally a small detachment of action remained a crime - punishment - all admit - constipation. The action perfectly displays the mafia display from the same book. An excellent selection of the main actor (likely to be the new James Bond). Some scenes may be a little too strong for soft cutie :).",2018
8,"As the series progresses I think it's getting better and better, it's gripping, high octane, pulse racing viewing. The McMafia name I'm assuming is an attempt to show the globalisation of crime, how something can quickly spread worldwide, crime is unfortunately global these days. I get why the Russians are a little miffed as there is a bit of Russian bashing in it, but in real life there are Russian criminals, as in deed there are British and Israeli (American etc.) James Norton impresses in everything he does, McMafia is another in the list of successes for him. Is this a pre empt for James Bond, time will tell. So the series perhaps starts off a little slow, and is very political heavy in its story telling, but it's intelligent, compulsive, gripping viewing, more please.",2018
1,"Regrettably its hard to take the mainstream media seriously anymore. One of the biggest elephants in the living room of late is the neo McCarthyism ""Reds Under the Bed"" codswallop coming out of the US and UK which has had ample air time. ",2018

1,I've bailed on this after enduring the whole of the first episode.,2018
6,"Every country has its share of gangsters, sadly, but in Russia there's a criminal elite that first robbed the old Soviet state, and is now tightly emeshed with the new one. This should make for an interesting drama; but unfortunately, 'McMafia' isn't quite it. Firstly, its a tale of international drug smuggling, in glamorous locations, but there's not much detail in its portrait of Russian politics, which I might have found more interesting. Secondly, the idea of the quiet respectable gangster, who loves his beautiful family, and has others do his dirty work for him, is all very well, but when every character fits the same archetype it makes for a flat story Thirdly, the hero - a suppodesly clean banker who is drawn into the dark web of his criminal family - is unconvincing - we need to believe in his purity before he goes over to the dark side. Overall, this didn't come to life for me - a shame given the potential of the scenario.",2018
9,"A really great show with a very interesting and multifaceted story. Russia, England, Israel, Czech Republic, India, family love, money laundering, brutality, murder, power, drug and human trafficking, investment bankers, shipping agencies, this show has got it all (and even much more than that)!
IN EIGHT EPISODES! ",2018

I'm not even giving spoilers away here. It's just not worth it. Unless you like void, emptiness looking like deepness, conspiracy with no knowledge, and void again, ...
I jumped to episode 4. Without looking, just listening. 
It's masturbation of the mind. Spiced up with some low level fake deepness. If I could I would give it minus 10. The actors are handsome. I like their watch. Nice landscapes too.
Apart from that? Nil.",2018
1,"I only made it through episode 1, and that was painful. Episode 1 was so incredibly lackluster that it just isn't worth the time. A very subpar series. Also, James Norton playing a Russian? Really? He not only does not look the part, he doesn't even attempt to speak Russian, which the character supposedly spoke from childhood. Very implausible. I like James Norton, but his portrayal of this character is bland and unbelievable; he needs a truly ""meaty"" role in order to shine. This isn't it. I predict that this series won't last long; too bad Norton bowed out of Grantchester for the sake of playing this role. He should have stuck with a series that was good.",2018
8,"I honestly don't get what the critics wanted from this movie! Especially that one guy who called this the ""worst movie of 2017"". REALLY? That's a huge lie...what about The Emoji Movie or The Snowman, or Al Pacino's movie, The Hangman??? Anyway, if you're expecting Suicide Squad...STOP. It's nothing like Suicide Squad, in terms of the acting, the action, the emotional/serious moments and the overall quality. It's much, much better than that movie, for anyone who was comparing to that movie. Now, It's not Hacksaw Ridge or The Godfather type quality, it's a typical buddy-cop set-up in a twisted, yet fun, fantasy environment. Think Lethal Weapon/Training Day/End of Watch meets Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit. Sounds weird, but you'll be pleasantly surprised.The chemistry between Will and Joel is great, the action is great and pretty much anytime Will and Joel have serious moments those are basically some of the most memorable ones out of the whole movie. There are very minor flaws, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Bright and I think audiences will too, I mean, go ahead and google the audience reviews. It's a Netflix movie, if people can enjoy bad movies and shows on Netflix, then people will definitely like this one. It's clearly a ""people's movie"", not a ""critic's movie"". WATCH IT and ENJOY!",2017
9,"After reading about how poorly this movie was made and how much of a flop it was, I wasn't very surprised to find that it was much better than the reviews were admitting to. While the world is vast and leaves some questions unanswered, that by no means makes the movie hard to follow or less enjoyable to watch. The action was fantastic, the characters were portrayed very well, and the humor was spread throughout to break the tension. I could see how much older viewers who aren't accustomed to a fantasy setting might have a hard time to follow, but if you're like me and prefer the fantasy genre you will most likely enjoy watching this movie.",2017
6,"Firstly, let me just say regarding the critics score, if you can give The Last Jedi 86% and then give this 28% you have zero credibility. Sure, critics have always been harsh and sometime don't follow popular opinion, but that's just clearly pandering to the big studios so you're not black listed and trying to appear credible by slamming this film.",2017
9,"I just watched it and started to look online for more information about the ""universe"" of the movie, which I wouldn't have done if I didn't like the movie and stumbled over the movie ratings and critics. It's really confusing because the movie looked great and I had fun watching it. The orcs looked fantastic, the elfs were bitchy and Will Smith was Will Smith. The only thing I didn't like was the face Will is doing so much lately. I think the face situation started in After Earth... he needs to shake that off. Everything else was fun.
Maybe the critics hyped themselfs to much by saying this will ""end hollywood"" and stuff. But instead it is a great action movie sponsored by Netflix with fantasy and social/racial elements in it.",2017
8,I twist on buddy cop movie. Will Smith and the Orc play off each other perfectly. I could see this is how it would be if Middle Earth got pushed into our present day.

Some of these answers are thrown quickly into the dialogue but don't hold as much weight as they should.

LAPD police officer Dayl Ward (Will Smith) is the first human cop having the orc police officer Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) as partner. When Ward is shot by an orc and Jakoby does not capture the shooter, he questions whether Jakoby lets the fellow orc escape. During a patrol, Ward and Jakoby arrest a man that tells that there is a prophecy and Ward is blessed. Meanwhile, Internal Affairs press Ward to find the truth about the escape of the shooter so that they can fire Jakoby. The magic department of the FBI interrogates the man that belongs to the terrorist Shield of Light group and they learn that they are preparing the return of the Dark Lord that will destroy the world. Ward and Jakoby are summoned to attend a disturbance and they stumble upon a Shield of Light safehouse where they arrest the elf Tikka (Lucy Fry) and her magic wand. Soon they learn that Tikka is hunted down by the evil and powerful elf Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and her gang and they need to protect Tikka and the wand; otherwise the world will be destroyed.

3,"'Bright' should have taken some pointers from its title and lightened up a little. How seriously are we expected to take a film which features orc gangsters, elves using iPhones and a fight between Will Smith and a fairy? *Very* seriously, it seems. Smith is given a few lines that are reminiscent of Alonzo from 'Training Day', but apart from these brief pauses from gloom the film is entirely devoid of humour.
The world-building is far too superficial. There are even references to 'Shrek' in this film. Sometimes allusions to pop culture and the real world work in fantasy (e.g. in Stephen King's 'The Dark Tower' books and Terry Pratchett's 'Discworld' series), but it's a total misfire here. The world of 'Bright' seems to be a carbon copy of our own world, and we're just expected to accept the fact that it happens to feature elves, orcs, magic and the like.
The specifics of the film aren't as bad as its premise: the performances are fairly decent (Edgerton does what he can but is heavily restricted by his character), the soundtrack is forgettable but passable, and the visuals are occasionally impressive. 
I can't recommend 'Bright' to anyone in sincerity - the world-building is comparable to something a 13-year-old would produce for a creative-writing project. I was drawn to this film after asking myself the question of how director David Ayer and writer Max Landis make a premise like this work... the answer: they don't.",2017

But Bright fails on nearly every level.",2017

It seems as though they could have started the story line with that and moved forward.. I love Nomie Rapace and can't figure out why she keeps getting put in the worst movies.

1,What a mess...,2017
1,"I found this film to be very sleep worthy, in fact I had to check the plot afterwards as I kept dozing off. Very cheesy American human interest story about the relationship between two brothers was its central theme. The sci-fi was badly thought out and made Gerry Anderson look like an expert. The highlight for me was when the baddie was revealed to be a disciple of Trump. I left the cinema muttering 'we should have invested more in renewable energy'.",2017
1,"Geostorm, where the Secretary of State creates god-like weather forces in attempt to destroy the world of all lesser people, and almost does it way too easily. Not only is the plot of this movie utterly dull and without substance, the dialogue and character development were created with very little thought or attempt to create a serious disaster movie. At times, different conversations that go on throughout the movie are completely laughable, for example, the relationship between Jake Lawson (Gerald Butler) and his brother Max (Jim Sturgess). It's almost like they finished writing the movie, and the group of people in charge of dialogue needed some type of power battle and controversy, despite the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs-type weather scenario. Actually, Geostorm doesn't even deserve to be in the same sentence as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, because Geostorm tries to make their weather seem realistic in a catastrophic type scenario when in reality it isn't even close. There's a better chance of animals or food coming from the sky than anything shown in Geostorm. Therefore, I'm going to explain in depth why each part of the movie's ability to control the weather and how it acts, is just plain made up Hollywood movie magic.
 First of all, the way the movie depicts the controlling of weather makes absolutely no sense. To shoot bullet-like pieces from space into a storm to release some form of technology that would entirely dissipate the storm is simply just impossible. Even shooting a bullet into a hurricane does nothing but create a very dangerous object that could strike and kill somebody. The idea that hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of these pods that enter a storm and destroy it entirely wouldn't do the exact same thing important to remember. The impact of these pods were only in one location, yet the entire storm went away in the flash of an eye, which is just Hollywood magic. The atmosphere is so big that if something were to affect a portion of it, it would not have an overall effect on the atmosphere as a whole, it would be isolated; that's how the atmosphere works the way it does. The fact of the matter is that even a volcanic eruption or a gigantic nuclear warhead could not deter or even change the direction of some of the storms shown in the movie to evaporate before our eyes.
 The first freak accident to occur in the movie was when the small town in Afghanistan is frozen instantly, causing everyone there to die instantaneously. For this to occur there would need to be a zone of such extreme low pressure that the temperatures would drop that dramatically, but at this time, there is no such ""freeze ray"" that could complete such a ridiculous task. Another great freak accident that makes also zero sense is why Dubai gets practically washed away (the water would destroy the foundations of those buildings due to the rocking back and forth) and somehow it is at the fault of the satellites. At some point, it seems like the creators of this movie gave up on any feasible weather patterns or potential disastrous storms and just went for the disasters that made the least sense.
 Lastly, the entire appeal of this movie is from the creators of the movie entirely making up the term ""geostorm"", as if there was a term for a massive slew of tornadoes, tsunamis and earthquakes. All of the significant weather depicted in the movie is over exaggerated to the point that it isn't even possible on earth's surface. The fact is that this movie was created as a cash grab for the people who think recent natural disasters mean our world will soon be at risk to far worse, but in reality, it's all just conspiracy theories right now. Although the movie is portrayed as a scientific thriller, it's more of an imaginative world where science and more specifically the science behind weather, do no exist. After asking a current PhD meteorologist who works for weather.us if he had any details that would help me right this review, his response was, ""I would not subject myself to that mental torture.""",2017

1,Clichés and predictability abound. Was this deliberate or did everyone miss the mark by miles? The distance between intentional laughs is great but not to worry as you will find yourself laughing during chase scenes and the heard it before soooo many times canned dialogue stripped from the shelves of the most generic action movies. Think Moonlighting a la Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepard meets any line spoken by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Perhaps this will be the springboard for director Dean Devlin for bigger and better things as even James Cameron had to start somewhere. Save your money and valuable time by staying home and watching Babe: Pig in the City. If you do decide to see this slapstick of a movie I suggest you pass the time by counting how many times you laugh out loud at the cheesier than a Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco dialogue.

Hollywood does it's best making these style movies as real as possible. Looking back at Volcano and Dante's Peak even those were done well for their time. It was nice to see Ed Harris and Andy Garcia in a movie too, seems like these guys take big breaks between movies.

Three years later accidents start to happen killing many people so the main scientist is convoked and sent back for an audit. It does not requires a lot of thinking to understand there is a conspiracy somewhere and that one of those old but great actors must be the culprit. In any case; the movie pace never slows down to let you think about the obvious and to stop being entertaining.,2017

Instead, Disney, was so busy being PC by making a girl win that they actually WERE being ageist. When you pay to see Lightning win, and he doesn't cross that finish line, you have failed as writers.

1,"I warning you all right now SPOILER ALERT. So one might believe that this film would be about lightning feeling bad after his big wreck and wanting to train and work hard to beat the car that made him feel that way but no it's about him training while everyone is tearing him down with the excessive old age jokes, and telling him that he will never be fast enough to beat the car who caused him to feel that way in the first place but despite that lightning continues to train and failing at every point which by this time who would think he would see some progress but no it's quite the opposite he gets slower and the cherry on it all toward the end of the movie it's the big race against the character Storm so lightning starts the race after the first lap he quits and sends in this flat character Cruz to take lightning's number and finish the race despite the character Cruz has no racing experience and she magically beats all the new racers including lightning's rival Storm but it gets worse after the race lightning retires from racing(despite throughout the whole movie him saying that he will never retire) and lightning becomes Cruz's coach. It gave no closure to lightning's story and not to mention the character Doc is dead without any explanation but magically the truck that trained Doc and was older than Doc was still alive which again makes no sense. So to sum it up lightning retires and becomes a defeatist. Don't watch unless you want your kids to be disappointed.",2017
3,"In this one, Lighting struggles to keep up with the new young techno cars on the circuit and has to go find his racing mojo. Along the way he meets a young racing car who is ironically his trainer, it turns out she is the one who needs the training from Lighting. Lighting teaches her his techniques, whilst trying to improve himself. ",2017
1,"Film makers say that a bad movie clearly falls apart. You can easily break it down for analysis, unlike a good one. ITS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE TERRIBLE CLIMAX OF THIS MOVIE WAS WRITTEN FIRST AND THE REST OF IT WAS JUST MADE UP ARTIFICIALLY FOR IT. Trailer advertised something else. Think of a Batman movie where Batman is having a nice time in Hawaii beach and some unknown guy does all the ninja stuff to defeat the villain. Enough said.",2018

1,We all expect our lead character McQueen to win or do something interesting every time but this movie is all opposite.... It's just about his retirement..... It talks about new generation racers who are better than the old ones.... Everything McQueen had is hopelessness... He loses all hope and hands over his career to a girl racer making himself retired..... he declares himself shower than the others and takes up a blue paint in memory of Hudson hornet and becomes a crew chief... Cars has always been my favourite Disney movies since my childhood but thus movie made me real upset...I was really not expecting this...... It is surely the worst Disney movie ever....,2017
1,"Let me start by saying I love the Cars movie franchise, so when I first saw the trailer and the poster for this latest instalment, I was very excited.",2017
1,"My son was born in 2006, we watched first movie maybe a hundred times, and second one several times. Cars was like Star Wars for us. And 3rd movie? At the end of the movie my 11 years old son was so upset to see Mc Queen as a retiring loser car, he only said: ""I'll never talk about Mc Queen, this is the end"". Bugs Bunny does not get old, why did you have to retire Mc Queen so early? And we hate that yellow car, Cruz, it can never replace Mc Queen. Mc Queen is red, how could you turn it to blue?! This movie is a big disappointment, we'll try to forget it",2017
1,"All i have to say, way to completely ruin the franchise and take a dump at the mcqueen's legacy. Doesn't Disney already have enough female protagonists as it is? Yes, Cars 1 did great, Cars 2 was terrible, but cars 3 is horrible. I am honestly surprised to see that the third installment has got almost same ratings as Cars 1. ",2017
3,"The first Cars movie is a classic that will be enjoyed for a long time to come. Cars 3 a has a few major problems. - We don't want to live in or know about whatever 'new reality' this movie has created, where Lightning isn't the fastest car anymore. We especially don't want to know that there is an entire new generation of cars that are faster than him. How depressing is that. - The movie has very little of the heart, soul, and humor of the original. It has a very different feel, with the 'next gen' cars speaking and acting like spoilt millennials. Jackson Storm is a nasty piece of work. - If feels like the point of the movie is to reinforce that 'girls can do anything' (like most movies these days). That's all well and good, but it's not what we paid money to actually go and see. We want to watch a movie about the movie's actual hero and main character, Lightning Mcqueen. And we want to see him win and NOT be depressed, old and slow most of the time.",2017
6,"First of all, let me get this out of my system: I've seen many 1-2 stars reviews out there. While I understand why those people are upset I think 1/10 is way too low. The movie isn't inherently bad, it's not a disastrous mess of burning oil like some reviewers make it to look. But it's not great either.",2017
4,"I went to see Cars 3 with my younger sister and, as a long-time Pixar fan, I guess I have to finally face the music: Pixar movies are simply not as good as before anymore. The first installment of Cars, even though not as beloved as some of the studio's other efforts, was a heartfelt and entertaining story for kids and adults alike. This, on the other hand, was an incoherent mess with so much boring and unnecessary dialogue it makes your head hurt after leaving the theater (but you're still happy it's all over)",2017
2,"This movie had no dimension beyond Lightning McQueen trying to win one more race only to never actually race one more race. The other characters of the original movie make scarce appearance, and we basically spend the whole movie watching Lightning McQueen get ready to race the final big race but then never actually race the big final race (because he ""passes the torch"" to this flat and uninteresting new racer car called Cruz Ramirez who is about as interesting as a 1982 Toyota Corolla).",2017
1,"What happened?... Are they trying to shutdown some ""old"" franchises?... this movie is a total anti-climax, you go in full of expectations and go out trying to forget it... to keep the good old memories... it is sad... they completely abandoned the universe created in Cars 1 and 2 and all other spin-offs... they tried to do something new, a new perspective, but did not develop anything beyond a scratch deep... nothing makes any sense... no fun... no logical connection among story developments... I will try to forget it... but it will be though... in the end there is no hero left...",2017
3,"So, I have always been a huge fan of Cars and it's franchise. I was 9 years old when the first movie came out and as a kid I became obsessed with the movie. At the age of 20, I can say that I still love the original movie as much as I did when I first saw it in theaters all those years ago. ",2017

2,"Took my kids a boy and girl to see this and within the first 30 minutes, my little girl rolled her eyes and already knew how the story would end. Disney is ruining these classic movies with whatever agenda they have. Almost all things Disney these days are predictable and unimaginative. My son didn't like it, neither did my daughter and at the end of the night, I wanted my money back.",2017
1,"I am a huge cars fan, I absolutely loved the first movie, the second movie was still really good, but the first was a classic. ",2017
10,"I've never written a review in my life. After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance. ",2017
10,"To begin, I believe that most people visiting these pages are intelligent enough to tell the difference between those that are reviewing this series with honesty versus the ones who for reasons other than the viewing experience, wish to tear it down. As someone has already mentioned, the negative reviews are fraught with fear and the worst kind of delusion that exists: self delusion (the delusion a person hides behind and convinces themselves of in order not to see the truth).",2017
10,"If I may start 'off-topic' for a moment. I am male, mid sixties, and have watched, like many others, all the great (and not-so-great) horror films. After watching the ten episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. It makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy. After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach. In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying. I'm sorry I can't find better words to describe how this show affects me. I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close.",2017

1,"I remember reading Margaret Atwood's book many years ago, and at the time I felt it was original, great at world-building, and the dystopian view was truly chilling.",2017
1,"I really tried to like this series. Turned out it's really over rated and borderline boring. It takes 10 episodes to tell a story that could easily been told in 3. Everything has to be shown again, and again, and again. We know already that's everybody's suffering. We know that it's dreary, and dark, and that every woman that wears red is slaves. We don't need 10 hours to understand that. I have nothing against slow but when it's done just to be artsy and to fill out the programming time, it gets silly. How about some hope? How about some good plot twists, or at least some interesting things happening? Yes, I know you want to tell a story about religion, refugees, and what happens in a totalitarian state. But... doesn't everybody know that already. Don't you think the people who don't know would get it after... hmmm.... let's say Three hours? Do you really need to rub it in and press it down our throats? I don't get why this has got such a good Reviews. Is it just because it's PC?",2017
10,"Strong is the word for this series, and little, weak people detest strong so be prepared for the fake reviews and thumbs down across the actual reviews for it. Fear is a powerful thing.",2017
2,"Much of the buzz about ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is that this is what could happen if America turned into a Christian theocracy. I'm not a religious person, but I don't see how anything in the show matches up with any Christian doctrine. Religious people I know don't have practices that match anything in ""The Handmaid's Tale"". Especially the part about keeping a mopey girl around the house so you can bang her to have kids. Yeah, I know, the women are infertile, but wouldn't a clinical method of getting the mope pregnant be more likely? This dystopian future is highly structured, with plenty of cultural taboos and enforcement infrastructure. How did this all get implemented? All the characters have a recent history, so this societal reboot happened in a span of five years? I can't imagine it in America. Gays have been a political force for 40 years and they just recently got the right to marry.",2017
2,"I've read the original novel of Margaret Atwood, which I have very much enjoyed, because it had a very important message namely a women's worth and goal in life should not be to procreate only. One message I remember particularly is the line of Offred (Jane)to her mother: ""I am not your justification for existence."" This line has stuck with me ever since.",2017
10,"This story is terrifying (especially if you are a female). Imagine what happens when the world goes completely crazy and some new completely sadistic world order emerges who claims their acts of incredible cruelty, murder, control , oppression and slavery are all in the name of some mystical God that no one has seen, spoken to or has any proof exists and yet uses the name of God to justify the most horrific and barbaric atrocities.

9,"People aren't really falling for the negative reviews, right? As a dude who has watched it with his girlfriend, I need to agree that the negative reviews are ridiculous. I can imagine the same person thumbing down the real reviews. Lol. Pathetic.",2017
1,"I got to episode 3 and just had to Bing it online to see if anyone else felt the same way as I did. Seeing all the bad reviews online, I can see I am not alone. If they want to get an agenda or viewpoint across, a little subtlety would help. The obvious manipulation is laughable. So laughable that I am not even offended. Just mad I wasted 3 hours. I should have given up after episode 1. It does not get better!! LOL and very BORING, tedious and drawn out.",2017
10,"Like others on here, I too could regale you with moving words that would depict my experience and thoughts while watching this. I thought it best however to simply suggest that those who believe such a thing could not happen, or that we are nowhere near what is depicted in this show, scroll down and read the review by gene0915 from United States (unfortunately it has been deleted or removed now).",2017
2,"After hearing great things about this show, I gave it a try. I watched the first three episodes to make sure I was giving it a fair chance. The production quality is decent, and the acting isn't awful. I find myself actually liking some of the characters. But that's about all this show has going for it. ",2017
1,"I've no religion myself but it still strikes me how the cowardly sentiments of this show take cheap pot shots at Christianity. It is not this religion that subjugated women nor would attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government. The writer(s) of this dystopian portrayal are clearly too cowardly to point the finger at religions that do in fact have these avowed intentions. Other than that it is a very slow moving, rather boring semi sci-fi tale set in a dystopian near future. No attempt is made to create a wider perspective of this world or display any outrage from other countries. I gather this is based on a popular book of which I had never heard so I hope the book was much better.",2017
4,"I watched the film version of The Handmaid's Tale several years ago so the storyline was pretty familiar and the film I might give six or seven stars. However, in this adaptation, I had expected a little more than mere filler to justify the extended length. I don't think there was a major plot point which was not in the film. Both film and television versions seemed very two-dimensional, it has to be said, the dystopian world in which it was set seemed to operate without any explanation of what those in this world who do not occupy one of the roles we see actually do. It was a bit like looking at the cardboard set of a cheap sci-fi movie with banks of unconvincing fake spinning tape reels and purposeless flashing lights. The dystopia may have only existed in the lives of the households of the commanders and the lives of the handmaids for all the viewer knew; everything else was hidden from view. In the film, perhaps this was acceptable but in ten hours we learned more about the characters' lives in our near present than we did about the world into which they were forced.",2017
5,"The idea is creative and the theme relevant to our times but the execution and acting are slow-moving and most of the plot is either signaled or obvious. The story-teller, Offred, doesn't make it easy to empathize. There is a heaviness about the direction and production design that is key to the subject but it is not an easy watch.",2017
10,"In a nutshell, the story is real. ",2017
4,"I was mesmerized by the novel when I first read it. And again when I read it prior to seeing the movie. (A stinker.) And yet again when I heard it was being serialized for the small screen. It is an important work by a master wordsmith. Unfortunately, Atwood's considerable talents couldn't save the movie, and it appears they will be unable to save the serial. She should never have allowed Bruce Miller and MGMTV to extend the project past ten episodes. The impact is lost. The vision becomes obscured. An important piece of literature is exploited for the sake of Twitter memes and political talking points.",2017
1,"Awful and boring beyond human comprehension. The pretentious eggplants fawning and salivating over this stultifying, boring dreck must be lonely beyond belief because they can't possibly have a spark of interesting conversation. I watched the tenth episode after the first to realize what I knew was going to happen. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! The season climaxes with Moss dropping a rock in slo mo defiance. WHOOOO!!!! Everybody is virtually the same after 10 episodes with a minor blip. Speaking of Moss; I'm going to boycott anything she's in because it tends to suck. Mad Men. Top of the Lake and now this. She is duller than dull. No likable characters ( they barely register a pulse ). Making Yvonne plain looking. Men are barely more than robotic animals ( you can't climax just pumping in and out unless you're an animal. ). Lifeless direction and stagnant scenes. Scenes that start nowhere and end nowhere. Another meaningless interracial family. These are some of the horrors inflicted upon us. The only thing they get right is that all religion is evil ( especially Christianity, which is the worst ). People championing this; please seek help.",2017
2,"great production values; costumes, sets and action sequences, but terrible writing and the direction was abysmal -----has there been a show on TV that is this slow? Did the broadcaster want 10 episodes and they only had scripts for five and the production team said no problem and them made every scene 3 times longer than necessary? ",2017
1,Well. The acting is great. The director did a great job. We see technical elements at their best...,2017
10,"To begin, the book it is based on was written in the 80's, before the IVF - however, the reason they use coitus is because of the puritanical system of beliefs they have established in the land and which they base EVERYTHING on. As in the bible which they quote Genesis 16:1 ""Now Sarai, Abram's wife had borne him no children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar. Sarai said to Abram, ""Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will obtain children through her."" Seriously, for people speaking of ""IQ's"", this shouldn't be hard to grasp.",2017
2,"I don't give a damn about how politically relevant this show is, how nicely it portrays the future stupid,pious Christians are leading us to, the social commentary it has. One thing every writer must understand, you are writing a story, I don't mind if you push your ideology here and there, but it must have a story worth watching.",2017
4,I hated to see such great actors coming together in a pretty bad movie. The plot was silly and some of the characters were overdone and equally silly (Poppy). The Elton cameo was good for the first scene then was way over done. So many things wrong after a pretty good first movie. Please don't make another one.,2017
3,"Why is it that so many fun, inspired originals are followed by such lame, poorly written (and juvenile) sequels? ",2017
3,"""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a long, boring and overrated film. The story is silly and the jokes are unfunny, wasting a cast with famous names and countless cameos. This spoof of 007 and other agent movies never works since it is too violent for a comedy and too dumb to be taken as a serious espionage movie. The good thing is that the viewer can take a nap along the boredom and will not miss anything. The lead couple has no chemistry and the romance is also terrible. My vote is three.",2017
1,"I loved the first Kingsman movie. It was full of action, fun, jokes and the actors did a great job. I came into this movie theater hoping to delight myself with a sequel that would at least match the first installment. As soon as the first scene came on the screen, I knew I had been fooled and it would end up being some of the most dreadful 2 hours in my movies watching history! I was right. This movie might have some actions but every moment is ""telephoned"" long in advance. The story is absolutely stupid. I wish it would be possible to request a full refund when a movie is that bad and that each refund is counted towards its overall success/failure. It is not fair that people are getting paid with my money receiving millions of dollars for such a poor performance. The day this option becomes possible we might finally see some serious work being done in the movie industry!",2017
4,"If a movie would ever be produced to show the backstory of the Roger Moore version of James Bond—what his childhood was like, and how he became who he was—that movie would probably closely resemble 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."" ",2017
1,"1(awful).... Actually that is a KIND rating, but there's no option for a negative rating so I went as low as I could. Simply stated, I went to this film on the basis of its prequel which while not great, was entertaining. This film is so STUPID and poorly written that I'm frankly astonished that any of the ""talent"" hired to play the roles, agreed to do it at all lest their resumes be thoroughly sullied. I've walked out of 3 or 4 movies in my life. Tonight I added another. Don't waste your time unless you enjoy AWFUL films and you're a cinematic masochist. My time would have been better spent sorting socks.",2017
1,"I almost never feel the extreme urge to write a review but this time - since I am sincerely disappointed, I can't control myself.",2017
2,"It is ironic that when a writer concocts so many sub-plots which take the audience off the Hero's main goal/desire, the main story line gets lost in the shuffle. This was what was happening in the first 10 minutes, until we got to the change of venue at Poppy's hang-out. We are introduced to the psychopathic opponent, Poppy, who does not flinch when one of her ""soldiers"" is committed into a meat grinder. She calmly makes a ""humanburger"" out of the hapless sub- opponent; dares her next ""soldier"" to eat the thing, while the audience tries to avoid vomiting. Not necessarily because of the disgusting concept of grinding a human being and then filming the ""humanburger"" for all to see, but because of just plain grossly overplayed attempts at humor with a classless script. ",2017
2,"What I thought of Kingsman: The Golden Circle The humor was predictable and cringe worthy, the plot minus well be nonexistent, they barely develop/use the villain. All the characters that were cool in the first movie were given nothing to do. And the new characters that they do introduce are so irrelevant that they minus well not be there. There is only one new character that is given anything to do, but he is so obviously a secondary villain waiting to be revealed that he should just have been a secondary villain to begin with. There was also a bunch of attempts at shock humour attempt, but those were just more obnoxious than actually shocking. The action is also not really well done, because there are times where you just can't really tell what's happening. The movie keeps zooming in unnecessarily because I guess the director thought that looked cool. I basically hated almost everything about this movie, and what I didn't hate, I was completely indifferent towards it",2017

They also assume that the F word is always funny as they just stack one uttering on the other, over and over.On every level this expensive syrup honks to the core.It is all in the trailer which mercifully was two and a half minutes not two hours twenty one, in true turkey style the film is packed with big names taking big cheques that means they don't care that they have embarrassed there career.All the jokes nods and satire's fall splat flat, then there is the action which is hardly exciting as all is so vastly over the top.Exactly how anyone can imagine there is 221 minutes of entertainment in this grim, dare i say blockbuster is beyond me.Judging by the rustling of feet and popcorn around me this movie was not hitting many targets.The pit was reached when sir Elton John filled the screen from corner to corner yelling F-F-F. It has been i am told the worst summer at the north American box office in 20 years and little wonder it has been a summer season filled with tired laboured sequels, prequels, reboots, and remakes all lacking originality and little in the way of skilled film making, this Kingsmen debacle simply tops of a doomed industry.Who must go back to film school and learn real film making,with real story's, it does not take $200 million a pop, but it does take talent.Not F's!",2017

6,"It's essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at the few select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, a joke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardless of its negative impact on the story in a standoffish move meant to further separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', a move that only successfully provides both categories with a much worse experience, because while I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or at least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't want a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered the weakest aspects of the piece - elements which were only mitigated by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of the other parts such as the subtle yet witty satire and the very well developed characters, pieces of the puzzle now missing; though it is at times passively entertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers 'save-the-world' plot and a string of odd action set- pieces seemingly incompetently put together, with abhorrent use of rampant speed- ramping making it literally look like someone hit the fast-forward button and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them look like cheap cartoons - in his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn disappointingly squanders all of the good-will he had built with his predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on, wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters instead of working with the better characters already expertly established at the end of the prior title, while also reintroducing a previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning franchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain it's relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood. 6/10",2017

Something that he never ceases to portray is the messed up realism that is hidden within our world and the Florida Project capture this in the most purest and colorful of ways.,2017
9,"Beautifully humane film that at times recalls Italian Neo-Realism, at other times the child-based films that are so popular in Iran. That it was made in the USA, with a real if humble budget, seems surprising and is a testament to the commitment of the filmmakers. ",2017
8,"It's only fitting that in the shadow of the corporate mouse...a society of people who live on the fringe would exist. In Florida (specifically Orlando) the desperate existence thrives on people who go off the beaten path...and actually get lost. That is where Halley (newcomer Bria Vinaite) and her daughter Moonee (played by another newcomer Brooklynn Prince) exist. Halley...seems to be a club kid who got knocked up by a man who shortly abandoned her. In some tribal/white trash code of religion, it seems she thought having a child would make her grow up. Not quite. Because the princesses' castle is within reach, it's still a world away. And that is heartbreaking. Imagine being a person unable to grow up (like what Disney promotes). Those dreams withered and died, but the worst residual effects remained. Which is the Magic Castle. A hovel of a (what one unsuspecting tourist calls a ""gypsy project"") dump managed by Bobby, played wonderfully sympathetic character Willem Dafoe. Bobby patiently overlooks the ship of fools and sometimes, babysits, though by default. Most who live there have feral children who explore the grounds and beyond out of boredom. The residents here are...they are who you think should live there. Look, this film is about character. There is zero plot, so don't go looking for a story. The reality of the people who live here are brutal. Like...on edge scary where you're not entirely sure you want anyone to exist here. But they do. Moonee is a lovely little girl caught up in an adult world she doesn't fully comprehend, but is forced to deal with. Halley is obviously a broken toy herself. And in a very quiet effective scene, we see glimpses of Halley coming to terms with what the world requires of her as parent (""pepperoni costs money"").",2017
9,"I really liked this film, as unorthodox as it was. The first hour was uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to the plutocracy we see all around us today. ",2017
5,"The Florida Project is the third feature film from writer-director Sean Baker and, while being an improvement over Tangerine and Starlet, The Florida Project is still missing the heart it needs to be an everlasting and impactful film. From his cinematic conception, Baker has had a knack for showing very dingy lifestyles bursting with a color palate that would make George Miller weep. But underneath the colorful array that he includes is a superficial mess of a film. One that thinks it is smarter and more heartfelt than it really is. ",2017

9,"Beautiful movie which could be considered a parody of Disney's aesthetic and didactic content. The movie's parody is willingly conventional and at the same time the efforts in directing children, in the amazing cinematography and set design are truly recognizable; still it feels like there's something missing, even though the story has everything it needs to be an entertaining piece about white American trash struggling with ordinary life in a fable-like environment. Actually there is really nothing to complain about, that feel is simply produced by the decay surrounding the lovable protagonist, which is deliberately sugar-coated as only a child's mind could manage it. SPOILER (?): The very final sequence, which I kinda felt to happen few seconds before, is a very well-fitting example regarding the masterful level of Baker's self- awareness in the use of parody as a cinematic striking weapon.",2017
2,"I have read several of the high star rated reviews and still cannot understand why this film is so highly rated.Both my daughter and I went to see this film as a "" Screen Unseen "" (This is where you go to see a film at a reduced cost but don't know what film is being shown)Because of the reduced cost these showings attract a large amount of people.When the film started the cinema was around three quarters full after the first 10 mins people started to leave (this is not unusual)by the end of the film there was only around a third of the original number remaining (including my daughter and myself this is unusual)The ending was so strange it was as if someone had just cut off the film with no explanation and a big WHAT! came from the remaining audience, A total waste of 2 hours of my life see it at your peril.",2017
6,"I had been looking forward to seeing this new film directed by Sean Baker ever since reading the rave reviews for it that came out of Cannes and Toronto. While I can say that this film is beautifully filmed and features strong acting, it doesn't quite hit the mark. The film is about a poor young girl, raised by a single mother, and her friends who live in a run-down motel close to Disney World near Orlando, Florida. ",2017
2,"When I go to a movie, I want to be entertained, inspired or enlightened. This movie did not. I gave 2 stars because the acting is good, but the plot is thin, annoying and stressful. Most of the movie is about unsupervised children acting like brats and getting into trouble. Even the sounds are irritating, either children making noises, to the helicopter pad outside the hotel that constantly had helicopters taking off and landing. Don't see this if you are looking for a feel good movie.",2017

OK, let's forget about the story, we're not talking about mainstream movie, so how about an inspiring point of view? or about building interesting characters or bonds between them? Nope. I believe this is very likely the most awful film I've ever seen. It's like someone who picks up the camera by accident and shoot a random home video clips. So boring, pointless and a completely waste of your time. (And I had never seen so many people walking out of a film like this, so I guess a lot of people feel the same way.)",2017

1,"I've walked out on two movies that I can remember. This was one of them. At this stage in my life I simply refuse to sit through a movie that has no worthwhile characters and doesn't even try to tell a story. I lasted 45 minutes before giving up. It's about a bunch of bratty kids who keep getting into trouble, and their parents who, not surprisingly, don't know how to set an example. Willem Dafoe is the only watchable character and he's not given enough to do to make him worth watching. Nothing original here. No heart. I suggest people skip this one.",2017
5,"I totally agree with reviewer amrelsherif. this is a slice of ""real"" life movie, where your heart is supposed to pour out to the little charming tyke and her life with her mother. I really don't know any parent who lets their child roam around totally without parental guidance. this is a little girl and her friends, after all. this seems like child abuse to me. nothing rings true and you don't feel compassion for the predicament these characters find themselves in. there is a lot of buzz for willem Dafoe's performance. honestly, for an actor with his ability, this could not have been much of a challenge. peace.",2017
4,"First, the good. I'm always pleased to see a movie that talks of a community less represented, and it's clear that there is a filmmakers sensibility in there somewhere, the one that shows these underdeveloped adult children living in a world not unlike the primary coloured plastic toys that the real children play with carelessly, so it deserves genuine consideration. But while there is a visual language of brightly coloured plastic toy worlds, and an endless fascination with the unhealthy fake precocity of the central child character, alongside apparently unconscious musings on the various degrees of emotional immaturity of almost all the adult characters, it doesn't add up to a story. It reads like a documentary (how fashionable) but it isn't, and as such, for my twenty bucks, I feel entitled to more care by the filmmaker.",2017

Baker's protagonist is Halley played by first-time actor Bria Vinaite who Baker discovered while flipping through her Instagram page.

4,"First episode pulls you in instantly and makes you want to know more. I only watched Jessica Jones (tried to watch defenders but too boring) of the Netflix hero shows and it seems this comes close to it. But I have to mention, even in the first episode, Netflix lays it on thick ""cracka"" this, ""white Christian"" that and all that good stuff... I hope they let off on it in future episode or this one is going in the bin with the defenders.",2017
3,"I love the idea of a Punisher show. So, we have the character, we have the premise, what we don't have is the ""punishing"". I had high hopes, but they are squashed. I've seen more violence in a Golden Girls episode where Blanche flirts with another roommate's boyfriend.",2017
1,"I watched the first episode and I thought the rest of the series would be great. I was wrong. This is probably one of the most boring series I have ever watched. It's slow and the action occurs infrequently. Honestly, I don't even know what the plot is. Frank Castle saves a guy from a cement mixer and then all of sudden he's being chased by a disgraced NSA hacker. I'm on episode 9 and I still don't know what the point of the series is.",2017
4,"This series was actually an fairly exciting, and at times surprisingly poignant story about the people who get a raw deal from the operations of clandestine national security operations and the military industrial complex at large. It does clearly carry a somewhat glorified agenda of both military service, and of the politics surrounding things like gun control, which may irk viewers who find themselves on a different part of the political spectrum.",2017
5,"""The Punisher"" has potential but moves far too slow for what it is trying to do. The first half of S1 could probably be condensed down into two episodes. Far too much time is waste on frivolous side plots and scenes that contribute nothing to the overall story. This would be excusable if those scenes led to any sort of character development, but as with most Marvel entertainment, the characters are paper thin (which is fine since it operates in the superhero genre).",2017
2,"This is not the Punisher from Dare Devil that I was expecting. So far this series has been such a huge disappointment (5 episodes in). I am struggling to get through the series which focuses on supporting characters and the emotional fragility of Frank Castle. The Punisher is very limited and vulnerable both physically and mentally, a far cry from the character depicted in the comics. This series could easily just be a action/drama about a Marine who suffers from PTSD. I fell asleep three times in the last two episodes.",2017
6,Started watching it but had to stop. It was just not that good. I spent too much time being bored and waiting for the punisher to dole out some punishment. Too much focus was spent on the cop and her partner. They need to cut the subplots which seems to be a recurring problem with these Netflix/Marvel shows. I will finish it eventually but not worth binge watching.,2017

4,"So the first couple of episodes start off with some action, but it isn't long before the storyline gets sucked up with telling a story and completely neglecting any action. So far with the Marvelflix superhero's (and I use the word ""superhero's"" very very loosely) only season 1 of Daredevil delivered in both story and action. I could forgive the casting of Joe Bernthal as the Punisher if the storyline was pumped full of action and exciting, but it isn't! The Punisher is a strategic thinking, gun-toting, unstoppable one man war-machine. who's tall, strong, and athletic.. nothing like Bernthal or the character we're getting! This is so frustrating that they can never get the simple things right.. why choose an actor who doesn't resemble the character.. and then worst of all blow the budget on a non-action melodrama, masquerading as a super-hero series. It's not as if it requires any SFX, he doesn't fly, shoot laser-beams or throw cars. Sorry Marvelflix but you've let me down again, BIG time!",2017
4,"I don't get the raving about the acting. Jon Bernthal doesn't do much for me in this role. I could not stand seeing the stupid and completely annoying flashbacks of his lame wife in almost every episode. This is really violent, very unrealistic (I get this is based on a comic but seriously no one can sustain the levels of beatings/abuse) and tedious. There is a lot of bashing the NRA, making soldiers look unbalanced and the military corrupt. And overall they did in 13 episodes what could have been done in half the episodes just repeating the same match ups on a new day. People get shot in the head and wake up fine, everyone gets beaten senseless several times with minimal down time. Relationships really aren't developed or sensical. You know how it is going to end up so it is really just a matter of putting in the time to get there. Sad what people think is great TV today.",2017

Iron Fist was a disappointment , but after seeing Punisher in Daredevil , and having seen the movie , I was very excited to watch this. So I turned it on on a day when I had a lot of spare time , just so that I can watch at least two episodes and enjoy it ... and it was just a huge disappointment. It doesn't get you involved as much as the others . And the story is kind of crappy. I didn't even watch 2 episodes that day. I kept playing it throughout the next few days , while I was at the house doing chores , just as a background , but it's so bland that it just doesn't keep your attention . You just feel like you could be doing something else , instead of watching it. I don't even know what episode I am on now , i don't care , I probably will see the whole thing eventually, but who knows when . I saw the whole season of trailer park boys though .. that was pretty damn good, especially compared to the Punisher.",2017

8,"This is probably the most gore-fest TV series I have seen from Marvel and I am so happy that they didn't try to PG-rate anything. This is how violent I expected the Punisher to be and that is what I love about this series. Punisher has never been the hero, he is always been a character that justifies killing the bad guys instead of bringing them to incompetent justice. You also bound to agree with him because of how brutally his family was taken away from him. Jon Bernthal is the best guy to portray the anger, violence and turbulence that runs inside Frank Castle. He gives such an incredible and convincing performance that it never feels like him killing the bad guys is not justified (his version of justice). David Lieberman also felt someone who was grounding Frank the whole series and his arc also played well in keeping Frank reminded of what it feels to have a friend and family. The villains are not as fleshed out as what I expected after Daredevil (Wilson Fisk) and Jessica Jones (Killgrave) and that felt a little on the nose and predictable. There were no surprises as to who would be the bad guys. All-in-all, I think after the miss that Iron Fist was, The Punisher is a solid entry and I am happy that it has all the violence and doesn't shy away from the bloodshed that Punisher is always surrounded by and I mean it when I say that there is a lot of blood. Watch this if you are aware of the anti-hero and also if you love Jon Bernthal as he completely shines in this series.",2017
9,"Much like most people watching this series now, I was excited to watch this after the Punisher's appearance on Daredevil. Watching this now, however, it is clear that The Punisher does not shy away from some very real and disturbing topics, Post- Traumatic Stress being one of the more universal topics of the series as it focuses on veterans of modern wars. Almost every storyline in this series is rationalized as a result of the US government letting down its citizens, both veteran and civilian.",2017

It stands on its own to become an award winning series for 10 seasons easy.Its that good.The intense feeling you get from watching Bernthal act through this raises my heartrate in response to what hes going through, he is that powerful of an actor. I feel what he is feeling in every scene. The pain and struggle he constantly fights to overcome to become what he knows he should be is outstanding to watch. Netflix scored high with this one, and Jon i hope you get a raise for next season bro, you deserve it.Great Job",2017

7,"I'm a die hard fan of Alexander Payne I've been waiting for Downsizing with childish anticipation. The first few minutes of the film I felt at home. Matt Damon's wardrobe alone told me I was in male Payne territory. Matthew Broderick in Election, Paul Giamatti in Sideways - ordinary to the point of being invisible and then, the downsizing, No idea where the story goes from here and neither does Mr. Payne. There is something of John Frankenheimer's Seconds, although, clearly, that's not Downsizing's intention. No, what is Downsizing about? I never ask myself that questions because I usually don't have to, but I have to now. I have no idea if it was an an allegorical piece too clever for me or was it that the great Alexander Payne was venturing into virgin territory with one of his old invisible characters as a guide. Without having everything quite figured out. Hong Chau is lovely but was she suppose to be comic relief, tears and all? I couldn't tell and yet, I was transported and intrigued and at a certain point I was moved even if, I couldn't quite believe in the whole thing. So, go, at your own peril.",2017
6,"From Sideways, to Nebraska, to The Descendants, and even Paris, je t'aime, I've pretty much loved everything that I've seen from director Alexander Payne, making Downsizing one of my most anticipated films of 2017. Having heard so little about the film aside from its concept, I went into the screening fairly cold. Sadly, the film doesn't have a whole lot more to offer than its brilliant concept and exceptional first act. I must admit that I left feeling disappointed, thinking they could've made this a better movie in many ways. When a film has so much promise and doesn't exactly deliver on much of it, I feel as though many people would be let down by that. Here is why I believe everyone should see Downsizing, despite it being slightly too mediocre as a final product.",2017
3,"If you came to see this movie because of the trailer or because of curiosity of what a world would be like if you were 5 inches instead of 6 feet, then you paid for about 45 minutes. The other hour and a half is a completely different movie that has minimal to do with downsizing and is not what the trailer suggests.",2017
9,"If you're expecting a goofball, raunchy comedy, this isn't it, hence some of the bad reviews. This movie was more mature than the trailers lead on, but there is plenty of well-timed comedy, intertwined with a drama that is deep and emotional. It's the story of an underachieving man's journey from a unsatisfied life, seeking change for the wrong reasons, only to unexpectedly find true purpose and love in process. If that's a plot that peaks your interest, than this movie delivers. The leading Vietnamese lady love interest steals the show! If you're a grown up, with a developed taste for script over cheap vulgar laughs and attention span to appreciate a heart warmer, this is worth your money.",2018
8,"After watching this film and then seeing the low rating for it I was really surprised, did I see the same movie ? this could have been a silly film about being small in a big world a bad borrowers concept maybe? I saw an interesting and emotional drama about an under achieved man , Paul (Matt Damon) looking for a better life, he is betrayed by the one person he wanted an improved life with. There is a message about mankind here too , our planet is overpopulated and we need to find a solution, the downsizing concept actually makes a lot of sense. As usual in the real world good ideas can be abused in the wrong hands or turned against humanity. Big or small there will always be a class system, winners and losers . Ok the film is far from perfect and loses its way a bit in the second half with the under explored imminent catastrophe angle. The quirkiness highlights come in the Vietnamese girl , Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chou) who takes over Pauls disappointing new life and his neighbour Dusan (Christoph Waltz) who adds a new spark, together they give Paul new purpose, a chance to make up for unfulfilled aspirations, at the end of the day what do we all want out of life ?",2018
5,"First off, let me say this right off the bat: If you're going into this, because you were enticed by the trailers just like I was, let me save you a little bit of time. If you've seen the trailers, you've seen the whole movie. I am not joking. There is one, seemingly hidden thread that ties all this schlock together, and that's not until the end of the film. From there, you are walking out of the theatre, wondering what the hell you have just watched. For me, this was beyond disappointing. I actually walked away from the theatre, feeling wrong for merely existing! So rest assured, if anything exists in this film, it has the emotional factor. I'll give it that! It also has heart. Unfortunately, what it does not have, is SUBSTANCE! Not enough, little too none, material to justify this being a movie, much less a film running close to damn near two and a half hours! The first 20 minutes was good, I was intrigued, I was even smiling. It brought a feel good, round and about, pleasant atmosphere to it all. From the half hour mark, I was struggling to keep myself awake. 45 minutes in, I was literally seeing two screens, two Matt Damons....Christ, this is putting me to sleep, but I may as well see how all this ends. And the ending? Forget it! Downsized is a thinking movie, but its as if they want you to view it from their point of view, not your own. Hey, I can think for myself, and walking away from this just gave me 100's of more questions that need to be answered. Downsized is a mess. It's got no direction, story goes nowhere, its clearly unbalanced, and it tries way too hard to justify itself with its preachy nonsense. Yes! Plot is traded in for a whole lot of talking. You ready? I wasn't, either. Bottom line: Pass it up! I can think to myself too...this is Honey I Shrunk The Kids for adults. Speaking of which, I can ask myself just as many questions about this movie, as I can about that one: Why wasn't the dad arrested on child endangerment charges, for being a dumb ball? 4.3 stars, but since I am such a great guy, I'll round it to 5. And if anything needs downsizing, it's all these lame, dumb movies being released.",2017

I never like to watch trailers for films because I find they set an unreasonable expectation for what the viewer is told to think the film should be about, and when that expectation isn't met, people are rightfully disappointed. So I never watch trailers. Having said that, this is a film not without flaws. Ultimately though, the story is unique, intriguing, and definitely weird. If you are the type of person who likes weird, you'll probably dig this film. If you're the kind of person who prefers predictability and by-the-numbers painting, this film will definitely get on your nerves. ",2018
5,"After seeing the trailer and prior to that not knowing a thing about this movie, I took the wife last night. I loved the concept and saw many funny people (Kristin Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, among others) in the trailer and thought it would be fun. While I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, it was SLOW and really didn't provide many laughs. Seemed to be another movie trying to push down an agenda regarding global warming and conservation rather than being a fun escape for 2 hours. If you like the actors, you might like the movie, but if you're expecting something with a comedic slant, I'd say you'll be disappointed.",2017

The trailers looked entertaining and Jason Sudeikis and Kristen Wiig are comedy heavyweights, so I figured ""hey, shrink down some people and commence with hilarity and comedy hijinx"". WRONG. Both actors combined have about 10-15 minutes of screen time. The movie started out promising, but then it started to get strange and preachy. After the credits rolled, my wife and I just sort of stared at each other for an awkward amount of time waiting to see who would blame who for picking this movie. The conspiracy theorist in me is concerned that I was baited with a fun comedy movie then switched into a global warming nonsense hit piece.",2017

Nothing would be different."" It makes fun of progressive ideas and offers a defeatist outlook: The best we can do for the world is give poor neighbors our leftovers and await our doom. Our protagonist is a bumbler who lacks agency. Bossy, dissatisfied women prod him into action for better or worse. Misogynist, anti-science and racist undertones. Unimaginative plot nonsense.

With so many strong, media-hyped and highly anticipated films coming out in the 2017 holiday/end-of-the-year season I feel cheated that I chose to see Downsizing over other contenders. I thought the premise was fresh and imaginative but then, less than half-way through the movie, the whole story line took took a sharp turn. The 'charm' disappeared and the characters, along with the plot, seemed to sail off in an uncharted direction. (Before the movie ended I was already thinking of the recent 'disastrous' fate of the film MOTHER!) The whole literal downsizing idea had so much more potential than to be turned into another Hollywood message film to the audience.",2017
8,"I use to love Alexander Payne's movies (maybe except by About Schmidt), mainly because they are acid in their critics or because they are touching, but what is common to all of them is the great sense of humor. In this movie, Payne goes back to to the social satire that worked so well on his earlier movies (mainly in Election), but here, he expands the scope of his criticism from the American way of life to environment, passing through immigration, consumerism, among other themes. ",2017
4,"What is the American dream? For a lot of people, it's simply to be wealthy for the sake of their family. But as we're further influenced by the media, the definition of wealthy becomes skewed. What should be a simple dream to be sure that your family is never too worried about money, suddenly becomes bigger with fantasies of mansions and private jets. There's nothing wrong with dreaming big as people are free to do what they wish with their earnings. But consider how a lot of lottery winners lose their wealth; they'll go out and buy everything they've ever wanted, but never dig into their own personal problems that have prevented them from becoming rich in the first place. It's all design, but no substance. ",2017
1,"The trailer makes it appear to be a quirky comedy and tiny people who have been downsized, but it is not. The first 30 minutes or so where they focus on the actual downsizing and what comes with that are good, but then it soon forgets this concept completely and veers off into several nonsensical other plots. Matt Damon was incredible boring. The other acting was fine, but the movie was terrible. Save yourself the money. Such a great concept, and they screwed it up. So disappointing.",2018
3,"I just watched two bad movies seamed together at around the half hour mark. The ""Down Sizing"" movie we all saw in the trailers ended around 30 minutes into the film; it would have been nice to see where that story could have gone. I think Matt and Kristin could have made a funny film together if it stuck to what the trailers were eluding too. The second story-line, starting about half an hour in, had no relevance to the characters being small. Instead, it jumped from Matt's experimentation with drugs to Global Warming so fast that I found myself in shock that I'm suddenly watching a feature with absolutely no plot. When the end finally did come, the final scene was as empty as the entire movie.",2017
5,"My daughter wanted to see this movie, and needless to say, I was pretty unenthused. Our track record at the cinema in 2017 has been dismal. Time and time again, every big-budget, star-packed, hyper-promoted Hollywood offering has left me wishing I stayed home to watch Netflix. When I saw the running time of 2:15, I was extremely reluctant to endure this movie.",2017
1,I feel like I just got trolled.,2018
8,"This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen in years. Director Alexander Payne and writer Jim Taylor have taken something so straightforward with the idea of shrinking and brought a thought provoking and satirical spin to it. This film tackles political ideas you wouldn't expect like the environment, immigration and the class system. In the near future, Norwegian scientists have figured out a solution to help the planet sustain itself from overpopulation. The answer: Literally make the population smaller. Years after the process called Downsizing became available to the public, people have been getting themselves shrunk and living the tiny communities built for them. Here Payne and Taylor use this concept to explore the economic and political ramifications as the people and governments abuse the technology to avoid the world's problems rather then taking a part to fix it. Average middle-class citizens are getting themselves shrunk not to help the environment but rather as an excuse to live like royalty in downsized communities like Leisureland since their credit will be worth way more at 5-inches tall. As news report talk about the fear of shrunken terrorists sneaking past borders, governments in other countries use downsizing to oppress the people by shrinking human right groups so their voices will go unheard.",2017
2,"Imagine the challenge a movie publicist must face when given the task of promoting a motion picture that preaches social orthodoxy, that presents a dystopic present-day condition as reality, and leaves the audience to depart the cinema depressed over the state of humankind. A truthful description of such a film is box office poison. A false image must be cultivated in the minds of prospective movie-goers. If it's The Cider House Rules, you sell it as the inspiring story of a young doctor who devotes his life to care for underprivileged orphans. If it's Downsizing, you film a trailer that depicts it as a light comedy about yuppies making the decision to shrink their bodies to 5 inches in order to enjoy a better life. Your task is to sell tickets; your responsibility has ended there. You don't have to make the audience actually enjoy the movie. The publicity team including Kate Cavendish, Jill R. Fox, Lon Haber, and Lisa Shamata excelled in this task. ",2017
1,This film was a political bait and switch if I have ever seen one.,2018
1,"If the environment... or rather, The Environment is so important - and is right at the tipping point for the world's demise... why does Alexander Payne's DOWNSIZING spend so much time and money on trailers and commercials misleading audiences that it's a fun and frolicking science-fiction comedy starring Matt Damon and Kristin Wiig (the latter who's hardly in the picture at all)...",2017
10,"I can't agree with the reviewer before me. They are not trying to copy Stranger Things, and I don't want to go into 'copying' at all - because Stranger Things has parallels to a few games, movies and books that have been popular before it was even in the making.",2017
9,"The show can be rather slow and can often feel like it's going to take the approach of lost leaving questions unanswered, but it does all lead somewhere and it's an intriguing time travel thriller/mystery with some amazing performances. The show drags at times but the script and the actors more than make up for it. ",2018
9,"It's easy to recognize the parallels between ""Stranger Things"" and ""Dark"". Sure there are some: the disappearance of a little boy, 80's influences, dark soundtracks. But in many ways it does the opposite of what ""Stranger Things"" does. It doesn't work with likable characters. Nostalgia is not something you will find here. It's just a deep dark show, which has much to offer to people who love psychological horror, without the gory parts. This show is not for everyone. I think the best comparison to make is with ""Twin Peaks"". A show that leaves you behind every episode with a big what-the-f*ck feeling. The constant eerie feeling, as if someone is constantly playing with your thoughts. My god the creators do everything so right. It has been a long time since I have seen something so original, and executed so well.",2017
10,I don't know why a lot of people say this the German answer of stranger things. I can say it isn't! This series is absolutely great and has your own mysterious history. I hope Netflix approve a second season. I can say very very good stuff! Also many questions about all this time travels are not be answered.,2017
10,"This is a Netflix series, and like most users who liked it, I binge watched it. Usually, I don't like slow pacing series (hated last Twin Peaks series), but this one kept me on the edge of my seat. Slowly unfolding, there is a feel of recent Scandi noir series about it. If at all possible, watch it with German audio and subtitles. I feel dubbing made acting seem bad. This is a mystery, sci-fi, drama and many other things with incredible characters that seem incredibly real - writing is superb. Casting is unbelievable - we are seeing characters when they were children and later when they grow up. There is an uncanny resemblance.",2017
10,"This is fresh, innovative and just damn cool. The acting is effortless, the characters gather depth with each episode. The complexity of the story is like peeling the proverbial onion, layer upon layer. This is a story worth telling. Am looking forward to seeing what the world looks like in the series two, am sure it will bring further surprises.",2017
10,"THIS is the best fking tv show I've seen since true detective's first season. I can't believe how good it is. Beautiful photography, scenarios, costumes, thrilling atmospheric music (gives the chills!!), amazing performances and above everything: perfect beautifully (wunderbar!) storyline. ",2017
9,"I've seen the first trailer of Dark around 9 months ago and my initial response was ""Hey this looks like German Stranger Thigns"". My initial response of the first episode was ""Hey this still looks like German Stranger Things"". Why? It has the same elements the ST has. A small town, people with problems, some kids that go to woods and the chain of weird events start. A government run facility that's plotting something. Even the setting of the village reminded me so much of ST. ",2017
9,So.. where to begin?,2017
10,"Start to end the opening-credits, BGM, soundtracks, environment- setting, story, characters, sci-fi elements everything is f*ing great especially the cinematography.",2017
10,"I felt like I needed to clarify that this series is nothing like ""Stranger Things"". It is a series about time travel and it is very similar to the movie ""Predestination"", so if you liked that movie and you like dark and twisted family drama, you will really enjoy this series. It is a bit hard to follow at first because there are so many characters connected through space and time. I saw it in German and in English and I have to say, watching it in English really took a lot away from the experience, so watch it in German if you can!",2017
8,"""DARK"" is one of the best thriller I ever watched.It has everything that a thriller movie or series can give you and keeps you edge of seat.its just so dumb that people are comparing it to ""stranger things"" but it's not. Because of the flickering lights , missing children and people in the same town with secrets you can't say that it's another stranger things.",2017
10,THIS IS GREAT,2017
9,"An isolated town dominated visually and economically by the local nuclear reactor. Mysterious caves that hold strange secrets. A set of characters that have intertwined and emotionally charged relationships which stretch backward (and maybe forward?) in time. Crank up the heavy electronic score, keep the lights low with leaden skies and endless rain, and get ready for some dialog that would never work in spoken English but sounds just great in German. (If only ""Interstellar"" had been in German!)",2017
10,As a fan of genre shows (Mystery/SF) I was excited to finally see this coming from Germany.,2017
7,"""Dark"" is definitely not a TV show for everyone. Its' gloomy and twisted tone may confuse the average viewer, but it's a true beauty to lovers of strange and atmospheric horror. It is not the type of series that builds too much on jumpscares, terrifying things in the woods or gory deaths. It has some scenes including these - but the true horror of ""Dark"" is psychological and more complex. The cinematography and detailed composition of each shot is one of the best aspects of ""Dark"". The characters are interesting enough but are somewhat difficult to relate to. Props to the talented cast that makes these characters more emotionally relatable due to their amazing acting skills. Intended or not, ""Dark"" has a lot of parallels to Netflix' ""Stranger Things"" like the flickering lights, the disappearance of a young boy, the use of 80s nostalgia and the facility that has a lot of secrets from the town. It is a journey that has winks to ""Stranger Things"" and kind of wants a piece of the enormous success of it, but all in all is enjoyable if you're okay with the slow pacing and some psychological and scientific complexity.",2017
10,Rant/review for German show Dark - 10/10 Wow. ,2017
8,"Excellent series, sometimes confusing, best to watch all at once and you may have to rewatch a few.",2017
9,"Season one introduces a sh*t-ton of characters, the events which occurs in their hometown and how they are related to to each other.",2017
6,"... and it's German, which gives a surreal touch, at least for me who have never watched a series in German before, just a few movies. 
It's impossible not to like ""Dark"" at least a very little, since it's a mix of things everyone loves, but it really fails in so many levels.
Cinematography is excellent. The music is kind of repetitive and uses lots of synth sounds: it works for some particular moments, but is unnecessary most of the times. The acting is irregular: there are truly a lot of characters and actors, so some of them I think were fine, but mostly it's not very good I must say. 
And the most important thing: the plot. It has some nice twists (not great) in the first few episodes, but at some point it starts to fail in epic proportions. If you have not watched many time-travel movies or haven't watched some who deal with wormholes (for example, Donnie Darko), maybe you find it interesting. But if you've seen all that, then this will give you absolutely nothing: it all goes around a clichÃ©d idea that is not profound by any means and doesn't make a lot of sense.
The back to the futurish thing is fun to watch: even some plot lines take place in the 50's and in the 80's, which really takes you all the way to Marty Mcfly and the Doc, but the way it's done is not intelligent enough to make any sense.
And the soap opera plot lines, such as romance and deceptions between the characters are completely unnecessary and anti-climax.
I've finished the whole series, so I guess it works at some level. Maybe taking bits of sci-fi movies and concepts we all love and then mix it into a German series was a genius idea, since it is kind of addictive and seems to be doing well. But I feel really guilty about having invested almost 10 hours of my week into this, because my mind tells me that it was absolutely not worth it.",2017
10,"Reading reviews here, people don't seem to know they often can switch the audio they are hearing: to the original language or the dubbed version. You don't have to watch it in the English language, you can change it to the original German language.",2017
10,The first season delivered to us is great. to the guy before me that only cares about how much he spent on his TV you should really write the manufacture and never ever in you're life write a review on any type of media displayed on your self proclaimed special snowflake screen.,2017
5,"The show wants to be a serious mystery. It want's to be grim. There is a constant synth sound in nearly every scene foreshadowing grim things are coming, even on the most banal scenes.",2017
9,The similarities with Stranger things are there but these series have much more in common with Steins;Gate.,2017
3,"Its obvious to see what the show is aiming for; in it's acting, in the family interactions, and in the plot. But it is So HEAVY HANDED. From the get-go we are bombarded with over loud, crass synth soundtrack. In every scene someone is over emoting, breaking down, running through the streets screaming. We are to believe that there is love and tenderness between characters, but none of this is shown; we are not made to feel it. And there are huge holes in the plot and in behavior patterns of the police. No police force in the smallest village is this inept and unprofessional. Certain plot twists are laughable, but since I haven't checked the spoiler box I will not name them.",2017

1,"This movie is so awful, that it is hard to find words to describe it. I really can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing to go and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of the idea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It is bad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible and without any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the final the story is badly written.",2017
1,"I saw it and yeah...I had fun, laughing I guess? For anyone who tells me that its a beautiful, love story...f*ck off. It was the cheesiest, corniest, most awkward-comedic film. But hey, it worked for a great comedy where the jokes on the film. Seriously, the scenes were so bad you couldn't help but laugh. I think FSoG was better in the aspect to take it a bit more ""serious"" than FSD. This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqué intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish?",2017
1,"Storyline: 0/10 I don't really see any up or down in the story-line. It's only sex and sex and nonsense stuff. I meant ""stuff"" because there's nothing to describe. Honestly, people come to watch the movie because of the sex scene only, and it is even worse than the 1st part. Lesson: if you're rich, you get everything, even a sex slave. That is literally everything from the movie. I rarely say a movie is bad, but this movie is so bad that I even hate it. I regret my $10 and 120minutes watching a bunch of BS like this.",2017
1,"While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her. There was at least a 5% inside my brain that hoped to find something good in this whole mess or at least for this movie to be a bit decent, unfortunately this is one of the worst films of 2017 at least so far with some of the most boring sex scenes i have ever seen, awful dialogue and really weird sense of humor and the 2 main stars had an on/off kind of chemistry plus that helicopter sequence looked a bit decent in the trailer so i won't lie on that but in the actual movie it was painful to sit threw. This movie uses lines such as ""Kinky F*ckery"" and thinks that it's funny or smart but it's not it's funny in a very different kind of way. Overall at the end of the day this 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sequel was even worse than the original with horrible acting, plot and characters that are abusive and creepy as hell and i'm still wondering how Kim Basinger went from Batman and L.A Confidential to 'Fifty Shades Darker' but hey look at the good side of things this Franchise is so bad that we can make fun of it every day but if you did liked the first film you will probably like this one as well but for everyone else? STAY AWAY!!! (0/10)",2017
1,"If you are a basic looking chick looking a movie about a rich, hot dude dating a plain chick, then this the movie for you.It doesn't matter whether he is a psychopath, controlling, possessive, dating you because you remind him of his dead mother, and gets off on abusing you. As long as he is rich and good looking, then it's worth it to you and you will enjoy this movie. This movie is designed for you. There is nothing special or interesting about these characters or the one dimensional background cast. You're watching them date for an hour and a half with an vanilla sex scene for every ten to fifteen minutes of talking. There is no conflict or problems in this movie. All the scenes of potential conflicts of the trailer are resolved within minutes after they happen. Anastasia has no backbone in this movie. She gripes and complains about not doing what he wants, then go ahead and do whatever he wants anyway.So if you want to see a movie about Anastasia and Christian date for two hours and have sex, then this is the movie for you.Pros: I liked the first movie because it was so bad it was funny and the soundtrack was good. This movie is literally the two of them getting back together and dating and the soundtrack was okay.",2017

And for the dudes that go watch this..there are so many porn sites that a free and you don't have to sit through hours of bad dialogue for a 15 min soft porn scene. The only reason they keep making these films is because idiots keep buying tickets to go watch this movie. Horrible ratings and people still stand by and defend it. Stop giving a movie high ratings because it increases your hormone levels you horny animals lol,2017
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This is the worse film I've ever seen, the original is the second worse. It's a 2 hour bore fest where nothing happens. This film is full of random sex scenes with no reason of being there. This could only appeal to women who want to see something they would find arousing. The plot can be summarized in a few line, which i won't do to make this spoiler free. If you have any appreciation for films avoid! Do not support this disgusting attempt to be an entertaining piece of fiction!",2017
1,"Wow what a disappointment !! I personally loved the books ,i saw the back story behind all the sex of a broken man finding and learning to love really beautiful. The movie , well there are so many things wrong with it starting with the cinematography ,it's just all too perfect Hollywood and not enough rawness and realness to it and i hate it .Next is the cast i mean i love Jamie Dornan and Dakota is OK but they were so not right for this movie!No chemistry or heat between them and very wooden analytical acting.Jamie Dornan in The Fall was awesome by the way i am not a hater.Other cast also was wrong from Elana to Mia and so on.The movie also seems very rushed ,I know it is an adaptation of the book but not done smoothly in my opinion , It makes me really sad as these movies could have been great if only they had gotten it right ,Take a page out of ""Nick Cassavetes"" book because he directed The Notebook perfectly.",2017

Thats what we will know right now ,firstly it was way way way worst than the 1st one,i wanted to see it at the cinema cause it could be deleted version but in did see it both cinema and leaked version so i said why not specially the director i love his movies so i had some hopes that they could learn from the mistakes but they made it worst the acting was way way way worst even Dakota Johnson she looks great Jarmie Dornan is right in loving her but she was worst than the first one although Grey's pleasures or his bad way in treating her was not harsh as the first one but still his acting was like a falsehood acting even the soundtrack that the first one was perfect at,this one's music was bad only countable songs were good even the sex scenes itself one in the beginnings of the movie wasn't made right but the rest were realistic again because they edited some music its not NC-17 if it was NC17 movie i would've said its great one but no, i just liked the chemistry between them but porn watchers will say its a good one but I'm not a porn watcher I'm saying its a guilty pleasure cause its laughably bad it is good and i could enjoy it without making it a good one again another shitty soft core porn feature film my rating is its not horseshit its triple horseshit or horseshit to the power of 10😂 that's why my score is 1/10",2017
1,"My God, Where to begin? this movie was awful in so many ways that make a list would be such a waste of time. Anyway, I can mention the most prominent and substantial to me, starting by the most elementary piece which is the idea behind the whole story, in other words the subtext or message that the film delivers. This is no other thing but a teenager wet dream, founded on the most shameless shallowness and superficiality: Is the story of a naive young girl obsessed with the actual prototype of perfect spouse in every aspect important for the society, millionaire, handsome, fit, hard-sex addict, possessive and tough guy, so tough that he even resists an helicopter crash to come back without a scratch; so basically what the movie tries to unfold it's an attempt to tell a story where this girl keeps striving to catch this guy and engage him into a ""serious relationship"" without all of his flaws and addictions, in this process all of his evil ex's and spooky characters of his past will try to stop her in such predictable manners that you will have to throw some popcorn to others in theater to get amused if possible.

1,"Frankly, do you call this a movie or soft porn that promotes male domination and humiliates women? Wasted my money and time by watching this movie just because some of my friends wanted to watch it badly. This movie just pollutes the minds of our younger generation. Everything from dialogues, sex scenes and acting is poor. The music was a bit good for which I gave one star. Honestly we women are not like this. We also like to have good, clean and natural relationships in our life. We don't always want to get wet and indulge in a submissive relationship. Fifty shades of grey started it and now this title made it worst further. Please come up with some good story-line. Thumbs down. It only frustrated me and nothing else.",2017
1,This was a terrible movie. Extremely boring and senseless. Do not waste your time to watch this garbage. Not even romantic. Even the sex was very stupid and dull. Even the acting was really terrible. The story line is very stupid. The only good thing about the movie is Seattle scenery. Reminds me of San Francisco.,2017

2,"Before I start going reviewing this one: I didn't watched the first one because of the enormous negative critiques and the fact that it sheds the wrong light on real BDSM practices. So the second one I watched, but only because my SO insisted to watch it with me. She read the book and everything and summarized the story of the first one in 15! seconds.",2017
1,"This movie really sucked. I was expecting it to be like the first one but I really did not expect it to be this convoluted, illogical and nonsensical. Fifty Shades of Grey should not be so financially successful, the fact that the first one made so much money really upsets me. I hated the over arching plots that did not tie into the 'story' at all and were REALLY forced into the 'story', but really there was no story, or no real reason to want to invest your time into these 'characters'. I hate movies like this that claim to be so R-rated but really are just a very extreme 15+. It became a comedy rather than a dramatic romance film because of its terrible writing, stale performances and overall confusing 'plot' that made no sense and really did not need to exist. This movie is a 1/10 because it is incredibly annoying and really did not need to be made.",2017
2,"Well ..... (if you haven't yet seen it but intend to, best to look away now). Might I say that the romance between Jack & Rose, in ""Titanic"" (1997), was FAR MORE CAPTIVATING, than this 2nd installment of the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise. According to an IMDb peer reviewer, this movie actually went nowhere. ""This movie is awful, yes, that's the best way to describe this movie. Acting, terrible, the story does not make sense. It's just about sex, and a bad, really poorly written script"" (you're better of just watching reruns of soap operas, such as the ""The Bold & the Beautiful (1987-)""/ ""Days of our lives"" (1965-), or even ""Passions"" (1999-2007) for free on the telly. ""The soundtrack stood out, and the cinematography is decent. But once again, its a film baiting TEENAGE GIRLS, to go watch (soft porn) in the movie theater (a second time around""). Its just a shame that the lead couple (Dakota Johnson, ""Anastasia Steele"", and Jamie Dornan, ""Christian Grey"") were handed such a boring script (I'm looking at you, Mr Niall Leonard. I don't care if you're married to the author of the books). No character development. And a really dull plot. No twists. No suspense. Viewers have had better sex elsewhere. Finally, KIM BASINGER: HOW DARE SHE BE CAST IN SUCH A TERRIBLE ROLE !! She was Hollywood's DARLING of the 1980s/1990s !! Batman's box office love interest !! I don't care how much she's aged !! Quite disrespectful, in casting her as an ""undesirable"" (same deal with Bella Heathcote - just so terribly underused). Instead of providing a rating, I'll propose a more appropriate title: ""FIFTY SHADES 2: THE VIRTUE, OR IGNORANCE OF RICH PEOPLE AGONIZING OVER LIPSTICK MARKS ON THEIR CHEST"". Plus the film would've worked (much, much better) as a comedy. Think Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" (2006). I'm actually not joking about this. P.S: Thank you to my mate Chris for coming to watch this travesty with me. We survived it, bro. High Five.",2017

6,"I grew up watching the Justice League animated series and I enjoyed every DCEU movie so far, so I was really excited to finally see these heroes together for the first time on the big screen. Unfortunately, the movie was a letdown. It's not bad by any means, but it was not as epic as it should have been. Here are my pros and cons:",2017
4,"Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" is nothing more than another poorly made movie in a franchise that's practically been dead since its second film. While not as horrible, ""Justice League"" still is not good. The most redeeming factor of the film is some of its characters, but that isn't enough to pull this series out of the hole its in. On the plus side, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman still shines, even after her wonderfully made standalone film, and may be the best character in the film. Jason Mamoa's Aquaman is a lot of fun, with great humor to go alongside him. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is also an interesting and fun character, being equally as good as Momoa, maybe even slightly better. Unfortunately, Ezra Miller's Flash does not blend with the darkness of every other character, some saying that is the point, but he is almost too far gone to blend in any way. Then, Affleck's Batman is a dry, dull, ill-humored, useless character, and Henry Cavill still broods too much to be fun, and is a somewhat useless addition. The villain of the film is nonthreatening, boring, and plot less, and could be the worst part of the entire film, next to the cliché and boring plot that has been seen in every Avenger's movie to this day, and believe me, I hate having to make that comparison. ""Justice League is moderately fun, but still can't redeem this helpless series.",2017
5,"Justice League felt like going through a list of specifications with no identity whatsoever. It's not a bad movie per se, it's just extremely dull. Of course there's nothing new in the photo department but that's to be expected, it's kind of an identity for the whole DCEU. I don't like it but hey, that's an artistic choice I won't criticize here, at least it's coherent. But some flaws are more crippling than that. ",2017
3,I saw the Film last night and i have not an answer for what they need an budget of 300.000.000 USD. Ugly low-detail locations and semi effects. And this is the end of the world? Roland Emmerich would cry for this crap.,2017
4,In short:,2017
6,"The film was okay. Definitely not bad. How I wish Warner Brothers experimented with more standalone films before they finally got to Justice League. As a big DC fan, I was a bit let down. 2hours was definitely not enough to put this film's story across. There were great plot points but everything just seemed to go by too quickly. Henry Cavill's CGI upper lip was very distracting, and his superman- even though I really liked him- but he was just too powerful for Steppenwolf, or maybe Steppenwolf was the one who was too weak for the story they were going for. For someone who wanted to destroy the world, I think he wasn't menacing enough. Ray Fisher was great as Cyborg, I liked Gal Gaddot as Wonder Woman, Mamoa as Aquaman, and even Miller as the flash. But I didn't like how the flash runs in this movie....his legs move in a weird way. Batfleck owned his role obviously. There were great moments in the film, especially when Superman returns and meets the team for the first time. Loved his reunion with Louise and his Mom, and I'm really looking forward to where this universe will go.",2017
6,"The long anticipated ""Justice League"" has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.",2017
1,"Everyone knows by now that due to unfortunate circumstances, Zack Snyder (Director) and his wife, Deborah Snyder (Producer) had to leave the project for personal reasons, which enticed to the studio (Warner Bros.) to bring in 'Avengers' director Joss Whedon and ''finish'' it. ",2017
4,"As we all know, Zack Snyder (BvS) has a very different vision of superhero movies than Joss Whedon (Avengers). This movie felt like a mish-mash of both incompatible styles. Scenes just happen without any connectivity, the plot is so generic it could have been written by a 5-year old. The attempt by WB Studios to Marvel-ise the movie by bringing in Joss Whedon and shoe-horning in comedy elements is nauseating. Yes, Flash has his comedic moments, but they feel very out of place. Superman's jokes are just out of character for what has been established. ",2017
8,"Hey, don't go with high expectations, the movie is far away from epic, but it's pretty fine and funny, I enjoyed a lot of stuff, the characters are awesome! Even Steppenwolf isn't the lame they said, he is just not memorable, he's OK, a generic villain who delivers what everyone should expect (come on, it's Steppenwolf, why would you guys expect a mind blower villain here?) The plot is simple and works. The only fatal flaw for a huge fan of DC is the return of Superman, damn, that's was sooo weird :/ And Zimmer would be so much better than Danny was, buuut there's nothing we can do about it now, at least it's nostalgic.",2017
1,"I grew up with DC and JLA (and Superfriends). Gal Gadot is perfect and WB got Wonder Woman 'right'. But she can't save this film. it's just dull. If you are going to spend your money, go spend it on Thor Ragnarok - it's visually more impressive and has an actual plot that you can invest yourself in; Justice League's plot doesn't have any hooks to latch onto, and while we love the characters, and the cast has finally been well thought out, with the exception of Wonder Woman the costumes are still a failure and the story is all over the map making little sense and not allowing for any emotional investment in any character other than Superman - whose roll has nothing to do with the threat at hand or the history of it. Go see Thor.",2017
1,"Funny that at least half of these positive reviews were made by a week-old,fresh accounts.These ""fans"" will always get mediocre movies as long as they protect them.Anyway,this is the 4th time of DCappointment.(w.woman was good). DC has officially become MCU 2.0.DC fans are criticizing MCU movies for obvious reasons.Yet they praise J.league even though it is just like a typical marvel/MCU movie. DC has become the very thing that DC fans hate and criticized over years. Villain was so weak,flash and aquaman were cringe(especially flash),pacing was so fast. The comedy was so forced and jokes were bad placed. Some people thought that they should make flash,cyborg,aquaman solo movies before the JL in order to develop the characters.And those people were absolutely correct.Those 3 characters really lacks development. DC is still making tons of mistakes in movie industry.I think they really need to reconsider the future of dc movies.",2017

1,"The movie was complete disappointment for me. No deep content. When i was watching the movie i never fell excitement or joy. All predictable and boring. Your music also disappointed me. You come Superman alive and you did not play John Williams superman theme, that was sad. I am sorry but the movies from 40 years past are much better than this. Also what about the flash, bad actor bad role. Your low budget flash TV series even better than this. Flash and Superman were my favorite heroes sorry but you ruined them.

I had a good time with Wonder Woman but Justice League will be the deciding factor of it was one lucky shot or the beginning of correcting old faults.",2017

1,My rating of 1 does not indicate of how bad the movie quality is rather my disappoint with the ultimate result. My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.,2017
3,"Well, once again we have the generic, boilerplate, superhero team flick. Team spends the first part of the movie unable to be a team. Then they finally and miraculously get it together just in time to fight the latest unstoppable big bad, who plans to destroy the city/country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe. ",2017
2,"TL;DR: The movie is a mess: Safe but unoriginal, thin and confusing plot. Zero character development, leading to disappointing performances. Ridiculously bad CGI. Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and Superman. The most iconic super heroes in comic book and pop culture history. Should be easy to make a cool and compelling movie about them right? Eh, maybe not. Lets start with the Pros: - Ezra Miller as the Flash is entertaining at points. His comic relief at points felt forced, but some of the jokes landed. - Comic Book references; for a DC comics fan, there are cool references throughout the movie that were cool to connect to the comics and made me smile a little bit. Moving on to the neutral points: - The plot was extremely safe; however, it is also ridiculously rushed. One could say this is expected because 3 of the main characters (Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman) are appearing for the first time. The plot also is ridiculously unoriginal: Aliens are looking for artifacts. Once they find artifacts, the world will be destroyed. Team must assemble and stop them before it's too late. One could argue that this is expected too; look at the Avengers, they did that also. But the thing that the Avengers did that DC fails tremendously at is setting up each character with a backstory so the audience can feel and care about each character's motivations (except Hawkeye). The only character that is given a little bit of an emotional backstory here is the Flash, and if you have watched the TV series you know what backstory I'm talking about. In summary, the plot was incredibly unoriginal, rushed, and predictable to the very end. - Ben Affleck as Batman: Affleck fails to impress as he did in Batman v Superman; however it isn't his fault. He does the best with what he is given here, even delivering some funny one-liners. However, if anyone know Batman at all, the character written in this story is a complete 180 from both Batman v Superman and the Batman of the comics. Gone is the dark from the Dark Knight, replaced by a Batman so light, there were flashes of the post Keaton, pre Bale Batman portrayals. The fact that Danny Elfman's score also brought these memories back did not help. - Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman: Gadot suffers from the same problem as Affleck: her character is written extremely poorly. Similar to Captain America, she is a warrior from a time long gone, a time that was simpler and more heroic. Therefore, Wonder Woman should be going through the same effects that Captain America did in the Avengers: bashing with other characters who don't exemplify heroism while portraying the ideal heroic nature that she was raised with. However, her character gets demoted to sexy heroine; every shot that introduces her starts from her behind and ends at here chest area. Gadot does the best with what she's given though, and is just fine in her role as co-leader to the squad. - Danny Elfman's score: Heroic at best and fine at worst, this score is no Zimmer's Man of Steel or Wonder Woman themes. Every track here is nearly forgettable, only saved by Elfman's callbacks to his familiar Batman theme, original Superman theme, and the Wonder Woman theme. Lastly the negatives: - CGI: With a rumored 300 million dollar budget, one can only wonder how in the world can a studio mess up something that is more than 90% of the movie? Starting with the very first scene which is (spoiler) a video recording of Superman. As most know, Cavill was unwilling to shave his mustache because he was filming MI6 at the same time, so the studio had to digitally remove it. The end result is something that looked like Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Immediately bringing laughs, this scene is just a precedent for the rest of the film's horrific CGI. The villain looks like a college student digitally created him for an extra credit project, with clunky movement and not fitting in with the background at all. Cyborg is an unfortunate casualty of this as well because for the whole movie his CGI just distracts from Fisher's performance and dialogue (more on that later). Nearly every shot during battle scenes and on Themyscira look like they were animated for a commercial. - Momoa and Fisher as Aquaman and Cyborg: Similar to Batman and Wonder Woman, it looks like these characters were written with little to zero personality. However, unlike Gadot and Affleck, Momoa and Fisher are barely there, delivering their lines like they are reading them for the first time. Their characters just feel like ex machinas at points. Momoa tries a little to just be himself, which can be seen as a good thing, but doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all. - Jumping around from location to location: When Star Wars Rogue One came out, people complained that the first half hour was dizzying due to the jumps from planet to planet. In this movie, it's not planet to planet, but from city to plane to city to island to ocean to city to flashback, without any warning or location status to even prepare the audience of the scene. - Editing/Reshoots: Building on the last point, the movie itself feels off. One can definitely tell the different tones from Snyder and Whedon immediately. (Spoiler) For example, Aquaman is introduced twice, and it is extremely obvious which one was the reshoot compared to Snyder's version. It's like there were two versions of the movie, and they couldn't decide which version to release so they just grabbed and mixed scenes from both versions. The final battle as well is immediately guilty of this. - Handling of Superman: Superman was gonna come back, only a child would be surprised by this. However, this movie retcons Batman v Superman in a way that makes no sense.",2017
1,"When you think superhero films, you probably remember such hits as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers. The last thing that comes to mind is any DC movie that has come out in recent years. Many people thought that after the end of the Dark Knight Trilogy that we would see a resurgence in the DC nostalgia that made the company bigger than Marvel at one point. ",2017
8,"Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and  personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic  relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause  who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie.  Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien  mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still  amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema.  The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of  hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the  protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft,  lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a  badly made video game.  The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence  is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the  mustache to Henry Cavill.  The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is  set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3  mother boxes to take down the world.""  The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high,  they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because  of what the darkness was criticized.  The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors  between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many  of the scenes of the trailers are not here.  The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of  #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic  superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes  in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas  and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy  (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an  epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this  universe. I liked it very much.  PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good.",2017

5,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me.",2017

I see the critics post as must see, film of the year, et, etc. This was billed as a film with fantastic sound. I found the continuous droning noise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be a fantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whale noises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gun fire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid in the fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and the nonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallow lazy boring rubbish filming. If they added a decent music score it may have kept me interested. This film does not show it as it was its just absolute cap and does not come across as a powerful film at all. A waste of money.",2017

I don't like to rubbish the hard work that people put into their films because I enjoy really well made films. But in short I really wish someone told me to avoid this one. I'm not one to follow the flow and praise something that is clearly so very bad.,2017

Everything from an odd random torpedo scene to the rescued troops getting pulled into boats, soaking wet in oil/seawater then getting off in England wearing dry crisp uniforms.",2017
1,"Ever since the end of the second world war, the phrase 'Dunkirk spirit' has been used in Britain to describe courage and solidarity in times of adversity.

Where's the bravery or self sacrifice in that? Instead of identifying with this ""hero"" I became increasingly angry with him and had nothing but contempt for his actions. Why not push in front of everyone else by pretending to be a medic? Why not pretend to be a survivor from a ship that's just been bombed and sunk? Not only do you get priority access to the next rescue boat but you get a hot drink, food and warmth before your comrades left behind on the beach. I was actually happy that every escape attempt failed for this character. ",2017

1,"where to start ... WW2 ended over 70 years ago, so I thought it was the time to tell true stories about what happened back then, but I guess I was wrong, and the allies still need some sort of ego- boosters, where the Germans are portrayed as dumb with fighters made of paper. The movie is very boring and slow to be categorized under war genre, and you can see that clearly even on the faces of the actors ... 400,000 soldiers trapped on a beach, should be a movie scene that everyone will remember for years, yet all we saw were few bored soldiers standing in lines as if they were waiting for bathroom... the lines of people at movie theaters who went to watch this movie looked more crowded and alive than the 400K !! And where are all those civilians boats which everyone was talking about? I thought it was gonna be a huge fleet, yet they were no more than a dozen of them !!!! I am not gonna mention the background music as this was a disaster which needs a separate review by itself... save your time and maybe spend your money on buying any WW2 game which will be 100 times more exciting than watching this",2017
1,"Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.",2017

""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...",2017
6,"This movie is so paper thin I really can't write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British ""Thin Red Line"" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed ""master of the craft"".",2017

From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeous explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening.

1,"I am fully disappointed with that movie. Brazilian specialized press is saying that is the best movie of the year. Elio Gaspari in his papers' column said today the movie is excellent. I fully disagree. First of all it is a boring movie. I had two or three times the wish of leaving the theater. As a matter of fact, some guys did so. Second, is a quite illogical movie, regarding space and time. They mixed together time shifted events, and I just realized that reading the critics. Third is a type of horror movie in which the intention is to scare you. Why the sound is so loud? I had the impression Count Dracula would show himself up to bite some soldiers' neck. After spending and loosing 5USD with the ticket and regretting not to leave the theater before movies end, I realized that was the worst movie on WWII ever shot. I dare to say that is the worst movie ever shot about any war, not just WWII.",2017

And two actors as Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, almost not showing at all. I acknowledge Inception and Interstellar are great movies, although not 'my type', but this is not a great movie as they said.",2017

The main focus should have been on how Molly organized the games and who was involved. However, the director felt that adding Kevin Costner and Idris Elba's characters and the skiing subplot was more important than actually telling the story faithfully. There was so much detail about what went into setting up the games and they totally ignored it and actually invented other things. Like for example, I do not think the drug problem was even in the book, and if it was, it didn't mess her up that badly. It's like the actual games and the celebrities involved were an afterthought. Without the names of the celebrities involved, the story had less of an impact. They were just Hollywood C-List actors and extras. Tobey Maguire also got a total pass, they went light on him in the movie; I can't believe they didn't even include the Shufflemaster debacle and worse yet, the time he demanded she bark like a seal for a tip.",2018

The question hangs in the air very early during the film, and it's never really answered-- at least not in the 1 1/2 hours that I watched it. Yeah, I bailed.",2018
7,"'Molly's Game' is written and directed by esteemed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin of whom it is the directorial debut. It is adapted from the book of the same name by Molly Bloom herself. The film stars Jessica Chastain as the eponymous character in a commanding performance which keeps the audience hooked when the story itself fails to do so. Idris Elba plays Molly's lawyer in another good performance to add to his collection. The story is about Molly who was once an Olympic-hopeful skier who got sidelined due to injury which is shown in an engaging opening scene accompanied by her voice over. After to this she moves to LA and after a brief stint as a cocktail waitress ends up working as an assistant at a high stakes poker game featuring Hollywood stars, business moguls and unknowingly the Russian mob. When her boss refuses to pay her because she is making some much in tips she strikes out on her own and moves the game to a new location making sure to alert all the regular players of where to show up in the process. She also has a game set up in NYC and runs them both at the same time. ",2017

8,"Jessica Chastain stars as Molly Bloom, an Olympic hopeful, law student turned Poker Queen. This amazing story keeps you locked on the screen for its two and a bit hour run time. From her skiing days, childhood, current lawsuit, poker games in LA and New York, the movies goes back and forwards in good and not so confusing way and by movies end you walk out of the cinema wanting to start up your own private poker game. My Score: 8.5/10",2018
9,"You could easily read about the ending before or read Molly's book. But if you go into this movie blind, you will be gripped. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. Wonderful performances all around. For Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut, I couldn't have imagined a better movie.",2018
9,"I don't think Molly Bloom could have been cast any better than with Jessica Chastain... she nailed her role. Oddly enough, she looks similar to the actual Molly Bloom.",2018
8,"I saw this film at TIFF in Sept, and it is extremely entertaining. While Aaron Sorkin, in his directorial debut shows he still has a lot to learn about directing, his story (to no surprise) is full of life, wit, and snappy dialogue. He will undoubtedly be nominated for another Oscar this year.",2017

8,"My husband and I attended opening night and were dismayed to see that the theater was only about a third of the way full. It was mostly middle-aged couples (we're 32 and 37) at the 7:10 showing. Despite being 2 hours and 20 minutes, we were both engaged throughout the entire film. Jessica Chastain was fantastic and I thought that she played the part very well. Her depiction of Molly Bloom as both sexy and driven was spot on, as we researched the real Molly Bloom after watching the film. Michael Cera's character was somewhat of a villain, which is a far cry from the part he played in Superbad. Idris Elba and Kevin Costner both had supporting actor roles and gave the film really good depth. I liked how the film jumped back and forth between Molly's childhood and current day and current day and her venture into the underground gambling world. We watch a lot of movies, and this one did not disappoint. I really want to learn how to play poker now!",2018
8,"A movie that keeps you attentive throughout. Jessica Chastain (Molly) plays a very strong female lead in the film - does a phenomenal job. Mark my words, everyone will know her name by the next few years. Idris Elba (Charlie) is fantastic as always. The movie can be suspenseful. Great storyline with clever dialogue. If you don't already know the story of Molly Bloom, the movie keeps you wondering what happens next. For Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut, I think this movie is a hit. We should be excited to see what he does next. Definitely worth a watch.",2018
8,"The more I watch Jessica Chastain on the screen, the more I am convinced that she is the best actress working today. Her turn in the new Aaron Sorkin vehicle, MOLLY'S GAME adds to this conviction.",2018

7,"No spoilers in this review but having come away from watching this film, on my own at the local Empire Cinema on Friday 13th I would say this is a good horror film for those who are bored senseless by the endless tide of ""jump scare but not scary really"" horror films we have to endure these days.",2017
6,Just came out of an early screening of this film during Odeon's monthly 'ScreamUnseen'. ,2017
7,"2017 has been a very mixed year for horror (so far, anyway) We've had some fairly terrible movies like Rings, The Bye Bye Man and Annabelle: Creation but we've also had some unique, memorable films such as Get Out, It Comes at Night and IT. I'm still holding out for films such as Happy Death Day, Jigsaw and Creep 2 to be great but one film I didn't expect to enjoy was The Ritual. I saw the trailer before my screening of IT and it looked to be just another throwaway horror movie trying to be the next The Blair Witch Project. Thankfully, the film's trailer was just a poor attempt at showing what the film actually is like and shouldn't be used to assess the quality of the movie. The film's premise isn't entirely original, a bunch of friends decide to go hiking and to save time decide to cut through an eerie forest. This premise has been done to death in movies and even though director David Bruckner (V/H/S/) tries to set his film apart from the rest, the final product ends up feeling very cliché. Where the film does shine is with its cast of characters, the four friends on their hiking adventure which takes a sour turn for the worst. Our protagonist Luke (Rafe Spall) is the most interesting, fleshed-out character of the bunch and I was surprised to find out that the first act of the movie is centred around character development which really gave us a chance to learn about and care for these characters.",2017
8,"I don't remember ever reviewing a movie here, but I decided to come at the rescue of this movie...
I really enjoyed this movie and I go against the reviews which once more put it in the ""average around 6.0 score"" where so many other scary movies are standing.
I consider myself a horror/scary amateur and I have seen many movies of this kind, and since the last 10 years, its getting harder to find some that makes you say ""ok, this was a bit different"".... (of course there are some, but in my opinion over the large quantity, only over 20% are passing the ""not too bad"" test"").
For once, we don't have to bear some stupid teenagers partying for spring break in the forest, some people behaving so stupidly that you think ""seriously ??"", a haunted house, a possession, or a redneck hillbilly family... 
Here the movie has a lot of a ""realistic"" touch to it, the characters are normal and they could be us, normal people behaving normally in the face of danger and fear and that reinforce the attachment for the characters. Many times I wondered, ""damn, i dont know what I would have done in this situation"".
The mood is nicely growing more and more stressing and not much of the ""monster"" is shown for a long time, letting the viewer finding out slowly about the real horror happening in those woods. The change of scenery (Swedish forest) and the isolation of the characters reinforce the idea that nature in itself can be scary and that even a friendly country like Sweden can appear in another light...
The last quarter of the movie is a bit more conventional to the genre but still not falling in all the clichés. I especially raise a thumb up for the creature design and the explanation on what it is. Probably not all will approve, but I liked the way this was going and when learning what the creature really was, I wondered ""would I try to fight against that or give up ?""",2018
9,This movie is based on a best seller and features fine actors. Still it doesn't seem to have gained the buzz I expected. ,2017
6,Never read up on this so went in blind.,2017
7,"If you enjoyed films like Trollhunter, Thale etc you should get a kick from this. Four British lads on a hiking trek through Sweden to pay tribute to a departed mate who has been murdered at the start of the film in an off licence robbery. The story has a slight Blair Witch feel to the discovery of the carved runes in the trees as the group soon get lost in a forest. With most of my reviews I do not want to spoil the movie so I try to keep my comments brief and spoiler free. This film plays heavily on how damned creepy forests can be..even in daylight..and combines this with the concept of ancient nature elemental's/demons or gods...The acting is very natural which makes the group of friends feel familiar..like your own mates. I recommend this..but insist you view films the way that I do for full affect..view alone, in the dark..on a 42"" screen..sitting between stereo speakers or surround sound if you have it. That is the ONLY way to view any movie to be able to fully appreciate it. Make your viewing a ritual and you should enjoy 'The Ritual'.",2018
8,"I really liked this movie. Yes, the ending could've been better, a lot better, but it was really psychologically thrilling and spooky, especially for a Netflix movie. I'm really impressed with Netflix's content lately.",2018
8,"Based on the excellent book by Adam Nevill and adapted by Joe Barton (and co-produced by Andy Serkis), this story focuses on four associates who go on a hiking expedition in Sweden. Apart from anything else, they come to honour the memory of deceased pal Robert (Paul Reid). Luke (Rafe Spall) holds himself responsible for his friend's death (there's a constant melancholy behind his eyes) and there is an underlying animosity from the others because of the incident.",2017

5,"October is that predictable month where cinema, TV, videogames – everything – will cash in on Halloween. There's no escaping it – but fortunately if you love some horror then it's not a time that fills you with dread; you actually find yourself looking forward to it! Not that many of these horrors are actually good; many that come out these days are predictable, cheesy and more funny than scary. Yet every now and then a horror comes out that's different; one that shakes up the genre and defies the audience's expectations, breathing fresh life into the genre. Sadly, although it may have seemed that way in the trailer, The Ritual is not one of these films. Rather, it's one of those lacklustre horrors that will inevitably find themselves in the corner of forgettable horrors on Netflix.",2017
7,"The recently released ""The Ritual"" is a monster movie, with the creature springing forth from ancient Norse legend. But it is more than that. The level of performance by a quartet of actors is a prime cut above standard scary flick fare. And there is actually a point to the proceedings beyond doom, gloom and ripping apart human flesh-a message of redemption in struggling to overcome one's most incapacitating foibles (guilt, arrogance, fear and loneliness are all explored) that resonates straight through to the end of ""The Ritual"". At times subtle, at times stark, it manages to consistently creep through the chaos with both clarity and resonance. ",2018

One wants to go here, another wants to go there, and there is no consensus. One of the members pushes the idea of going for a hike in Switzerland close to its border with Norway, and the idea isn't any more popular than any of the others.",2018
8,Netflix has been pumping out movies left and right and this movie hit the mark.,2018
8,"The key to any good horror film has always been having characters that are realistic and that the audience can relate to and care for. Yet so many horror films completely overlook this element in their film. 'The Ritual' does not make this mistake. These characters are highly flawed, but they're also relatable and we as an audience can understand (if not fully agree with) choices and decisions they've made. I suspect a lot of this stems from the fact that 'The Ritual' was based on a novel as the source material. Movies based on novels almost always contain more depth to their characters for obvious reasons.",2018

8,Caught an early screening of this film today at a Scream Unseen event & was surprised by how good it was. I had my doubts this would suck & it didn't!,2017
6,"'The Ritual' is a technically competent and conceptually confident horror picture that does manage to crank up the tension without relying on false or obnoxious jump-scares, instead using its ominous musical score and brilliantly foreboding sound design to create a slow- building sense that there's something sinister lurking amongst the trees, and it's in the script where the piece really shines as an example of a group dynamic done right because you honestly do get a sense that these four men are mates who have known each other for a long time and that they are all different people who react differently to their bizarre and frightening situation; it's when the film moves into its third act when it starts to lose its way a bit, and the closer it comes to its eponymous ritual the less tense and unique it gets, but the finale does introduce a visually interesting and well developed creature that's only real fault is being shown slightly too much during its climactic debut, a shame since prior to then it was handled with a deft restraint that allowed the flick's infrequent yet visceral splashes of gore to truly have an impact, which does happen right before a little bit of a rushed and wet ending. 6/10",2017

9,"True stories are the one thing throughout the film industry that can't be known as being a dime a dozen because it seems as though almost half of the films nowadays are based on true events. Of that half, I'd say only about half of those stories are done with complete justice and care. So, it's really a toss-up when going into a film like this. With that said, Only the Brave is a fantastic presentation of these events and the men who risked their lives on a daily basis. Although it may feel a little slow at times, here is why I believe this is a film that's pretty much for everyone. ",2017
10,"Personally I found nothing wrong with this movie which is something I rarely say when I go to the theaters now days. The cast was great and really got you interested in the characters. It stayed mostly true to the actual story of these brave men whilst throwing in a little bit more drama and action to ""Hollywood"" it. The ending will have you shedding a tear even though we all knew what happens going into it. Was well worth the money spent and deserves a higher rating than critics have given it.",2017
8,"""Only the Brave"" (2017 release; 133 min.) brings the story if the Granite Mountain Hot Shots fire squad. As the movie opens, ""Based on True Events"" we are reminded, we get to know Eric Marsh and his gang, as they are trying to get certified as Hot Shots, allowing them to combat wild fires in the front line. We also get to know Brendan, a doped-out loser whose girlfriend just got pregnant. Realizing he needs to turn his life around, Brendan applies to join the fire squad and for reasons unknown until much later in the movie, Eric decides to give Brendan a shot. In a parallel story, we also get to know Eric;s wife Amanda, a horse whisperer. But not all is well in their marriage... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
10,"Only the Brave is a great emotionally driven drama film about the Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighting crew that battled the Yarnell Hill fire. Well, the film is great. Director Joseph Kosinski did a great job in keeping up the pace from the intense fire battle sequences. Joseph Kosinski tackled the big budget visual effects flicks like Tron Legacy and Oblivion. Seeing him take on a smaller budget drama film was well handled. ",2017
9,With the recent fires in Napa & Sonoma this movie is even more involving and relevant. It's well made and filmed. And the story is firstly interesting then exciting and tragic. It doesn't feel like it is over 2 hours long.,2017
8,"Only the Brave is a movie directed by Joseph Kosinski and stars Josh Brolin, Miles Teller and Jeff Bridges. The movie is essentially a biography about the the rise of the Granite Mountain Hotshots and how they come together to put their entire lives at risk to protect their town from a dangerous wildfire.",2017

9,"There have only been a few movies in which the theater I was in went completely silent as the credits rolled. Only the Brave tells the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who risked their lives to stop wildfires across the country. It's films like this that always move me the most. A group of people who you grow fond of during the course of a film band together in the most dangerous of circumstances for a common cause. When done right, they can be extremely powerful.",2017

10,"I don't usually think about firefighters or the other service people who are tasked with keeping us safe. This movie brought them into my life and into my heart. It is unsentimental, almost unreal, almost documentary. I hadn't read anything about the story and so I had no idea where they were going with it so I allowed myself to become completely engaged with the characters, with their lives.",2017
9,"""Only the Brave"" conveys the true story of the heroic firefighters from Arizona, known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots. This movie is definitely relevant and timely, considering the recent disastrous fires in California. I know that there have been other movies based on firefighting stories, but none of them have tackled the issue of fighting and controlling a wildfire in the countryside. ""Only the Brave"" does that, which makes it so special and outstanding.",2017
9,"Not everybody has heard the true story this movie is based on. I went into this movie only based on what I saw in the trailer. Since it's nonfiction, I knew it wouldn't be your typical cookie-cutter type narrative, but I still expected it, and was blown away by the tragic events, and the extraordinary way it was presented on screen.",2017
10,Superb acting with a story line that'll draw you in and really make you feel like you're part of the crew. Loved it. Can't believe someone would rate this poorly and call it cliché.

And of course the final event was exactly as it happened as best as anyone can determine. All of the actors should be commended. Not a weak one in the bunch.",2017

10,"For me, a movie is mostly about escapism. I see a movie to forget about a bad day at work or global turmoil. If I can learn something in a move, all the better. This movie achieved both for me. Being from Nevada, I was familiar with the tragedy and I have visited Prescott several times, so I was eager to watch the movie. What I didn't expect was the fine acting in the film. Brolin really played his part well and the other characters are certainly those you will begin to care about and relate to. This movie was not about fighting fires it was about brotherhood and courage. I learned that confronting a fire is similar to being in a war zone and the comradery among the men just as strong. It's a seriously emotional experience, but worth every one of the 134 minutes. See it.",2017
10,Very touching story. These people are real heroes. They are brave not only on fighting fires but also fighting drugs. It's amazing that Brendon picked up his life. That is responsibility!

9,"Unexpected, dark, quirky, Counterpart is a noir sci-fi fantasy playing in today's world but within a setting mixed with modern (2017) and retro (1970's) locations and gizmos- The story is not about the past, it is about the present, but of 2 parallel worlds that connect through a secret doorway or hallway, and just as it mixes between the contrasts in these 2 worlds in the story so does it mix in its set design, with a little hint of dystopia here and there.

9,"A strong opener with a particularly strong performance from JK Simmons, Counterpart lures you in without quite knowing where you are going and then blam! the story opens up and gives a reveal to what is to come.
Simmons is both the mild mannered civil servant and his 'counterpart' hardened 'in the know' operative, he plays both roles strongly enough to believe they are two separate persons and is a good enough actor to hold the opener to the series on his own, although a decent performance from both Ulrich Thomsen (Banshee) and Harry Lloyd make this a tough contender.
For those with a love of sci-fi without lazer guns and 'pew pew' noises Counterpart will ring, it has the quality feel of Westworld right from the opening music and had me girpped within 2 minutes.
Decent tempo to the opener, not too fast and not dragging its heels, helped keep interest alive right up to the final scene.
I hope it lives up to it's potential.",2017
8,The first episode opens with a hint of something sinister.,2018
10,"Wow. I was blown away by the first episode of this (surprisingly) American spy thriller. I say surprisingly because this has the feel of British or European film noir reminiscent of Carol Reed's The Third Man- empty echoing streets, tall nameless post-war Berlinesque buildings, taut sparse plot and seemingly artless cinematography. It avoids the all too familiar pitfalls of typical Hollywood big studio gloss with its tell-all format and predictable casting. ",2018
9,I am still asking questions and wondering things about this episode. I am on IMDB all the time and I don't quite understand why it says down by 70? (maybe the wrong place to ask this?) The red arrow looks so depressing to me. ,2018

8,Counterpart begins darkly claustrophobic in a mysterious present day world. We meet Howard Silk who works for a strange group that is kind of like a men in black organization which the purpose of will slowly be developed. The initial bizarre feel isn't wasted as Howard is thrust into a quite surreal new reality. That reality is a parallel universe in which there is now conflict between two worlds. The unique way in which the two world's are presently interacting threatens the harmonious division of the two and Howard is unwittingly a key player.,2017

5,"The premise of the show seems really interesting. Unfortunately the plot so far (only watched the pilot) is basically a run-of-the-mill spy thriller with the parallel dimension twist. The characters are uninteresting, J.K. Simmons performance is solid as expected but can't make up for the mediocre writing. Nothing really stands out and the premise isn't enough to keep the viewer returning for another episode. This show will probably bomb hard, A+ for effort though.",2017
6,"Good application for a fantastic story, but in the end... Yet disappointed. Boring as hell. A lot of empty unnecessary scenes. Very similar to TV series ""Fringe"", but the show ""Fringe"" was much more interesting and believable, despite the fact that the plot of the TV series ""Fringe"" more than fantastic. Don't know if I'd ever get to watching the second episode.",2018

9,"The acting is really incredible
The story is fresh, and not old.. No idea what that one review is going on about. And i have literally seen almost every piece of science fiction made in the last 50 years.... perhaps they are making comparisons to bookes more than film, which in that case everything has been written about 100x over. Its almost impossible to come across a book written today that doesnt share something from a previous work before. especially science fiction...
I for one have never seen a cold war style parallel universe show before. 
And nothing close to a scifi show with this intriguing of a plot with a high budget and one of the best actors around. Science fiction until very recently wasnt considered high enough caliber to attract these types of actors.... 
But the genre is finally being adopted by all the biggest directors around now and attracting all the best talent. Mute and Annihilation this year will be amazing. Counterpart is up with them as far as im concerned",2018
1,"I just watched the pilot. Pacing is too slow and most of the episode is filler, characters are not likable and storytelling is boring. The scenario is also already-done, having a parallel world in which any crazy thing could happen. The Arab looking hitwoman gets shot in the face and guess what? She runs away as if it was no big deal!",2018
10,Kind of reminds me of Fringe series. It is based around a parallel universe and keeps you wanting to see more and more. It has that mystery factor and the characters develop in a thought out manner! ,2018
5,"I like the concept. Really. But why doesn't the surprised Howard have a thousand questions? How can he just accept (almost) everything (almost) without asking? It's a very strange world to suddenly have an extra part in. I'm a sceptic, but willing to keep watching. For now. You scratch my back ...",2017
3,"I was so looking forward to this show. Yes, it uses concepts that are sometimes overdone (parallel universe, various spy tropes), but it had the potential to be unique with older cast members and lack of a budding romance as a central focus. They could have taken that to some great places, but so far (episode 3) they have not. The spy stuff is typical spy fare, the sci-fi portion is run-of-the-mill. The acting is great, but the story itself lacks interest, originality, depth, and pacing. I feel no emotional connection to any of the characters. I hope it improves, but I am not holding my breath.",2018
3,"With so much great programming in the way of TV series out there these days, the competition has gotten pretty stiff among programs that deserve my viewing time, and Counterpart so far hasn't made the grade.

7,"I don't get the hype around that, after Stranger things, Dark (and a lot of older productions), etc., it's another parallel worlds story. It is not actually special, the story is OK, but not that fantastic either, It is not intriguing at all, they keep everything secretive because there is actually not that much else to do with that. I feel like when we will know the fall, we will just be like, OK, whatever. It's good for young folks that know nothing about sci-fi, but if you have a bit of experience, there is not that much to play around with that series (so far).",2018
8,"Get Out provided me with something I long for. The debut of a new filmmaker that makes you look hopefully into the future. Jordan Peele has done just that. He wrote and directed this smart, elegant film and even made us find a new way to classify it. Horror, comedy, drama, social satire. What matters really is that it's a first of sorts and then some. It introduced me also to a major talent in front of the camera. Daniel Kaluuya is sheer perfection. As an actor he projects and provokes empathy. Whatever your race or races you will be in his shoes, feeling what he's feeling. I was him, throughout. The gasps of fear mixed with the bursts of laughter from the audience - me included - made Get Out one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2017. Kudos also to Bradley Whitford and the phenomenal Catherine Keener. They are terrifyingly recognizable and what about Caleb Landry Jones? Menacing enough and comic enough - he reminded me of Peter, Chris Elliott's character in Everybody Loves Raymond - to be all the things he needed to be. Perfect. As is the human relief provided by the wonderful Marcus Henderson. As you may gather I'm celebrating. So, Mr Peele, thank you very much.",2017
8,"""Get Out"" takes the initial premise of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and then twists it with ""The Stepford Wives"" to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn't arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn't taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They're a lost cause. Instead, he's looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, ""Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn't work for them?""",2017
9,I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).,2017
1,So predictable that you can complete the story arc in your head twenty minutes into the movie (I'm being generous; the trailers pretty much give it away). Ridiculous overacting: the acting in the early plantation scenes was so B-grade awful that I almost couldn't tell whether Peele was satirizing a kind of black paranoia regarding socially-awkward white behavior or trying to set them up as creepy villains. Moves at a snail's pace towards the obvious: the white people actually want to subjugate all of the black people in the movie. Shocker there!,2017
1,I felt little more than pity for Peele after watching this movie. His sad fantasy view of white people and their motives towards black people reveals a disturbed and paranoid world view.,2017
9,"Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves.",2017
4,"I finished watching Get Out over 2 hours ago, but something has been bothering me since the credits rolled. A sort of unpleasant, irritated feeling that I couldn't really put my finger on until now. My biggest complaint about this horror film is that it's not actually as scary as the real life social problems it constantly hammers the viewer over the head with. It's campy jump scares and unbelievable premise, drown out the anti-racist message it could have had. In that way, it fails both as a horror movie and constructive social commentary.",2017
1,"It's time for a young African American to meet with his white girlfriend's parents for a weekend in their secluded estate in the woods, but before long, the friendly and polite ambiance will give way to a nightmare. The first time that i watched the 'Get Out' trailer i knew that this film was going to suck and guess what? it does in so many levels. First of all this film is racist to the goddamn bone from start to finish this crazy family kidnaps black men and women and turns them into zombies so their crazy relatives can live on forever it's like a crazy Frankenstein experiment they take off their brains or some sort of dumb idea and they basically become them but once you hit them with a light they just snap out of it for a few seconds at least. The whole story makes no sense and the characters are dreadful to even sit threw, Daniel Kaluuya is the only good thing about the movie but not even he can save such a disappointment also i'm trying to process the word ""comedy"" that so many reviewers used in their reviews i mean 'Scary Movie 5' had better jokes in it and Scary Movie 5 was a complete disaster too but at least i laughed at how stupid it was in here? It's just words like 'nigga' or 'my man' that are supposed to be funny. The movie as i said it's racist against black people and they all treated like subjects or just empty boxes so they can fill in some crazy mastermind. It's truly sad that some good actors participated in this but it's not their fault that the film was a disaster or that basically the 3rd act turned into an action/horror film. Jordan Peele's Directional Debut it's not only bad but it should be considered as one of the worst horror films that has ever been made plus he isn't funny at all, this film is easily the worst film of 2017 so far and it even beats 50 Shades Darker pretty easily in my book. (0/10)",2017
5,"Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing and saying the things that white people say to black people in an attempt to prove they aren't racist. ",2017
10,"I was totally blown away by ""Get Out"". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited ""fish out of the water"" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. ""Get out"" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick.",2017

1,Can't think of a good reason to recommend this.,2017
5,"The premise for Get Out is interesting and makes for an unusual horror. The premise, although good, deteriorates into clichés by the end, never fully fleshing out any of the characters and injecting humour where it doesn't really fit. The opening credits (and song) are haunting and evocative but the film itself portrays the characters as one dimensional. All of the white characters are evil and all of the black characters are victim. As usual, in Americas depiction of race, there is no middle ground, only white and black; no biracial, no latino, no Native American, only one Asian character randomly thrown in.",2017
1,"Someone remembers the movie Skeleton Key (2005, with Kate Hudson!)!? Well, Get Out is basically the same plot, whereas in Skeleton Key the transferring of the soul or whatever is done with black magic in Skeleton Key a neurosurgical procedure gets the job done. So the plot is mostly (besides the well-done clash of black and white folks culture) a copy cat (as Skeleton Key plays in the deep South we got also a little of the element of black/white culture contrasting).",2017
9,"Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern. ",2017
3,The film is pretty basic and is fairly slow with loads of stereotypes that really is not much horror but dark anti white comedy which is sad to even say is appropriate in any scenario.,2017
2,"I regret paying for this on blue ray. The hype gave more to this movie then it deserved. As it was from the makers of Insidious and conjuring, I thought this might be something enjoyable, since those movies are campy, fun, roller coasters horror movies, that are set in a less then believable world, so you can suspend your suspension of disbelief for them. ",2017
1,This has got to be one of the most OVER-RATED crappy movies that I have ever seen...100% on Rotton Tomatoes basically tells me that someone has either been paid quite a bit of money to buy a bogus review...Or somebody has sold their soul to the devil...,2017
1,"for starters this movie is absolute Garbage. WARNING: might contain spoilers. this is probably the most racist movie I have seen so far. 1 a black man with a white girlfriend goes to visit the girl's white family is classified as HORROR film. 2. ""too many white ppl makes me nervous"". 3 black ppl are depict as violent individual. 4. the black guys friend works for TSA. 5.white ppl wants black ppl for all sorts of slavery related tasks. if this movie was directed by a white guy chances are the number of lawsuits have skyrocketed to be the historical movie with the most lawsuits.",2017
2,"Get Out is the directorial debut of comedy writer Jordan Peele who has taken a page out of the Quentin Tarantino wish fulfillment fantasy playbook. Unlike Tarantino, Peele operates in the much more lucrative horror genre, his film grossing $184 million worldwide against a mere $4.5 million budget.",2017
1,"Seriously, when I watched this, it had an 8.1 rating. I wonder why. I mean, has this movie been watched only by people who have never seen classics before? The acting is not natural, the story line is incomplete on all accounts and the entire movie is totally predictable. It's a combination of a couple of movies combined. But the story line is as unoriginal as the title itself. And then suddenly the story switches from the friend point of view, where it seems to want to become a comedy, but it never really does. This is not a horror movie. Seriously, it is insulting to all horror movies ever made to be called a movie in that genre. It is a thriller with some horror filled seconds at the most. It is never scary, it is never really keeping you on the edge of your chair. And on top of that, it's never believable. Especially the 'transplant' part. I mean, hello, it was about hypnosis, remember, and why all the white people want their brain cut in half or something and become a different race. How does it work keeping both identities alive? The other black men and women seem to just be in some kind of trance but who's inside? the husband of the older woman? and did she pick him for being a hot young black man, or what? I notice it irritates me to write this actually. it's badly written and directed, racist and stereotypical and just misguiding of genres. Want to see a good movie? Want to save some precious time in your life? Then watch anything but this.",2017
1,"This movie has the worst plot I've ever seen in a horror movie. It's right there with all the Jeepers Creepers movies. The fact that white people want to use black people for their own personal happiness is what really gets me. This is seriously the highlight of the movie. Somehow all white people want to use black people for their bodies. Another form of slavery with a terrible horrible film twist. Not only is this premise terrible overall, its very unbelievable. A skinny tall flat chested/ no butt white woman seduces black men and takes them home to become her parents experiments. And somehow no one goes out to look for their black family members. No one cares. People just go missing after dating a white chick and no one cares. Oh yeah at the end of this movie, the black guy someone how survives and his friend comes to his rescue in a cop car. His friend wasn't even a police officer, he worked in an airport. This movie is a complete WASTE OF TIME! It sucks",2017
8,the newest film made by jordan peele lives out to the hype that it made.horror comedy is one of the hardest genres(or sub genres) to make a movie about.some good examples would be evil dead 2 and scream.the film actually takes a subject like racism and makes it into a parody of itself.the comedy of the movie is actually really subtle and your'e not gonna walk into the movie and start laughing as a joke comes along.its a realization that can be made while watching the film or after you watched it.it can't be really called a satire of horror movies because it uses the horror movie clichés more than once but the good part is that i doesn't annoy you like a lot of horror movies do.one of the strengths of the movie is that you don't need to be an American to understand the story.a basic knowledge about racism will be enough.but for the clues and metaphors that are in the movie you need to pay more attention and know a little bit more.there are no jokes in the movie and even the comedy relief character lil rel howery doesn't make jokes but sells its comedy by his performance which makes him actually funny and not just an annoying side character like we see mostly in the movies right now.the performances are great and the character choices are rational and logical unlike most horror movies we see today.allison williams does a pretty good job and actually nails the character far more better than i expected.the cinematography is pretty good but it got distracting in two or three places of the movie but it wasn't boring and actually kept the movie pretty good looking.the twists of the movie will actually kinda predictable but that wasn't what the movie was about and i didn't expected to be shocked since the movie doesn't take itself to seriously but serious enough to keep the plot going.the CGI blood were kinda distracting and the movie got slow in a few places but it had the pay-off and you were rewarded after the scenes.the movie is well made and deserves a second viewing in some time and i would recommend it to horror fans or if your'e a fan of subtle humor and comedy.,2017
3,"I didn't really rate this movie as it just was not scary at all. Usual ""creepy"" characters, acting was mediocre and just the whole silliness of it all just killed it for me. ",2017
1,"The movie is okay but not very good - and especially the marketing as a horror movie is a wrong lead - the horror-elements are really just a very few (I wasn't scared once) and also the story is not very clever (that the girl is kind of bait I did know almost right from the start). Big flaw: in a world where many white people are racists the rich white people want ""black skin""!? Sorry, that makes no sense at all. A scene where a young black guy is walking the streets and recognizes a car following him and we hear him talking to himself that he wants no trouble is really a good one where I was able to emphasize with the troubles and feelings a young black man could have in a society where they are often regarded as dangerous etc. - why should someone want to have such troubles!? Ofc such people (if they would have the chance of ""bodyswitching"") would get the skin/body of a beautiful white man or woman. This imo is one of the very big flaws in that movie (the story line provides some more major flaws) and it shows hard one fact - the makers of Get Out didn't know what kind of movie they wanted to make: a satire on today's society, a horror movie, a comedy, a thriller, sci-fi, a buddy movie!? In the end we get a big mixed up cocktail which in some parts works well and in others it doesn't - Get Out is not a cocktail created by a master bartender but by an apprentice, the sum of the parts doesn't add up to a very good taste but taste too sweet, too sour, too whatever. Because of all that super-hype I give this movie a rating of 1, real rate is something like a 4, maybe a 5. The acting is good but nobody will remember that movie in the years to come.",2017
5,"Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.",2017
4,"Why remake Murder On The Orient Express when there are so many titles from Agatha Christie's bibliography that have never been made. Specially this one, directed in 1974 by Sidney Lumet - a genius at having many great actors within a confined space, think 12 Angry Men - with a cast that was to die for. The 2017 Kenneth Brannagh couldn't survive the comparison and it doesn't. I missed the elegance and the wit. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination for his Hercules Poirot here Kenneth Brannagh's mustache will get all the attention as well as Johnny Depp's incomprehensible performance. Then, of course, the score. The original Richard Rodney Bennett became a classic. So, I ask you, was this necessary?",2017
5,"When I first saw the cast line-up for this film, I thought it was going to be a masterpiece. Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp etc. The list goes on. But, it goes to show that a brilliant cast cannot make-up for mediocre. ",2017
5,Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classic Agatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely are successful?,2017

2,"I am loathe to put the boot in to any film but the barrage of publicity for this, plastered all over the BBC news and chat shows - Graham Norton and Andrew Marr interviewing the phalanx of ""stars"" in a suitable subservient way - has pushed this reviewer over the edge. It is a film that didn't need a remake since the original was perfectly acted and nuanced. Perhaps that is half the problem - I know the ""solution"" and therefore the denouement is no surprise- but there is something more deeply flawed with this movie. Firstly - that moustache. Ridiculous and in the end it becomes something that you stare at and wonder just why something so outrageously stupid would NOT get in the way of what words the actor is actually saying. You stop listening and just try and see where it is stuck on. Branagh stomps around the various scenes like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (even down to walking along the top of the snow-covered carriage as if he was king of the castle) and then addresses the suspects in a scene that is reminiscent of The Last Supper painting. Everywhere he goes everyone knows him. Absolutely everyone. The opening scenes in Jerusalem are unnecessary and only serve to raise Branagh/Poirot into God like status where the population of the city are happy to take his word and trample a suspect policeman to death. No jury, no trial, lynch mob rules. All of which seems to bother the guardian of justice not one jot.",2017
4,"I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and afterwards thought what was the point? Did Kenneth Branagh do it for self indulgence. In 1974 it was great to see Albert Finney, Laureen Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connerry etc playing the parts. There was a still a certain mystique about film stars, especially the ones from yesteryear. Now on the Graham Norton show we can see how vacuous so many of them are. Yes the scenery was spectacular. The costumes were great. But honestly, really honestly other than having several A Listers or B+ Listers who hardly open their mouths and a Hercules Poirot in Branagh not in the same class as Finney or David Suchet I would say that TV does these thrillers much much better these days. The opening scene in Jerusalem was like something out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But Poirot is no Indiana Jones. The ending which tells us that we can prepare ourselves for a remake of Death on the Nile. No thank you, even if Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks are in it!",2017

She predicted, in ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead,"" that some idiot would dramatize her books by adding sex and violence that was not in her original work and hypermasculinizing Poirot, while dumbing down her expert character development in a way that insults the audience's intelligence. She knew it had to happen. And it has.",2017
4,"Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance. ",2017
7,"There's a big problem with Kenneth Branagh's 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that's the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the ""who"" of the ""whodunnit"" (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.",2017
7,"I must admit as an Agatha Christie obsessed fan, my initial thoughts were of pure joy, it's been a while since Agatha Christie was on the big screen, appealing to new fans, and how magnificent that such a stellar cast was assembled. Then I thought, of all the titles, why go for such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.",2017
9,"When was the last time Hollywood gave us a true old school style ""whodunit"" type of film? (Don't strain your brain here. You can take it as rhetorical.) These types of stories, where a detective is presented with a crime scene and figures it all out with just their intellect and powers of observation have always been a big part of my life. Trying to figure out the culprit before its eventual reveal was always challenging to me, and putting these stories on the big screen have kind of faded into the background. So, what do you do when you want to bring them back? Call Kenneth Branagh.",2017
8,"I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, it's not perfect, and sometimes Branagh overdo it a little, but whoever likes the genre will be captured by the fantastic atmosphere and will not be bored, because Branagh has been able to put some pepper on the story. His Poirot convinced me and the old glories like Judy Dench, Willelm Defoe and Johnny Depp do their job and do it well, but in my opinion the most interesting notes come from the young people: I personally loved Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, but the real surprise was Sergei Polunin: I mean, for those who saw him performing as dancer, it's not a real surprise, but it's really hard to believe it was his first time in a movie! He has given to his character this melancholy, turbulent and passionate aura, halfway between a Shakespearean prince and James Dean. His expressions, his little gestures, the way he looked at his wife, he made me feel like a teenager who cannot wait to buy his poster and stick it over her bed! And let me say, that guy definitely knows how to ""handle"" a woman as well as he can deliver a kick! As usual, more the critics hate a film, more it worth to be seen.",2017

2,"If you have never seen the 1974 original..you may want to see this, may that is. If you HAVE seen the 1974 original, which I refer to as a CLASSIC, stay as far away as you can from any theater showing this waste of time. The original version, directed by the awesome Sidney Lumet and starring the brilliant Albert Finney (an Oscar nominee) as Poirot, was a masterful piece with great writing, directing and a cast that couldn't be beat!! And this new version, Directed by ego-magic Branagh, and starring a so-so cast, with some stellar actors, all being decimated by this production is downright tragic. From the opening piece, set in Istanbul which has nothing to do with anything, with regard to the plot, till it's exceptionally tedious laughable end, taking place in a tunnel in a snow covered mountain, you just won't believe your eyes.",2017
2,"I was so looking forward to this remake.. Kenneth Branagh is so very talented. His live action Cinderella was delightful, But this remake looks beautiful but is so wordy and boring. For the first ten minutes we are shown how clever Poirot is and after a lot unnecessary padding eventually we get on to the train . With all its glory. Great photography. But there was virtually no character development; and the sound was so poor ( even At The Odeon Leicester Square) that I did not have a clue what was going on.(which is partially why there are no spoilers.)In fact it was so dull I nodded off and woke up when the murder had been committed . So I did not have a clue who was dead.( so no spoiler! An hour had passed and the rest of the film trundled along like a slow goods train, whilst Branagh did his stuff. I think he thought he was playing in Shakespeare's Henry the fifth. For at the denouement, he just went on and on and on with speech after speech, in that phoney French accent which was like a bad imitation of Maurice Chevalier. In fact had it been a musical, I was waiting for him to burst into song! Mercifully this travesty ended and we left. Incredibly disappointed.",2017
8,"As much as the Murder on the Orient Express book is appreciated as a classic, I came into this movie without knowing the story. I want to start by talking about Hercule Poirot as a character. This movie really portrays Poirot in a Sherlock Holmes ""esque"" light. There's a point where Hercule takes someone out with a cane that felt like he was channelling Robert Downey Jr. in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I don't mean this as a criticism though, the fact that Hercule is witty and funny along with being brilliant is much needed levity for this movie. Some people have complained that the movie is too comedic but without those opportunities to laugh, the beginning of this movie would be unbearably slow. Those moments are like the spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. So, I liked Poirot and you needed a charismatic character at the centre because the other characters don't get developed much until the murder goes down. This movie looks like an ensemble, but it leans more heavily on Branagh as the main character than you would think.",2017
7,"No I have never read the book, or seen a film that was made over 40 years ago, but I do love the 'myster' genre and this film didn't disappoint. Beautifully directed and produced.

5,I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 purely because I love Agatha Christie stories.,2017
9,"I haven't seen the 1974 version so this movie easily stands out in all aspects to me, whether it was the camera view or the cast ensemble. While reviewing, people often forget the issue with the original story i.e. it's set entirely in the train. Considering the limited space that they had, Branagh does an amazing job with the direction. This isn't just a remake but in fact an entirely different adaptation. Not that it runs away from the main story but it has a sort of different take on it. Apart from that, Branagh easily manages to portray Poirot with all his eccentricity. (The accent was the pull factor for me). Josh Gad does an amazing job with Hector McQueen. Judi Dench shines as Princess Dragomiroff along with Pfeiffer as Mrs. Hubbard. The only bummer was the fact that it leaves you wanting for more.",2017
8,"I love the book so I was really excited to see this, and I have to say I was not disappointed. The acting was brilliant and the film very well made. Aside from a few changes it mostly follows the book quite closely which I was pleased about and the end was especially well done. I have to confess that I haven't actually got round to seeing any of the other adaptions of the book yet but I certainly enjoyed this one.",2017
8,"I really enjoyed this movie even though I adore the original. I went in with mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horrible Hollywood remake, well it wasn't. Especially with a star cast like this it would have been easy to just let the writing and directing slide by so my fear was not that irrational. Branagh absolutely shone in his role as Poirot just like the rest of the cast did in their roles. Sure they added to the background stories of the characters but why shouldn't they? And are people seriously complaining that they added a black doctor? Seriously people. I was afraid they would americanize it but they didn't. This movie is not worse than the original. It is not without the Christie Charme. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again.",2017
6,"Greta Gerwig, usually disappoints me - as an actress and now in her writing and directorial debut, LADY BIRD, a coming-of-age film about a seventeen-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento ""the Midwest of California"" (the best line in the film,) and the love/hate relationship she has with her working-class family and peers. Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of ""ironic class strivers."" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.",2017
9,"How refreshing and invigorating to meet new people. Familiar and new all at the same time. Familiar because the extraordinary Saorise Ronan connected me to her soul, as soon as she appeared on the screen. Remarkable. She is, without question, one of the best actresses of her generation. She has exceptional support here, Laurie Metcalf as the mother determined to keep her feelings at bay, Lucas Hedges, providing one of the most moving, truthful moments in the film and allowing Saorise Ronan to give us a masterful class in empathy. Timothee Chalamet proves in a very short space of time that he is here to stay. His Elio in Call Me By your Name will be considered one of the great breakthrough performances in film history. Tracy Letts plays the father with irresistible humanity and then, of course, a heartfelt congratulations to the writer, director Greta Gerwing -",2017
7,"When you hear all the fantastic praise that a new Oscar bait film is getting, you should probably watch it. Even though I'm personally not the target audience or demographic for this film I still ended up liking the film quite a bit.",2017
9,Saoirse Ronan has the ability to get the viewer's sympathy like no other actress. Her sweetness just makes all she is going through so much more involving and moving. The subject matter is a young girl in high school discovering relationships with boys and struggling with her very strange mother played by the excellent Laurie Metcalf. Things like this have been done before but never quite so lucidly. Watching her deal with her gay boy friend then the douche bag boy friend then her difficult mother are played out in such a spontaneous manner with very well written natural sounding dialog. Makes you want a part 2.,2018
3,"I wish I could agree with the high-scoring reviews, but I cannot. This movie seemed flat, monotone, mildly entertaining. The lead was perfunctory...another disgruntled teen who desperately wants to get out of her home town and fly to the East Coast ""where there is culture"". New Hampshire and culture? Hmmm... 
Lady Bird clashes with her mom (Laurie Metcalf...who deserves 10 stars by herself). So, a teen clashes with her mom...wow...news flash. 
Dad loses his job...and seems to be just fine with that, even though they are running out of money. Weird. 
The supporting cast seems to be chosen to complete a requisite menu of characters: the overweight but beautiful-inside best friend, the gorgeous and wealthy but shallow new friend, the handsome but...surprise...gay boy. Somehow this lack of originality does not drive a strong story line.
The crash and burn ending is, well, the only twist in this story...so, back home she goes, and realizes she really does love Sacramento. Perhaps Sacramento is a metaphor for almost every town in America, but the story never hints at that. So, sorry, this one just did not resonate with me.",2017
8,"Lady Bird was very well-received at its local premiere at the Paramount Theater for the Austin Film Festival. I found it to be a sweet, charming coming-of-age film. It is a serious film, but with flashes of humor. Greta Gerwing wrote and directed the film which seemed to be partly autobiographical in that she grew up in Sacramento, CA at about the same time as her character. The film is a meditation on what it means to be from some place and what that idea of home means in shaping who you become. She has a love-hate relationship with her city, her family and her place in both. It is also very much a story of young girl struggling with her own and her mother's expectations for herself. The script is really charming with the best scenes being those of Lady Bird and her mother. Lady Bird is struggling with sexuality, family, friendship, religion and even her own name all at the same time. Like all of us, she is trying to find her place in the world. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Lady Bird as is Laurie Metcalf in the role of her haggard struggling mother trying to hold her family together through difficult times. Recommended to those who like drama, particularly coming-of-age films.",2017
8,"Every one of us can remember their senior year of high school. For some of us, it was great, for others it wasn't. No matter what the quality of that year was, we all experienced adulthood for the first time and prepared for our lives to change forever. Lady Bird tells this exact story through the eyes of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson as she tries to carve her own path while also trying to navigate the pressures of her final year in high school. ",2018
8,"Honestly, ""Lady Bird"" caught my eye months before it even came out. As a fan of smaller, 'slice-of-life' indie films, this seemed to have just the right amount of quirkiness...and I have to say, I wasn't let down. ",2018
2,"I watched the trailer and saw that it received 100% on rottentomatoes.com so I figured it must be worth watching, but when I walked out of the theater I felt disgruntled and wanted my money and time back. The movie reminded me of 'Garden State' (2004) in that it was trying to be quirky, deep, and epic all at the same time, but was just another forgettable film. It really fell flat for me and the script/dialog was sometimes awkward and/or did not make sense. I'm surprised IMDb only listed one 'goof'. There were a couple of funny moments and the soundtrack wasn't bad -- those are the only nice things I can say about it.",2017
9,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project  and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).",2017
3,"Although this movie was only about an hour and a half it felt like over two hours. I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end. The acting was good, but the plot felt like the writer took everything that could affect a teenager and threw it into a movie. I generally like thought evoking movies, but this one was just not compelling. ",2017
8,"Lady Bird, like many movies on high school kids, awkward relationships and coming-of-age tales, is a hilarious look on life and the wonders of the world that we all face. Female-driven and downright funny, Lady Bird stands alone because it does not try to own the idea that the film is solely about women and women only. ",2017

2,"A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed. ",2017
8,"Ladybird's personality is the perfect mix of quirky, emotional teen and honesty. I'm surprised the a story that is centered on a relationship between mother and daughter resonated with me. Add another classic to the list of classic coming of age movies.",2018
7,"Lady bird is a movie about a young woman and her struggling mother. Saoirse Ronan has done the central role of the movie. She is very free flowing actress and has transformed herself in the character of a teenage girl having full of dreams , fluency and lot of life. Her activities and reactions everything has made the movie a good comedy drama. Director Greta Gerwig has directed the movie very well.",2017
7,"""Lady Bird"" is an inspiring film for teenagers and practically the directorial debut the unknown Greta Gerwig, who is also the writer of this sensitive coming of age story. Saoirse Ronan has wonderful performance in the role of Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a teenager with typical adolescent problems. Troubled relationship with her mother and siblings; high-school pranks; romance; sex; disappointments with boyfriends and friends; financial problem; dream on going to college and improving life, all these elements are realistically explored by Greta Gerwig, maybe based on her personal experiences in Sacramento. The optimist conclusion with the growth of Christine is another plus in this original film. My vote is seven.",2018
9,Lady Bird is definitely one of the best coming of age films made recently. The Edge of Seventeen from 2016 could be put in the same category but this one is still better in my opinion. It will really hit close to home with everyone who live and grew up in a place where not much happens and can't wait to leave it and enter the world of excitement to try to live to the fullest someplace else.,2018
9,"Greta Gerwig ..! I think she is one of the most brilliant writers of the 21th century. Frances Ha was the very first surprising experience, then Mistress America was a stunning movie to be the next.. and now this; Lady Bird. ",2018
8,"12/31/17. Maybe 3 1/2 stars. This is a gem of a movie that is worth catching! It really is about the mother and daughter relationship at the point when it is the hardest relationship to be in - those adolescent years. Ronan is at the edge of 17, awkward and unsure of herself, her feelings, her future, etc. One thing she is sure of - her mother may love her but doesn't like her. The nuanced difference is extremely important as Metcalf is extremely careful in parsing the semantics - love is not like, and she loves her very much. The McPhersons are a lower middle class family that struggles to makes ends meet. Mom is realistic about expectations, but Lady Bird is free of those expectations, and wants to take flight to a more cultured territory, New York. This movie is about coming of age for those who dream of a better life in a country that is not as classless as it is portrayed in the mainstream. We secretly wish Lady Bird will find her happiness.",2018

10,Ladybird was not what I expected. Yes it's a coming-of-age of a young lady and the conflicts with her dominate mother. But it's has a deeper sense of loss of innocence and how youth is wasted on the young. Often young people are in a hurry to grow up. When in reality we should live in the present and not worry about the future so much. Because in the end it all works out. Good acting and emotionally compelling story.,2018

6,"I think the film was good, but didn't really live up to expectations. I didn't find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That's for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that's a big reason why I just wasn't very scared.",2017
1,"It has become ritual for me to read the novel ""It"" once a year every year since it was released in 1986. The story is more than a gore-fest, it's a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day.",2017
1,"What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the world has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience, looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting. Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity. What a shame.",2017

I believe there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I'll probably watch it - if I've nothing better to do. It's simply not Steven King's ""IT'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from ' Mama' at one point : can't find it now, but look out for it. ""Beep,beep, Richie"" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it's another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood mob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original. I hope to goodness they don't remake The Stand.",2017

1,"Wow, I honestly can't believe these reviews. I made an IMDb account just to write a review. I love the original and have seen it many times. This movie was horrible! I feel insulted by the directors. It wasn't scary at all. Any potential ""scary"" scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, major holes in the story line as well. ",2017
3,"I already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense CGI in the trailers. I felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast, however there was way too much 'comic relief'. This is a horror movie. I wanted to feel terrified because I was stuck in terror just about the whole movie. I should have left the theater sore because of being too tense. This did not happen at all. There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it (no pun intended). The clown was so cliché when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the 2,000's. It has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the Umbrella Corporation and It moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since The Ring. Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren't in a wheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place of Penny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP. The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesy and AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have ever done. It felt like this movie had SO much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it 'actually scary'. Those of you who are REAL horror movie fans, you WILL be disappointed. This should have been a 'straight to Netflix' movie as far as I'm concerned and I wish I could have gotten at least 1/2 of my money back",2017
4,"I don't even know what to say. There was so much wasted potential here. I will say that the cinematography, the location, and the children (The Losers Club) hold up really well for this film. Yet, I'm still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I'm still shaking my head. ",2017

This remake, or perhaps actually a ""re-adaptation"", is certainly very timely, what with ""Stranger Things"" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I'm still not sure it hits the ""scary"" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry's tremendous acting, but it's certainly creepy. It's not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50's setting, changed to the 80's to obviously market itself with ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Goonies"".",2017

So they can laugh along with you, I don't want to spoil the immense amount of nothing that happens in this movie, or how you'll grow bored of waiting for ""it"" to get scary, but I do want to know how much they were paying people walking into the screenings giving this movie a 10 star rating, or how large is the pr team? I laugh when I see red balloons now. Thought I was going to see a horror movie, got a comedy.. Talk about a let down.",2017
10,"I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane. The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill Skarsgård has taken Pennywise and made the role his own. Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT really possess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. ",2017
3,"I am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking. I enjoy the books, films and TV shows of Stephen King but found that this film fell way too short. The trailer looks great and Pennywise the clown looks terrifying so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but after watching this film which is over 2 hours long I could not wait for it to finish,I was waiting for it to get better but it does not - there was no scare factor whatsoever I just found it a bit boring and such a let down. I really feel this should have just gone straight to DVD - way over hyped.",2017
5,"I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologically tormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it. Unfortunately, I can't do that after seeing IT.",2017
3,"It really is ridiculous how this movie is being praised like crazy.  This movie is so fvcking generic. It wasn't scary nor was it funny.  Just stupid.  This movie is FULL of jump scares. That's literally all the movie does  in attempt to ""scare"" the audience. It's the cheapest and laziest way  to ""scare"" people. Many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead.  The scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy. What the Hell  was the point of that scene? Ridiculous.  And what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude? That zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and I felt like I was watching The  Walking Dead.  I did not give a fat fvck about ANY of the kids in this movie. I was  not interested nor was I rooting for the kids. There was nothing  special about any of the kid characters. NONE of the kids of the  ""Losers Club"" gets killed in this film. All that tension and none of  the kids get killed. Not one.   Close to the end of the film, Pennywise gets his ass beat by a group of  kids with baseball bats and chains. LOL! He couldn't fight them back.  Stupid movie.",2017
1,"If you've ever seen the original, and you have even the slightest modicum of respect for originality, story telling and artistic integrity, this movie should infuriate you. Firstly, it isn't really a movie. There is no story. It's basically just a 2 hour collection of different sorts of scares. The brilliance with the original was that it was a story of kids torn apart by a traumatic event, and then brought back together as adults to face their fears and avenge their friend. Great story. But this version was essentially a haunted house on the screen. They abandoned the kid to adult story and just focused on a group of kids getting scared. There was way too much ""comedy"" being sprinkled throughout. You know, the lame kind where the characters make some unoriginal comment and everyone in the movie theater bursts out laughing like Dave Chappelle just hit his stride on stage. And the random love stories among the kids that didn't matter or further any narrative. I could write a 10,000 word essay going into the depths of all that is wrong with this movie so I'll stop. The worst of all is watching all of America fall in love with this. It makes me feel like a cynical jerk, but I think really it's just a clear sign of the dumbing down of people on this earth. No one respects or cares about great storytelling anymore. Just give them cheap pop-up scares and they will be happy. It really is sad.",2017
7,"So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares. ",2017
6,"The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. ",2017

This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.",2017
10,"Intimate, delicate, and a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Paul Thomas Anderson manages to expresses an artist's creative journey through threads of fashion and romance with such subtlety that it could only be conveyed through the medium of film. An atmosphere reminiscent of Kubrick's achievements, this romantic odyssey illustrates a unique perspective of love; a perspective in which love is shaped and manipulated by the fragile strings of each character's hearts.

From the gay punck rocker of ""My Beautiful Launderette' to Abraham Lincoln in ""Lincoln"" Now Reynolds Woodcock, an artist in the world of fashion a man who lives his work as his only form of expression. The frustration by any form of interruption by anything or anyone out of place guarantees his private isolation and yet he craves the warmth of human intimacy. The complexity of Ryan Woodcock becomes totally accessible in Daniel Day Lewis's eyes, with every move, with every silence. It is a monumental, beautiful creation. His Alma - the Alma that he chooses - is played with Bergmanesque intensity by Vicky Krieps and she's a perfect framer/embracer/provocateur in a remarkable performance. Lesley Manville is chillingly perfect as a sort of Mrs Danvers. A sister/gate keeper with an eye on everything. Was she the one that protected him from his homosexuality or it's just my imagination? I love Phantom Thread. I will see it again soon. P T Anderson gives us another scrumptious gourmet dish.",2017

10,This is the most unique romance film to come out in all of history. Paul Thomas Anderson has struck Gold again with this masterpiece. The Screenplay is really original and very engaging. ,2017
7,"Let us get this out of the way- Phantom Thread is a beautiful film with a great premise and promise. A couture dress designer (Daniel Day Lewis) is demanding in the extreme and finds a muse (Vicky Krieps). He enjoys using her as a dress model and a companion, but she wants more. Along the way, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, throws hints of intrigue starting with the title of the film. There are empty pretensions of dress-making as high art, secret messages sown into dresses and haunting memories. All of this leads to- exactly nowhere. Everything Lewis and Krieps do is recorded lovingly and meticulously on film with great mood music in the background. But there is no great reveal, no deep insight into human psyche, no higher truth. In the end it comes down to what a woman wants and what the man can live with. Lewis and Krieps are excellent, especially Krieps, but Lesley Manville as Lewis's sister has the thankless job of looking stern in every scene. Nothing in the film sticks with you when you leave the theater except the dresses, photography and the music; because Anderson has not come up with anything really interesting in the story. Unlike his ""There Will Blood"", which was a great film, Phantom Thread is a phantom film. It is a beautiful ghost of what should have been a really good film. See it if you wish to say goodbye to Daniel Day Lewis, but keep your expectations low.",2018
1,"I have been looking forward to Phantom Thread for several months and chose not to read a review because I wanted to make up my own mind on this film without another's opinion clouding my judgment. I adore Daniel Day-Lewis and think he is an incredible actor and I thought he must have picked a wonderful script if this is his last movie. I got settled in the theater's new recliner seats excited to finally see this highly anticipated film. I enjoyed looking at the clothes and 1950's London scenery but that's about all that I enjoyed. I am a mental health nurse and quickly deducted that Alma is a sociopath. She figures out Ryan's weaknesses and uses them to irritate him and manipulate him. Ryan thinks his life is cursed and had sewn ""never cursed"" into the lining of a Royal's wedding dress. When Alma sees these words sewn in the wedding gown her sociopathic scheming goes into overdrive. She cooks up an omelette with poisionous mushrooms and there is a tense scene....will he or will he not take a bite? Both characters are playing head games with each other and it develops into she poisons him then nurses him back to health and continues to do this Russian roulette until one day ""he will be waiting for me on the other side of eternity"". The head games and cat and mouse story line are uncomfortable to watch and not intriguing as the director wanted us to be. Most of the movie was dragging, so much so that I almost left but I wanted to stick it out and be fair to the film. Bottom line is this movie is meant to be strange so that is is touted as artistic but it is anything but. It is a dark draggy movie and I feel like I could have done something more productive with my time. I'm disappointed that Daniel Day Lewis choose to do this script. And one more thing....this ain't love people. No matter how you slice it these two characters do not love each other.",2018
4,"It is a pretentious film that masquerades as a work of art. It should have been and could have been an outstanding film. The photography, period pieces, countryside, etc. were all beautiful; however, the story and plot (or lack thereof) suffered and droned on unbearably. I kept waiting for the film to finally take hold of its viewers, but it never did and it never got off the ground either. Such a shame. It's a movie about an aging, single dressmaker to the wealthy with a fetish for his mother, who lives with his aging, bossy single sister and takes on a young female lover from time to time until he is annoyed with them and until his sister bosses them out. He then meets a daughter-like lover who is deadly and is even more manipulative and devious than his sister. Total waste of two hours that I'll never get back. I only gave it 4 stars because of the scenery and photography.",2018
2,"Ok first things first, give credit where credit is due. The acting cannot be faulted; Day-Lewis, Manville and Krieps are superb - captivating and convincing. Manville's portrayal of Cyril, Reynolds' sister, was highly enjoyable (indeed, I think her's was the only character I liked). The camera work also facilitated the storytelling and the setting was elegant. ",2018
3,"I waited and waited to see this movie. I was expecting something completely different than what this movie is. I was looking forward to DDL's swan song. This was more like a lame duck song. His portrayal of Mr. Woodcock is excellent as is all of the roles he plays in other productions. But Alma grated on my nerves the entire movie. There are much better actresses that could have played this role. The movie has so many 'loose threads' (pun intended). So many times the story could have fanned out to create a more in depth and cerebral experience. And, once again, a movie that had a perfect time to end (at the New Year's Eve Ball) and it would have been very effective. No hugs, kisses, cries...just grab DDL's hand and walk out. Perfect. BUT, no. It went on for another 20 minutes or so with just a great deal of nonsense and useless information that added little to the movie. It seemed like a desperate attempt to save the entire movie. When I walked out of the theater after the movie was over I was actually ticked off. For me, DDL was great but he picked a dog of a movie to retire on. BUMMER.",2018
4,"I had really been looking forward to this film. I sincerely believed the hype which I had read.
Like the parson's egg some parts of it were excellent;. Daniel Day Lewis' acting. The overall art direction, the dresses, the inner workings of a renowned fashion house. The actors all stayed in character, it is the plot, the writing, that took bizarre and inexplicable twists. So confusing I am not sure what the ending of the movie was. Were the actions in several ending scenes, just fantastical visions of Alma?
Why would Reynold not be appalled at what happened to him, rather than appreciating it as some grand joke? Who would do anything that even, inadvertently could possibly (and did) cause harm to a very expensive garment, the result of painstaking labor on the part of up to twenty people and possibly be the source of a catastrophe to a royal wedding.
The best thing I can say about it is, that my husband and I did get two sincere laughs (but the only ones in the theater to do so) from scenes at the table. And Reynold's perfect explanation of their annoyance.",2018
5,"As I watched this film I felt like I was watching ""Eyes Wide Shut""-- the glacial pacing, the fashion and the mysteriousness seemed familiar.",2017
3,"There's a lot of potential in the movie's concept: brilliant 1950's fashion designer, creating fashions for Europe's upper crust, owns a cool 1950's British sports car, a confirmed bachelor who meets a waitress and dines with her that night. Could have gone places. Didn't. This is a slow movie about some very strangely damaged people somehow accommodating each other in ways neither my wife nor I could fathom. You know how you see some movies and wonder for two hours ""When's it going to start?"" That's this movie.",2018
2,"Daniel Day-Lewis must have thought to himself, ""Why not go out in a blazing streak of fatuous pomposity?!?"" If only the endless, repetitive scenes of characters walking up and down the fancy-dancy staircase had been mercifully edited out, then it might have been closer to 90 minutes of my life I can't get back.",2018
6,"There is an unsettling disquiet that runs throughout Phantom Thread. It's sewn into the film's every narrative twist, as power balances shift and infatuation bleeds into something darker. It's lodged firmly in the way characters gain and lose sympathy over time, as they (and their motives) constantly shift in and out of the light. It's present in every frame - most of which manage to intrigue and alienate, all at once. In other words, Phantom Thread is a quintessential Paul Thomas Anderson film: a gripping psychological study that will strike some as delightful, and others as depraved. ",2018
2,"I've always had mixed feelings about P.T. Anderson -- on the one hand, he has a brilliant touch as a director, and as a fan of his dad's role as ""Ghoulardi"" on local Cleveland television growing up, I always had a soft spot for the kid. But this film is a puzzle: its gender politics are stuck in the 1950's along with its fashion choices (at one point, Day-Lewis's Woodcock crows ""Don't say the word 'chic'!""), its main characters are utterly flat, and the only interesting changes are brought about by poisonous mushrooms. No one grows, no one really steps out of themselves; trapped within Anderson's brilliantly-framed shots, they talk, argue, raise their eyebrows, and sometimes noisily crunch their toast, world without end, amen. A film must go from one place to another; someone in it must grow or experience change; we have to be somewhere different at the end than at the beginning. Here all we have is beautiful stasis -- which ultimately make this film, despite its rich artfulness, an ugly one.",2018
5,"While the movie was well acted and well put together with interesting camera work and novel use of even the most mundane sounds (such as the amplified scraping of butter on toast transforming the scene at breakfast), a character study simply does not work if you can't relate to the characters. The experience is like being stuck in the beautiful house of an intolerable acquaintance for two hours. This was the worst movie I've seen in quite some time.",2018
9,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a certain feeling that envelops me while experiencing exquisite filmmaking. It's a singular blend of peacefulness and excitement as an anticipation of greatness builds in those early scenes. That feeling has rarely swept over me as quickly as the opening moments of this new film from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, a six-time Oscar nominee.",2018
4,"Pretentious comes to mind. Daniel day lewis, the ""empty vessel"" of the acting profession, comes up short here. a non romance between a self involved ego maniac (pun intended) and a masochistic protégé. in the current atmosphere of sexual harassment, this movie shines as a prime example of the mistreatment of women. shades of Hitchcock, I hear. very pale shades, if any. lots of glowing reviews from movie goers, though.",2018
10,"We had all been waiting for it. For Paul Thomas Anderson to bring out another amazing movie, one as good as There Will be Blood and here it is.",2017
1,"Despite being written and directed by the talented Paul Thomas Anderson and starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis, Phantom Thread is 2 hours and 20 minutes of unentertainment. ",2018
8,"I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this film to typical Americans, but will say, it would be worth it if you gave it a chance.
Because the nuance will fall on folks who want to be relieved of their lives. This film is about the social elite and their issues when it comes to a consumed artist. Most people who have made art as a profession will understand completely. The story is of a man who excelled at his craft and is forced to see the human in rough sketched lines. Does that sound interesting to people who've just stepped out of ""Jumanji""? Nope. But it is high art.
This film is artwork come to life which will fall on deaf ears of the general public who want a more visceral experience. This is atmosphere and mood. The details are exquisite and beautiful. Again, if your meals require you yell through a drive-thru squaw box, don't see this.",2018
10,"Another masterpiece from the combination of Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis and reminded me about their last one "" There will be blood "". But my opinion is this movie is even better than the first one .And i think most of us will admit this.",2017
1,"I made it through two hours and walked out. That is pretty bad considering it was almost over and I did not care about missing the rest of it. I kept wondering when it would become dramatic or interesting in the least. It never does. The main character smiles incessantly at his next young lover. He has the maniacal leer of a 12 year old adolescent and that is how the film opens and carries on for 20 minutes. So I am immediately thinking ""he may be a talented designer but he is a moron and so is she."" There are no highs and lows throughout, just maudlin dialogue and frustrating relationships. The entire two hours I sat there was work and I could not make it all the way through.",2018
9,"We went to see this as part of the early screening for Amazon Prime members. I always worry that all the funniest parts of a movie are spoiled in the trailer leaving nothing left in the film. That isn't the case. I was either smiling or laughing the entire movie, as was the rest of the theater. Is it Citizen Kane? No. Was I going to the theater wanting to watch a drama that delved deep into the characters' lives? No, again.",2017
9,"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.",2017
9,"I actually come to watch this movie with low expectation. I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.",2017
9,"All of the performers are fantastic in this film, and are perfect fits for their roles. The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't. Black is perfect for this role, and nails every comedic moment he's given. They are all fantastic together, and it makes for some great entertainment...",2017
10,Fun movie for family. Silly at times with decent action and interesting people. If you are a guy wanting to bring wife/girlfriend to movie you'll both walk out feeling you got your money's worth then this is a great pick. It won't win any fancy awards but best movie in theaters right now.,2017
10,"Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it.

10,"Really enjoyable movie! The movie is well paced, great cast, great action sequences. I think this is a must see movie, for all the family.",2017
9,I watched Jumanji yesterday in 3D and I must say that movie is fully exciting till the end. Everyone has acted very well and Junanji never lets you down at any moment throughout the movie runtime. Not only the story is very well written but also the director has executed it perfectly. Dr. Smolder Bravestone and Ruby Roundhouse has done ass kicking action sequences.Whereas Shelly Oberon and Franklin Mouse Finbar has done nice comic scenes.,2017
9,"This movie definitely got me attached! Loved the roles for the film, and definitely love the story line and comedy. It had characters you could get attached to (including the main antagonist) and it had pretty everything certain people could enjoy from an Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy movie! Especially for some of the older ages. It even had some pretty intense scenes compared to the older film. I suggest you to watch this movie if you're into these kinds of films, I definitely got a few laughs out of it, hope you will too!",2017
9,"I'll start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the Robin Williams/Bonnie Hunt Jumanji movie, I personally thought it was alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.",2017
10,"I would watch this movie two more times at least. This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it. Thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen.",2017
9,"I really enjoyed ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". ""Jumanji"" is way more than its movie trailer. Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillan are awesome. The Rock embodies a genuine ""nerd' charm in his action hero persona. It's nice to 'see' Karen not hidden behind the Nebula visage of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I'm a fan from her short lived series ""Selfie"". Gillan is beautiful, beguiling, and comedic charm. Jack Black as Shelly the gender swapped avatar practically steals the show illustrating the movie's surprising message. ",2017
8,"The original Jumanji is a nostalgic film from my childhood. It still held up when I rewatched it earlier this month. The effects aren't the greatest but the film was fun and had a lot of heart. I was not one of those annoying people who had pitchforks out when they heard about Jumanji being rebooted or getting a sequel. Always give a film a chance, that's what I do. After seeing promo pics and trailers I was hyped. I like The Rock and Kevin Hart working together, and also love Karen Gillan. The film looked like a fresh spin on the original and even looked like an effort that wanted to stand on its own. It does exactly that. Say what you want, this is a very fun film.",2017
8,"The original Jumanji was supposed to be a one-and-done film, even though it teased the potential for a sequel. Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.",2017
9,"Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!",2017
8,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is easily the best video game movie ever made. Everyone who follows movies even remotely knows that's not a hard task to complete, but Jumanji earnestly gets that title from me by being self-aware, armed with charismatic performances, and an undeniably fun and energetic tone from beginning to end.",2017
6,"Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it's not Jumanji, 6.5/10.",2017
8,"Jumanji is a film I grew up with so it'll always hold a place in my heart. It's by no means the greatest film ever made but it is a film I never thought would need a sequel, the very idea being a product of the lazy Hollywood cycle. To do a sequel to Jumanji, you have to be brave enough to evolve the franchise and not just rehash it all, which is exactly what they did with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.",2017
8,"My wife and I got to see an early screening of this movie. We went in with low expectations because of how much we loved the first one. WOW were we blown away. The comedy is top notch and honestly Jack Black steals the show. There were a 2 or 3 jokes I didn't think should be in the movie because younger kids will be watching. Other than that the action, comedy, and story are all top notch. Go check it out.",2017
9,"Really enjoyable, so many laughs! The movie is well paced, great cast, great action sequences. One reviewer on here said that it was awful, with no laughs, and that the audience were totally silent... he must've seen a different movie to me! The audience that I was a part of were definitely not silent! I liked the way they made the jumanji board game into a video game, it doesn't take anything away from the original movie. I think this is a must see movie, for all the family.",2017
8,"Wow! That's what I thought after leaving seeing this movie. I honestly thought this wouldn't be that good, especially since Jumanji is an amazing classic that's very hard to remake. But I was wrong. Jack Black, The Rock, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart play their roles perfectly. The story is great, and it really does feel like another Jumanji movie. Jack Black is hilarious, and there's even some references to the late Robin Williams. Great work!",2018
8,This was one entertaining and funny movie! It was cast perfectly and directed well. You will appreciate it more if you're a gamer. 8/10 from me,2018
8,"Jumanji 2 is a hilarious, fun, escapist, adventure movie starring The Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. Using video game rules, the movie truly brings video game magic to the screen, and subtly pokes fun at the action genre. The Rock is great as usual and has a literally huge presence in the movie. The chemistry among the cast is great, and the Rock proves once again he is the go to guy if Hollywood wants to revitalize a franchise, though he has yet to prove he can fuel an actual franchise by himself. As for Jack Black and Kevin Hart, both provide great comedy to an already comical The Rock. However, Kevin Hart's character is more interesting than Black's and therefore wins the crown for best comical character in the movie. Karen Gillan is stunning, and kicks ass, though she is not given much else to do. The movie has great sweeping shots, and over the top action, but all of this makes the movie plausible, given the premise that the characters are trapped in a game world. Recommended for all to watch",2017
3,"What a waste of my time and money.
I should've trusted my instincts about the trailer and clips to not to set foot in the cinema watching this crap.
Unfunny recycled jokes, lame story and kindergarden level villain.
Jumanji suppose to be exciting, emotional, funny and a little scary, but this movie failed to achieve none of it.
The screenwriters probably wrote the script in the bathroom on toilet paper and forgot to wipe with it their ass.
 
Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are from now on my official kryptonite. Arnold S. had more charisma than both of them together.
Even Jack Black who I dig, gave a goosebumps level performance.",2018

There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.",2017
1,Was this movie a crappy comedy? Why so many people liked it so much? What was this movie about? What was the purpose of all the jokes? Is this only for kids?,2017
8,"Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.",2017
1,"Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...",2017
8,The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against the Hulk his former ally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home and the Asgardian civilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had to say that because it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say that to me the story was really well told and really well paced which is to be expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.,2017
10,"Real or not this movie is one hell of a journey! The story is truly serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ne ""Revengers"" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. ",2017
10,"Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.",2017
1,"If the movie can't be serious about an apocalypse and just goofs around in nearly every scene then its certainly the murder of Thor as we have seen in comics. One cannot emotionally connect to absolutely anything, death of Odin or Thor losing an eye or destruction of Mjolnir or extinction of Aasgard as we know it. Movie is perfect example of killing the plot with over use of humor, jokes is on us.",2017

What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.",2017

The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.",2017
1,"A little goofiness is OK. But Thor has too much of it. Was expecting an Epic, Action filled, dramatic Thor film, not a silly space comedy. And it ain't that funny also. Not like Guardians or even Ant Man. Those are funny and well made. This one is a train wreck. The weakest movie of the MCU so far. It's a bad joke. The characters had so much potential, but everything was wrong. Bad acting, Bad jokes, Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum being certainly the worst. Odin's scenes were horrendous. What a mess. No emotions, no story background. Feels like a rushed product, made by a cinema first year student. The previous Thor movies were so majestic and dramatic. This one looks like a bad B movie with great CGI. No serious Thor or Marvel fan will think this movie is good or fun. So Disappointed. Waste of money. Awful.",2017

Thor is a very charismatic character, yet marvel turn he into a comedy mess As for hulk, a talking green giant eh? too much talking. and above all that mess, Thor help destroying Asgard!! let me get this clear again if you don't get it... THOR help destroying ASGARD!!",2017
1,"Probably one of the worst movies I've ever paid to watch. Plot was predictable and corny and Hulk was an unnecessary addition to an already poorly written cast.

If you're under the age of 10 or like poorly written movies then this is for you.",2017
8,"After actually being quite a fan of the previous Thor movies, I was incredibly excited to hear that Kiwi, Taika Waititi would be directing this as his previous films, 'Boy', 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' were just amazing and incredible works of fiction. This film did not disappoint though it did lack in certain areas. Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor Odinson along with Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner although I thought we could've seen more Bruce then Hulk. Tom Hiddleston is living it up as Loki and gives yet another great performance as The God of Mischief. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban and Idris Elba are all fine members of the supporting cast and I actually really enjoyed Urban's English accent and his character in general. Elba is just badass in every sense of the word. Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel House, Clancy Brown, Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth also gave great supporting performances. Props to Taika for bringing in Rachel House his long time friend into this role and she had some great moments. The cameos of Hemsworth, Neill and Damon were just incredible. The humour is just sidesplitting and has Taika written all over it. The action was actually very good considering the Director's lack of experience and The Valkyrie sequence was just visually stunning. The story was simple and easy to follow, the film flowed really well and it was just really really enjoyable. ",2017

8,"When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they're stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role's vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn't extend to properly exploring what he's been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).",2017
8,"This movie is really epic. It's a visually stunning film. Everything from the visual effect to the costume and production design are all amazing. The battle scenes are very impressive and thrilling. The acting is good but the supporting characters should have more on screen time, especially Hela, who mostly appear in battle scenes. Hope she's still alive and will return in the future because she has potential to become a great villain. Thor is actually cooler with his new hair and without his hammer. He's also more powerful. I love the soundtrack. Together with the production design, it feels like an 8-bit game. The story is great though it's not better than other good MCU film. But the directing makes it more impressive. The jokes are very funny. I was a bit disappointed that Doctor Strange doesn't have more important role in this film. The opening introduced everything a little bit too quickly. Overall, this is a very unique MCU film. You'll like it.",2017
8,"Honestly i LOVED IT!!! The action and comedy combination is truly fantastic. Thanks to Taika for the formula of this movie. The first Thor and the second is slightly disappointed but with this third movie, i must said civil war beaten by this movie.",2017
9,"Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",2017
9,"I mean seriously, no kidding! that breathtaking opening action scene, that exhilarating fight scene between Thor and Hulk on the arena, those countless hilarious scenes that literally made me laugh out loud (seriously!), that touching moment with Odin, that sad but satisfying ending, that shocking first post-credit scene, and the list goes on and on and on made this movie the greatest, the most epic, and the most awesome superhero movie of the year! (whether or not ""Justice League"" could live up to that title, I guess we'll never know until November the 17th arrives) ",2017
10,"I, for one.... can not Believe the reviews I have read. It is totally unfathomable that people have such narrow minds. First off. It is a television show. Nothing more People! It is a refreshing insight to all that autistic children, adults face on a daily basis. It is thoughts of what is possible for ANYONE with any type of disability they may face to have a positive outlook for what they stand for and fight for at any given time in their life. Although, it is extreme... It is the possibility that something greater can happen in the life of someone with disabilities no matter how great or small. I find a learning experience in every episode I have watched and that is to learn more about autism from every aspect and have compassion enough to care ... as a human being. I would be very sad if this show doesn't continue and show it's full potential. I will be forever watching as long as it is aired!",2017
10,To Pberry-17501 I disagree with your review and i find it rather an insult .there are different types of autism .your going by your personal experience with your son ..autism affects people in different ways and if an autistic child takes an interest in something with encouragement they can be and do anything they want ..This program for instance is an example ..my brother and my self have autism my brother was a gymnast and i am self employed with a successful business ..you obviously don't understand your son and have never encouraged him as we where by our loving family ..anything is possible this is a brilliant series and i hope it gets another season ..part of autism is determination to see something through..I don't like is people comparing his character or expecting him to go all norman bates ..Autism in this day and age is looked at as incompetent ..well if you see us as been not the norm then i would ask what is normal ..people can be cruel and i have ran into situations where people think i am slow ..,2017
10,"I am loving this show, more than once it has made me cry! When one episode finishes I am already checking what the following week is going to be about. It is brilliant and Freddie as Dr Shaun Murphy is amazing. Initially I thought I would only care about Dr Shaun, but weirdly they have all kind of grown on me and I am interested in the back stories too.",2017
10,"I am an intelligent high school student who is very socially awkward and introverted. My life goal is to become a doctor and work at a hospital, and save lives. I can relate to Shaun as a character, but I also love the subplots and story lines that the flashbacks reveal, and this was the first show ever to genuinely make me cry. I love this show, and would love to see it grow and develop, along with the characters and the plots.",2017
10,"Just wanted to say, that me and my family look forward to Monday nights to watch The Good Doctor. My husband and I grew up in the Doogie Howser MD years and think this series is even better than that. Great scenarios, great story lines, great acting. Absolutely love the show and actors. Looking forward to more seasons of The Good Doctor. Thank you!",2017
5,"Anyone who thinks Freddie Highmore can't carry this show is woefully unknowledgeable about actors. He most certainly can. Whether he will get the writing that the show needs remains to be seen. So far, it's a mostly a collection of clichés. However, that may be what is necessary to launch the concept. For Freddie, the role is a risk, not because he can't deliver, but because the character can easily become too close to Norman Bates. Comparing this show to House MD is very unfair. While both of the doctors are oddballs, that's where the comparison ends. House was an SOB who didn't suffer fools gladly. Shaun Murphy's autism colors everything; he can't always control it. When House was out of control, it was because he wanted to be. It remains to be seen whether David Shore can deliver the scripts that Freddie will need. Stay tuned.",2017
3,Just finished the first episode and to be honest I think it's going to be a show full of clichés that people have already seen in other similar shows. ,2017
4,"I was intrigued by the premise this show presents. But it is just a slight twist on the same old hospital drama, and not enough to make me want to watch it regularly. I gave up on medical shows after about 3 seasons of Gray's Anatomy, and never went back. So the main character will be bullied by the rest of the staff, but he will show them how brilliantly smart he is.",2017
10,The Good Doctor is so amazing and inspiring! The show carries a beautiful positive message. Telling us no matter how hard life can be there's always something to be happy about. We need more TV shows like This Good Doctor. ,2017
10,The Good Doctor TV show is totally now my number one favorite! I hope it's around for a hundred season's! Freddie Highmore is an excellent actor! All the actors and actresses are great but Freddie is my favorite! I was so sad when Bates Motel ended and I'm so happy this show was born! Love the story line of this fine young doctor with the disease Savant Syndrome and I like the projection of his medical knowledge figuring out the medical diagnosis with the patient and the reflecting of the memories of his past. This show is an inspiration to all!,2017
6,"David Shore is widely acknowledged as the genius, the artiste, behind HOUSE, arguably one of the best TV shows of the last half-century. The good news is that Shore is back in the saddle with another medical show about another doctor with exceptional skills. The bad news is that this show, while it has its moments, does not quite tick on all cylinders.",2017
7,"I was intrigued by the trailers that were released over the summer having enjoyed quite a few of David Shore's series over the years and very much became a fan of Freddie Highmore on Bates Motel. I tempered my expectations though because it's pretty difficult to create a series as successful as House was, being not just one of my all time favourite shows but probably one of the best series on television in the last 25 years. I was honestly unaware, until reading the reviews, that it was based off of a South Korean series. Some of the same formula is trying to be used between House and this show though, with the not typical doctor and being a ""misunderstood genius"". However quite different though in comparing a damaged, narcissistic, self destructive, middle aged specialist to an autistic, young resident. There's certainly some parts that don't quite add up in The Good Doctor though and are things that I hope get worked out as the series progresses. I would be in agreement with many other reviewers in that Shaun seems to have more Asperger's Syndrome than being a high functioning autistic savant though. There are certainly some shared things between the two but there are just some aspects that would not be considered realistic if he were truly autistic. That being said, it's nice to see more autistic characters on TV and showing that you can be on the spectrum and do great things. Freddie Highmore plays the part quite well though and at this point is really the reason I'm continuing to watch to see where this goes. There's a lot of flatness to the rest of the characters at this point though. Most meet the typical medical drama stereotypes with the arrogant, bit of a jackass team lead surgeon, one team member that's a little too confident and is willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead and another that is the opposite, and of course they just happen to be sleeping together. There's the one administrator who is willing to put their career on the line for someone they fully believe in no matter what, another who does what he can to take that persons job for a variety of motives and a room full of yes men. So yeah, the medical drama formula is certainly in full effect on that front. I hope to see more of Carly as it goes forward. I always liked Jasika Nicole from her days as Astrid on Fringe, and in the couple of episodes she's been in she seems to be the one who's most kind and understanding of Shaun and finds a way to best work with his social difficulties. All in all there's some cheesiness at times and it's not totally realistic but few network dramas are and that always has to be kept in mind. It's not a great show but so far it's good and I just hope it can take that extra step forward to make it great. It's yet to be seen if Shore can pull another show off that's even half as good as House but with him as the creator and a wonderful young actor in Highmore there's hope.",2017
7,Watching the first episode I was struck by how unbelievable the scenario was and how patronising it is to the audience. ,2017
1,"This show is terrible. I am only 2 episodes in, but the show is so unbelievable it is like an autistic person wrote it. What I mean by that is the characters do not interact with each other in a way that reflects how humans normally interact with each other and not just the character that actually is autistic in the show. The conversations all the characters have and decisions they make do not match what a real life version of them would do.. Let me give you some examples. In the first episode, the CEO of the hospital decides to higher the autistic doctor. Some of the other doctors are skeptical and push back. They don't really make any great points why he cant be a doctor other than suggesting he will be too socially retarded and it doesn't even really get that heated. After 1 failed attempt of convincing them that it was as good decision the CEO starts shouting out some high-road speech and says if the autistic guy doesn't work out he will resign from his position. Not only was it unnecessary for him to get that heated from such little push back no CEO would ever put their job on the line for something that silly. It was totally unnecessary. What I imagine would really happen is he would just assert his dominance saying it was his job to make the decision and he stands behind it.",2017
5,"I watched the first episode and it was very underwhelming. On a side, I'm wondering why people are only interested in aspects of autism, if the autistic person has savant syndrome. You don't hear about shows that's main focus is on high functioning and lower functioning autism that isn't the stereotypical ""rain man"" savant syndrome. Honestly, I enjoyed the flashbacks more than the present day, that would have been a great plot for the show. His journey with his brother and becoming a doctor. I feel there was more depth and unique storytelling in those flashbacks than another House, M.D 2.0. Because the directors and producers created House, it's really hard to not compare the two in terms of plot patterns and diagnostic imagery. Overall, I'm disappointed that it wasn't a unique plot, but I think Freddie Highmore is a great actor, so he'll definitely carry the show.",2017
1,"Was forced to watch this at work. Hated it immediately. How could this guy get into medical school, even college, graduate from there and still face intense scrutiny about being hired? Do hospital boards really get together and debate the hiring of residents for long periods of time? None of his professors were asked to vet the guy? This guy has never worked in the field a day, yet lectures doctors who have worked for years like they are complete idiots? Are all doctors young and beautiful with impeccable hairstyles? We all know that's not true. A boy gets hurt in an airport but Murphey and the doctor have what seems like an hour to work on the guy like there are no working EMT's at or near the airport? ",2017
1,"An autistic savant could not possibly handle the pressures of a hospital, let alone surgery. I know we're starting to understand (albeit to a certain extent), more about autism, but the premise of this show? No way. I've worked in hospitals, and no way would this happen. This is from the same people who brought us ""House"", about a drug addicted doctor and everyone seemed to know he was an addict. In real life, his colleagues would not have provided him drugs or covered for him. ( I knew a nurse who lost her job due to drug addiction.",2017

Theyhave this guy not only rushing in to save people, but taking the initiative and communicating with everyone else on the show. Maybe they should h hire an autistic actor to play the part. Oh yeah, there are no autistic actors. You are giving people the impression that autisum is a small social problem that can be overcome with an excellent memory.It's bad enough people think autistic children are all prodigies at something, please stop spreading the myth.",2017
4,"This has a premise that has elements of Doogie Howser: a brilliant and very young doctor. Then it adds autism and savant qualities to the title character: Good Dr Shaun Murphy, portrayed by Freddie Highmore. Freddie just came off 5 seasons of playing a young version of Norman Bates. I will have to see more of what he brings to Dr Murphy before I can disassociate him from Bates Motel. His initial screen time looked and sounded a lot like young Norman. And now they are putting a scalpel in his hand? I kept waiting for the creepy background music to begin. The rest of the cast did not have any characters that stood out. They were mostly a potpourri of standard hospital denizens that are there primarily to support the lead character. I realize it takes time to develop the complex chemistry of a truly fine ensemble cast. But, without that a TV show like this gets dull very quickly. And Freddie does not have skill or charisma it takes to carry the load of being the principle focus of most episodes. Properly handled, with good scripts and a cast that brings a strong sense of reality to the plots, this has a chance to be around for a while. Otherwise, it will quickly fade away and end up in the bin full of wannabe TV series.",2017

Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing.

But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.",2017

Specifically b/c the three billboards pose a question to another character (Harrelson) and he answers that question to the protagonist(McDormand) within the first 10 minutes of the movie. His answer to the question on the billboards is completely reasonable, but of course the protagonist isn't satisfied. Short of a few comical lines, the movie isn't funny. Also, there are no characters to root for throughout the movie. In addition to all the characters being either racist, hateful, or stupid (all three?), the main character is unlikable, and that is also stated later in the movie. The one good part of the movie is the realization by the protagonist that they are selfish person who is actually doing everything for them self and hurting everyone else around them b/c they are miserable. The ending is also bad and is not really an ending.",2017
7,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline. But the conclusion of ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is indeed a cliffhanger usually used in TV series or films written for franchise or at least a sequence. My vote is seven.",2018

I am a huge Frances McDormand fan (and appreciate her performance here) so I'm very reluctant to infer that all this nastiness was intentional, but I don't know how to make sense of it.

1,SPOILERS!,2017
1,"The whole way through I realized that this film isn't full of racist characters, the film is just racist. The way the man that was pasting up the billboards spoke to the cop who ""tortured people of color"" (what was that scene all about BTW?) - was completely tone deaf to how Black people have to interact with the police, especially overtly racist ones! It just seemed a masturbatory way for the writer/director to create a false reality where he can exercise his white-guilt about cops torturing Black people. That same character comes up later with the replacement billboards like some magical hero who was ""always on the right side"" (because Black people hate cops I guess?) that only exists to be a servant to Mildred. Her friend in the store, Denise, is only there as a tool for the audience/Mildred to be angry at the cops but has absolutely no depth herself. And the new Chief is, again, only an extension of the writer's enormous White guilt. For such a racist White town, that doesn't seemed to be bothered about a cop that tortures Black people, it seems that no one is bothered by a new Black Chief - who has come to no protest by the people and conveniently fixes racism within the police force by firing the one racist. (Woody Harrelson's line about if you fired every racist cop you'd just have three that hated fags is an insane apologist stance too.) In fact, this new chief is such a ""good guy,"" (I hate to say it because it's so gross, but what a classic example of an Uncle Tom) that he forgives and overlooks Mildred who blew up a police station and attempted to murder someone. These character's Blackness only exists to serve Mildred, it's flimsy and exploitative. Also, that monologue about the Catholic church is nauseating - she defends a racist law created to throw as many Black people in prison as possible and relates it to child molestation in the church (also, throws in homosexuality as an equivalent to pedophilia) which is supposed to be a ""you-go-girl"" moment but ultimately you can't side with her because the priest is the only character in the film that was there for the son. I read a quote from the writer/director that Mildred is an antihero which may explain that last scene but... what the f***? Your protagonist is a woman demanding that the police find the man that raped and murdered her daughter and decided that she is going to be an antihero???? She's not liked by the town for being zealous and she's not liked by the audience for everything else... It takes sharp turns from comedy to drama, cutting both aspects short at the wrong times with none of the humor in the antihero aspect - it's an excuse to have a woman in a revenge role to say that it's a film with a woman in a revenge role... taking notes from the Coen Brothers, Tarantino, Ritchie, and Twin Peaks but missing all of those marks by miles. Not a single female character, not one, had any depth. The ex-husband's new girlfriend for one, was a cartoon based on women being complete morons. Almost all the characters had some sense of being real people but then they throw in a character as comedic relief and the joke is ""women are horrendously stupid."" Even Mildred is a one note story, she's an angry, bitter mother. Her character arch was completely neutered to fulfill the character arch of the antagonist, a racist who read a letter and is all better now. The second half of the film is just a way to apologize for officer Dixon's wrong-doings - some White male guilt fantasy that he can be redeemed of all of his sins if you just gave the poor guy a chance. That's who the story serves in the end, it IS NOT ABOUT a grieving mother that wants answers, it's not about a child getting raped and murdered, those are just points added in to ultimately give redemption to the wrong doings of white men in power and absolve the writer/director of whatever sins of his own I'm sure he's working through in this film. I even read a quote that he was happy this film was being released among the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment wave as this film is a place for that anger... wow. Also... The Dwarf character was just used as the butt of what felt like 100 jokes and his redemption is some after school special line about ""you judge me for looking different, but look at you"" - that character is an adult, why is he consistently trying to date Mildred and cover for her? (hint: to make the audience feel better about laughing at endless midget jokes when he gets the final word.) Then the rapist who murdered someone in some ""Sandy country"" (-_-) is drawn as simple as some of the women in this film. I guess the writer/director is claiming that - it's not war that brings out the worst in people - some people rape and kill and brag about it to their buddies over a drink with no signs of PTSD, shame, guilt. PTSD would not justify rape and murder, but it is an extension of ""people can do good if they just changed their minds"" that we saw with Officer Dixon. (Maybe there will be a sequel where the rapist says he's sorry and spends the rest of the film teaching Black kids how to play basketball. Seems like a fit continuation for this confused film.) Too many false endings too with no real good conclusion other than, again, to serve as a nice pillow for the redemption of officer Dixon to rest on.

5,"The other negative reviews cite this movie of a Coen Bros. ripoff. I'm not ready to be that harsh, but there is certainly an element of a cloning attempt here. The big problem is it tries to hard to be quirky, offbeat and irreverent, but at the same time attempts to wedge some pathos in here and there to balance it out. It just... fails. One problem is-- and curse me for saying this-- the movie is too short. It's as if there was a time limit on character development-- make a few comments and now it's up to you to see the big picture. Call a man a racist, and you're given the job of applying this assumption to everything a character does stems from this. Give a man cancer, and now you're job is to apply sympathy to his actions. An extra half hour would give both the director and the audience room to come to a better understanding of what lurks beneath, what drives the character's behavior. I'm trying to avoid a spoiler, but the last conversation Mildred has with her daughter is a perfect summation of what is really lacking in this movie. If you see it-- which I'm not saying you shouldn't-- you'll know exactly what I mean. I'd wait for the post-theater release.",2017
4,"Disappointed. After seeing an 8.5 star rating I was so excited to see this movie.....and I wanted to see it quickly before I heard or read too many spoilers. In my opinion, ratings that high are reserved for movies like Forrest Gump, Titanic, Shawshank and Good Fellas so I really went into this with high expectations. This movie did proceed along quickly with enough twists and humor to keep you interested but it is so far fetched that it becomes stupid. The police are portrayed like characters from The Dukes of Hazzard so you just roll your eyes every time they talk. Then they get away with criminal acts with no recourse much like detectives in Lethal Weapon. Shoot your gun, kill people, break the law.....do what you want, after all, you're the police....right? This is truly a 4 star movie. You may not hate watching it but it is in no way a must see. As mentioned in many reviews the acting by Frances and Woody is very, very good and you can't help but love the resolve of the main character who is willing to stand up for what she is trying to accomplish as well as the pain Woody is going through in his life. But again, you just can't ignore the foolish scenes that occur. Ever seen a western where a guy shoots his gun 45 times without reloading? Or better yet a movie where the hero shoots 6 times and kills 6 bad guys all who had automatic weapons and were firing back at him.....Need a fire extinguisher?....Her's a 50 gallon one in the front seat of my car. It's those kind of occurrences that happen throughout the movie that make you say ""oh come on"" about 7-8 times throughout the movie. The most unfortunate thing about this movie is that those scenes were not necessary. It had enough going for it that a more realistic approach could have bumped this up to a much higher rating.",2017
6,"After hearing a lot of praise and having been fond of the cast, I thought this would be a slam dunk for me, but I left disappointed. I will keep this review concise and sweet.",2017
7,"12/3/17. I got a free ticket to see this but I wasn't sure if I would like it. That's because in recent years McDormand has been playing the bitter older woman,unhappy with life. However, she was a surprise in this. Though she continued in the vein of the unhappy older woman she is somewhat subdued in her anger over the stalled investigation into her teen daughter's death. However, she has enough anger to launch a publicity campaign against the police department, in particular, the police chief who has his own health issues to deal with. The film is basically a slice of life of small town USA and does not paint a very pretty picture of small town living. Worth catching.",2017
2,"The Klingons do not look like Klingons, and when given a chance to throw us a bone of a real Klingon they failed. The Klingon ships don't look Klingon...or anything else. Absolutely shapeless.

1,"The casting is wrong. The camera work is terrible. The writing does not exist because the dialogue is horrible. The Klingons should feel like pirates who love life, battle and debauchery-in other words anything their senses tell them feels good-instead they make them into some hybrid Egyptian Hierarchy. If it's pre-Kirk why is the technology better? It looks better. The music is also nonexistent. How can you make Star Trek and have no music? There are two people who should have been at the top of the list to run this show J. Micheal Strazynski and/or John Byrne. I can't believe they have the nerve to ask me to pay for the second episode. Gene would not have approved and I certainly do not. Vulcan are logical not dullards. Study the original series. That's the feeling you want to achieve. I cannot say how much I loathe this reboot. This is not Star Trek.",2017

3,"For a Star Trek series there's way too much improbability and inconsistency in the Star Trek lore. This series is set after Enterprise, but before TOS. The USS Discovery (and other federation vessels) are far too advanced for the time this series is set to take place in. A Spore drive, really? Why has there never been any reference to Spore drives in previous series? Okay, I get that visuals, etc. required an upgrade in this age of special effects and modern technologies, but then the series should've be set much further in the future. That at least would've been possible.",2017

It is NOT canon, despite what CBS is trying to push. There is nothing canon in this show. There are no Klingons (just some ridiculous weirdos who look like a cross between the Jem'Hadar and Enemy Mine - except the Jem'Hadar were cool, and Enemy Mine was awesome). The behaviour of that dreadful Soniqua creature would never be tolerated in Starfleet - in fact the behaviour of nearly all the characters would never be tolerated in Starfleet. The uniforms are a dead match for the Chilean Soccer team, and the whole presentation is just truly awful. The attitude and behaviour of Jason Isaacs (whom I used to admire) is appalling, and he has lost a fan. NOT Trek. CBS has failed miserably.",2017

2,Know your audience. For crying out loud! I'm guessing that the notion of 'how far can we take it' was thrown around the writers room.

I expect heads will roll if the audience drops off.,2017

Bad acting and bad story lines makes this show anything but Star Trek! What a waste of resources! Just simply remove the main character from the show and see what a huge difference it would make. Send her back to zombies. If she might have been good in that show, it does not mean she would be good in another show. I kept giving it another chance hoping it might get better. But it did't. It is time to stop watching it .\/. DON'T RUIN A CLASSIC SHOW FOR THE REST OF US!",2017
1,"This is the opposite of star trek. It is a dystopian nightmare, but the most terrifying part is the main character Michael Burnham. I would feel embarrassed for her because of her self-pitying childish dumbness even if she wasn't raised by Vulcans. Discovery is nothing more than a bad clone of The Expanse. The story is dark, but weak and the characters are uninteresting and unbelievable. But sci-fi was always more a mirror of the present than an outlook into the future...",2017
1,"I'm going to rate this in two parts and I tried my best to approach it with an open mind but seven episodes in nothing has got any better. As Star Trek: It's just bad, CBS claimed it was prime timeline. That's a flat out lie, it's a reboot at best. The continuity is completely off. The set design looks like it belongs from 200 later than Voyager. Obviously it's not practical to make the sets look like the 60s ones but Enterprise did a beautiful job of looking like it fitted into its era. All these wide angle flares and massive shiny bridges just do not fit. Onto the Klingons. I'm going to ignore the appearance issue and focus on the glaring continuity issues. Klingons believe the dead body is an empty husk, they don't collect the deal and nail them to their ships. It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. They sound terrible and quite frankly boring. There is no passion in anything they say. It's like whoever is directing them has never actually seen Trek. And the spore drive is just a dumb idea. It's not in the slightest bit Trek and the more I watch the show the more I think that someone leaned on the Scifi network to cancel Dark Matter just so they wouldn't have the same ""blink"" drive. the worst thing though is the acting and the plots. Yes actors need time to find their feet in new rolls but so much of it is cringe worthy you wonder if they have ever appeared on TV before. The plots are absurd and fit in with very little of what is known of the Trek universe. I would hypothesise that the writers have watched the new films and that's probably it.",2017

Did they ever bother watching prior ST series or movies? And then, to top it off, CBS expects people to pay $10 a month to watch this online? Not a chance. I love the Trek universe, but this thing belongs in some alternate reality.",2017
4,"I have been waiting a very long time for a new Star Trek series, and I decided I would try to watch Discovery with an open mind, accepting the fact that this new series will likely aim to entice a new audience. I accepted it would need to be a little different and modernised from the classic Trek of the 90s that I'm used to, so I went in with this in mind.",2017
1,"Could have been a lot better then it was. I'm a Trekkie since I was a kid so I was looking forward to this show for a long time. I know they wanted to go in different direction but they went to far this time from what I saw tonight. I don't care about who is playing what in the show, if your good at acting and the story is good then it will be good. In this case the acting was meh, not bad but not close to being great and the story was not wow considering how many delays and how long they had to write it. It is way too dark and doesn't jive with any other Star Trek series before it. If they really thought about it better they should have said it is taking place in the kelvin time line and set it after the events of the rebooted movies, but they didn't so they messed up there.",2017

From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense.

I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.",2017

Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.",2018

It is a fun musical, very well done and enjoyable.If it was a made up story about John G. Pigglestack, then the critics would have nothing to complain about.

It was moving, upbeat, and romantic. Can't say enough good things about it. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and Zendaya are all so talented. Go see it in the theater to really appreciate how magical this movie is.",2017

They had something to say. Makes me sad to see so many missed the message of this very important movie, just because it was wrapped up in a fun experience.

I'll even admit that I broke the cardinal rule and actually turned on my cell phone to download the the ENTIRE soundtrack while still in the theater...and I was only two songs in!! I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself!

Also, bought the Soundtrack too. Two Thumbs Up.",2018
10,"I loved this movie. I have already pre-ordered the blue ray and I am planning to see the movie again in the theatre. I am writing a review mainly because I am so annoyed by all of the negative reviews by the critics. One point was that it is not completely accurate to how P. T. Barnum was. Well it is a musical, not a documentary. It still was a well written story. One critic complained that the movie turned Barnum into a saint. Not true! He was flawed in the movie, at times uncaring or selfish. The scenes of the circus were just amazing. The choreography was very well done. The songs also are excellent and performed by very talented singers. Listen to the songs on youtube. Try ""Never Enough"" and ""The Greatest Showman."" The movie also shows the importance of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. The songs are very catchy, and will stay in your head, and the movie is uplifting. This movie was Hugh Jackman's dream, it took 7.5 years to make. Each actor held their own and fit well into their role. This movie has so much talent and effort put into it and deserves to become a classic.",2017

The acting is brilliant, the storyline is fantastic & the music is utterly superb. Feel like I could rewatch it 20 more times & not get bored. Hugh Jackman is at his very best as are Zac Efron & Zendaya. True masterpiece. Must see!",2018
10,"I think critics are missing the whole premise of the film. I never really saw this as a biography to begin with, but a fun, upbeat historical fiction musical. Each musical number had a fitting mood for the scene, especially the opening number where it was especially satisfying to see the visual aspects of the film. I saw this film as a mixture of the pop-style mood of Hamilton, mixed with the visual joyride that was Pippin. It works for me perfectly. I never really felt the runtime at all because the musical parts of the show were enough to keep me satisfied. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman definitely brought my favorite performances, with Waitress actress Keala Settle delivering some satisfying vocal delivery. You can definitely feel the La La Land levels of genius lyrics here. As for story, I found myself telling the characters ""NO DON'T DO THAT"" or ""YESSS"" very softly in the theater. There were even a few moments where I smiled and laughed out loud.
In the words of Rachel Bloom, ""the modern musical is an American invention, and it is still alive and well."" It's rare that we get to see wonderfully crafted theatrical musicals such as this and La La Land. This is also something I think many critics fail to see. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.",2017

Sure there are some gaps in the story telling, but who cares. This movie is visually amazing, the songs are incredible, the performances are perfect. Especially props to Zendaya, who seems to be on the verge of superstardom. She can sing, act, dance and is about as beautiful as a person can be! I may do the unthinkable and go see this one again!",2018

The talent was top notch and the story line was appealing to all ages. Sure this is a clean family film, but it doesn't make it any less artsy or enjoyable than those with an adult rating. I looked up the actual history of P.T. Barnum, and this movie wasn't far off from the basic story of his life. Sure they added drama to the story, but I don't even care. It's not like this was a pivotal story in World History. He was an entertainer, and guess what, a movie in his name just got made that was completely entertaining. I'm sure he'd be pleased with the end result. I am not one to see movies twice, but I'm sure I will. My husband and I went to the late showing last night and I will likely go again this week with my daughters and their friends. Is there anything Hugh Jackman can't do? Clearly there is not!! I would see this on the big screen with the full sound effects, and I'd probably plan on seeing it in theaters twice if I were you.",2017

9,I'm not much for musicals but love the history of the circus which we no longer have because of political correctness. Anyway I really enjoyed this movie. I'm sure historians can find fault and the dance numbers obviously are more in tune with these days than the early 1900's. My favorite Jackman part sorry Wolverine fantastic comic fans but he was very good. The whole cast was enjoyable and there is a nice message in the movie as well about accepting who you are and never mind the upper class snobs. Just go see it and enjoy!!!,2017
