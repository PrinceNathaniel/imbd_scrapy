"This used to be my favorite of the L&O franchise, until Stabler left. The last several seasons have done nothing but shamelessly pander to a political agenda, rather than focus on engaging plots, as they once did. It's regrettable that this show has become such a disappointment. It feels like I'm watching a sinking ship.",5,2017
"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the ""good cop, bad cop"" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled ""Rage,"" and ""Rooftop"". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on ""Law & Order"" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called ""Coerced."" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10",10,2005
"I started out liking this. But by season 5, it started to go very idiotic and on a warpath against religion. It is also full of ridiculous lines and plots.",1,2016
"I watched every episode of law and order, the makers of this show gives too much credit too mariska hargitay when meloni was in the show she pulled herself up but now al the show centeres around this bad actress the rest is pulling down also pls cut down her screen time she is really bad making the show bad, munch has been kicked off the show i liked that man with his conspiracy theori ice t ain't getting a real part the new ones they just don't kick it This show has so many potential but not with mariska the good interaction has gone away and i do not like to watch to the old and fully botoxed face with no expression on it get some new fresh good actors and write again don't write just read the news like u used to do but do something",6,2013
"This show used to be OK, but over the last couple of years it has lost the plot. It demonizes all men. It portrays men as abusers, and women as victims. This is not the real world. Instead of a balance in drama that reflects our world, it's nothing more than ratings hype. My family are about to stop watching this show.",2,2011
"In the dictionary of American TV jargon, this show is featured next to the phrase, ""Jumped the shark"". Here's why:",1,2010
"In the past I liked it often, with the New York dark side and continuous relevant references, though of course solving every crime with the right culprit was always hard to bare. But now I'd say please ignore the worst police shows ever.",1,2015
All of the other Law & Order shows have had realistic cast changes except this one. It is the same old same old. Benson and Stabler go running around and grab the wrong person. Benson always looks like she smells rotten fish and Stabler roughs up the suspect. They catch the wrong person within the first 15 minutes and then the real person strikes again. Benson stands slack jawed with her tongue poking out of her mouth and Stabler looks insulted that he arrested the wrong person.,1,2008
"I just finished watching ""Turmoil"" and I am aghast that those two have not been drummed out by the IAD. That squad has lost more detectives to ""bad"" behavior yet Stabler, especially him, continues to lose his mind and all manner of control in every situation, make terrible judgment calls and is basically a ticking time bomb every week. And can we figure out how to write some kind of dialogue that is appropriate to the job? Calling child rapists scumbags went the way of NYPD Blue and grossly inadequate. And can we stop nominating Mariska Hartigay for Emmys and Golden Globes? She's got only one expression that she uses for when she's confused by the evidence, taking a witness statement or placating ""El"" when he's gone off the deep end. I don't know why I continue to watch this freaking show. This is has gone the way of CSI:Miami. Straight up parody.",1,2009
"I still do not like the character of Olivia Benson being in charge of SVU as she is not good at it at all as she strictly is all for the females every time as far as victims go but then she doesn't trust or get totally along with Rollins maybe she sees her as a threat or something because Rollins sees & hears both sides males & females. They need to bring in somebody else to be in charge of SVU & bust Benson back down to just being a detective. The last & latest episode I'm on the fence or almost over the fence because the ""victim"" liked the guy when she first seen him telling her cousin he is hot & then the whole bathroom scene & other witnesses from the party said she was all over him even as they went outside. I do not think it warrants rape. Also in this episode Benson makes it sound like before we have sex every time we have to ask permission & wait for a firm definitive yes or no whether it's our wife or girlfriend or whomever & that way off point & wrong. Rape is or should be when somebody says no or is fighting you off while at the same time the perp doesn't care what the female is saying & forces it on her anyway.",10,2016
"The acting is haphazard, the characters are one dimensional and loathsome, and the writing is predictable and trashy. I hate this show so much, the only reason I joined IMDb was to communicate to the world how odious this show is. Please, if it is remotely within your capacity, take this show off the air. If you have a positive view of the world, of humanity, the government, or the criminal justice system, do not watch this show. It not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear, but it also depicts public officials as sinister, self- righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified, it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show.",1,2011
"L&O: SVU is by far the worst of the L&O franchise, and one of the worst shows ever to appear on TV, any network, any language: ",1,2009
"Back when Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was truly an ensemble show, it was excellent. Each week would focus mostly on one character - the best episodes being the Munch-centric ones - showing us a case from beginning to end.",4,2010
"This film was absolutely incredible. Attempting to explain the plot in any way that would do it justice would be an excercise in futility, but let it be said that I see many, many movies, and in my lifetime, I have never seen a movie such as Being John Malkovitch.",10,1999
"Being John Malkovich leaves you astounded. What happened in that dark theater? Twist and turn, one thing more fantastical than the next, this movie is 100 % UNIQUE. Even the introduction and the setting of the film are outlandish to say the least. The movie develops quickly, plummetting viewers into the warped world it creates; while the surroundings are strange, they are presented without leaving the audience convinced and I found that my questions about Malkovich's mysterious portal, such as ""What happens if John Malkovich goes into his own portal?"", were answered.",10,1999
"Being John Malkovich (1999), the Spike Jonze's directorial debut, is an amazing film - hip, inventive, delightfully weird, incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists. Let's face it, that was a stroke of genius - to throw together the tragic medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer Craig Scwartzh (John Cusack) with the nimble fingers but out of work in ""today's wintry economic climate"", Elijah the Chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood, the surreal office that is located on the 7 1/2 store of a New York City office building and a floor is four feet high. Add Cameron Diaz (Craig's animals loving wife Lotte), completely unrecognizable, aging and balding Charlie Sheen, cynical and practical Maxine (Catherine Keener), who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her ""with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes"", and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor John Malkovich's brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels, to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of New Jersey Turnpike. This is just the beginning...Oh, and what John Horatio Malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain, you have to find out for yourself! What drug were Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze on?! Not even two hours long, the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain. ""Being John Malkovich"" is a fascinating and truly original film which I love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters (with the exception of Abelard and Heloise and Elijah the Chimp).",10,2007
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) ****,9,1999
"What does it feel like to be inside someone else's skin?  Some people find out in the highly imaginative `Being John Malkovich,' directed with style by Spike Jonze, and starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.  When out of work puppeteer Craig Schwartz (Cusack) gets a job as a file clerk on the `7 1/2' floor of an office building, it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm beyond the known.  One day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet; curious, he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor John Malkovich.  After fifteen minutes of seeing through Malkovich's eyes, and experiencing what the actor is experiencing, Craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  Unable to contain himself, he confides what has happened to him to Maxine (Catherine Keener), a woman who also works on 7 1/2.  Immediately, she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, and she convinces Craig that they should start a business:  `J.M. Inc.'  For two hundred dollars a pop, people can have the experience of a lifetime.",10,2000
"All hail Spike Jonze for he is a genius. Not content with being the undisputed king of music videos, he's set his sights on full-length-feature-films. One might imagine that the often surreal, always innovative humour of his short music promos might not transfer across to a much longer production  like hell. Being John Malkovich' is a fresh exciting stroke of genius.",10,2001
"Originality is one thing that I very much admire in cinema, and it's also the reason I rate Being John Malkovich so highly. Charlie Kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling, and it's definitely a major highlight of American cinema in the 1990's. Charlie Kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but if you want to see his best work - you need look no further than his first feature. Quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery, but I'm certainly glad that Kaufman did. The story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor, John Malkovich. After discovering this portal, puppeteer Craig Schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush, the beautiful Maxine Lund. Things start to get complicated when Craig's wife, Lottie, becomes involved and it turns out that Craig's not the only one with a crush on Maxine.",8,2005
"Though I had liked the few Spike Jonze music videos I've seen(Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" and the Beastie Boys one), I was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies, for, as we know, for every good MTV raised director(David Fincher), there are several bad ones(Michael Bay).  And this is truly a concept which could have gone either way.  But this is one of the most original, funny, and enjoyable movie experiences I've had this year. Every idea pays off in ways you don't expect, all four main actors do well cast against type, and it's awfully hard to pick who's the best(though I suspect John Malkovich will be remembered at Oscar time), the dialogue is great(""Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man!"" may be the best line of the year), and I can't think of another way to describe this except go see it now.",10,1999
"This is one film that has me completely torn.  On the one hand there is so much to admire about Being John Malkovich.  The film is rich with great performances, it is directed very well by a new comer, it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing John Malcovich have the guts to portray himself, or to parody himself is quite amazing.  But on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie.  It is slow, it doesn't really have a point and the only metaphors that I can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing, and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simply-----bad.  I really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically, critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an ""arty"" film like this one.  It is safe and obvious to critisize a film like Armageddon or Bone Collector but admitting that you didn't really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is.  But the one thing that I noticed when I read all of the reviews before I saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is, and that is because it isn't.  As I said, there is much to ""admire"" about Being John Malkovich, just not a lot to like.  But I will tell you what is good before I tell you what isn't.",6,1999
"The most original film to come out in ages! A film that has ""one-joke premise"" written all over it, but this film has about four dozen good jokes, each one brilliantly conceived and executed. Acted to perfection, beautifully written, directed by the insanely original and wild Spike Jonze, this is a great great film.",10,2000
"A prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before, does not make it a cinematic masterpiece.  Scuzzy puppeteer John Cusack and snide co-worker Catherine Keener discover a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (playing himself) in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it.  Marketed as a comedy, the film is inventive, most definitely original, but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes.  The strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another, incorporating lesbianism, spousal abuse and cults into the mix.  Events become more and more sinister, disturbing and serious during the running time.  Unfortunately, the main characters, including an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as Cusack's frumpy wife, are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them, and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom.  Keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer, but she is given limited notes to play.  Malkovich may be a good sport, but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here.  It is hard to recall Cusack ever being this unappealing.  Director Spike Jonze has definite potential, but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project.  Even the look of the film, with everything in drab blues and greys, is a downer.  For all of the hype, the film is an amazingly empty experience.",1,2002
"Strong reviews, a great cast, and an interesting premise made me rent this movie; an un-funny, demented, and just plain bad film made me wish I had never been born. How this movie can be lauded as a classic is beyond me. Quite frankly, the fact that it is such a cult classic makes me wonder if the end of western civilization is near.",1,2002
"Having read reviews and the basic idea of the movie, I really was looking forward to seeing this film. Little did I know it would be the worst movie I ever had the misfortune of paying to see. I guess what really made it awful was that it began with a great idea, but went nowhere with it. So many questions were left.",1,2001
This is the first film I've seen that's been so unbearable I've had to turn it off. ,1,2005
"I can't think of a whole lot I can say about this movie other than the fact that it is humorless, boring, and in one word, tripe. I felt after watching this movie that there were few instances that one could waste their time as much as this movie wastes time. The truly disturbing fact is that this movie was rated #50 on the top 250 of IMDB. This lessens my faith in mankind.",1,2000
"This is an insanely GREAT movie! Nothing has been attempted like this before, and it keeps coming up with surprises and ingenuity until the very end. I laughed with delight all the way through, even though the movie is intentionally, unrelentingly, disorienting and creepy.",10,1999
"Well, first of I want to make clear that I am a person who is not put off by out there concepts nor am I intellectually devoid. I only point this out as many people seem to think they could be the only reasons why a person could not enjoy this 'masterpiece'. I'm not going to say this film's awful, but I will say it's over rated. All the cast put in a good performance and I particularly enjoyed John Cusack as I usually do yet I felt cheated by this film. Firstly, the concept of delving into someone elses mind in some kind of voyeuristic power trip is nothing new, it has been explored in novels before today, and even video games i.e. Body Rides by Richard Laymon and the game Psychic Detective. I state this to show that the idea behind this film isn't so revolutionary as some may think. In Laymon's Body Rides a bracelet is used to go in the mind of others and, coincidentally, the main character in the story ultimately uses the bracelet to jump into somebody elses mind to escape death. And in Psychic Detective the main character can do the same merely by though. I'm not saying the stories are identical but they do share common ideas. Secondly, I just couldn't relate to the characters, I know they were supposed to be obnoxious but I ended up almost not giving a damn about them as a result of this. However, at this point, I must point out something that did touch me in this film, it was Cusack's character (Craig) who's fate was somewhat undeserved and I felt sympathy for him, his act showing that he did indeed love Maxine, and I also found the thought of Malkovich's daughter becoming the next vessel disturbing as, in essence, Lester/Malkovich/etc was stealing somebody's life. To sum up as a whole, the film did have points where I chuckled or felt something but I ultimately felt denied and I think people should allow other people to think that this film isn't as good as it has been made out to be. In my opinion, if a friend has it, borrow it and see for yourself but don't waste your money on a rental or a DVD, it's just not worth it. Even if you enjoy fringe cinema as I do, you will find no substance in this film to satisfy you, only a huge hollow space around which there is a thinly woven plot.",1,2000
"I think this movie is the product of being popular simply because it is odd. I read through some of the favorable reviews to see if I missed something - but apparently I didn't.  Granted, there are a few funny moments; however it quickly becomes too twisted.  The characters quickly engage in deviant behavior so far fetched, it is neither relatable nor enjoyable to watch. Rent something else.",4,2003
Rubbish...,1,2010
"I can honestly say I do not understand why anyone would like this film. It's incredibly strange and surreal, and some people like that, but even if one does, I can't imagine how one would not be bored out of one's skull by this intellect-impoverished movie.",1,2001
"What's original about it? The down-the-rabbit hole other world? Being in someone else's skin? The gender bending (and bending back again)? The movies have been doing these since the silents. This was so hyped for its originality that I was actually ticked when I saw the end-credits role. About as original as a Sears paint job, a cheeseburger, or a banana-peel gag. This movie was so mundane and so poorly done (except for Mr. Burwell's music and a few cool camera tricks at the end) that I wanted my money back. And I didn't even pay to see it! You want original? Rent Rope (the movie or just plain rope from a hardware store; either will provide far more fun).",1,2000
"Bizarre. That's the first word that came to my mind as I reflected on this film. Indeed the most common muttering that I heard among my friends with whom I was watching the film (who, I admit, had no idea what they were going to be watching and had never heard of the film) was: ""what the f**k??!!"" I kept my incredulity to myself, but I largely shared their sentiment. ",9,2006
"Being John Malkovich is an odd little dark comedy which is slightly open to interpretation, but deals with themes like identity, manipulation, sex, and neuroses. The acting is excellent - but nothing less should have been expected from this cast. The screenplay is also very good, as is the direction and editing. The film moves along at a comfortable pace, relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters, plot-line, action, or intellect.",8,2006
"I wanted to like this film. Aww heck, I wanted to love it. I'm a big fan of black comedies in general. I've followed Spike Jonzes career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz... Well let's just say that my feelings towards Cameron Diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual male's. So this should have been a slam dunk. I liked the concept of the film, the reviews were glowing, I was receptive, pumped and primed.",1,2001
"It may be a paradox to say that a film can sparkle slowly, yet that's the only way I can describe this charming romantic comedy. The star(dom)-crossed lovers don't know that they are Meant For Each Other ... yes, this is the standard RomCom setup. But the -way- they don't know? That is put across in a most British and deliberate pace and setting. And it makes the ending that we all know is coming gather color and charm.",10,2000
"Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. (My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.",7,2004
"Notting Hill proves one thing -- jokes lie in the oddest places.  This film is an excellent vehicle for Julia Roberts to put her own life as an actress under the microscope.  While Roberts' ""Anna Scott"" character isn't an autobiographical figure, the Scott character allows for some biting satire at the life of Roberts herself.  Need I mention some excellent one liners in the film like the sister of Hugh Grant... ""I feel like we are sisters"", an excellent throw-back to ""My Best Friend's Wedding""...  or my favourite, a discussion about nude body doubles just before a nude Julia Roberts (or a Julia Roberts body double) crosses the screen.",10,1999
"Visually lovely, ""Notting Hill"" becomes an enchanting fairy tale.....a magical and endearing love story, from the opening credits to an afternoon of quiet sharing in a London park.  Being a romantic at heart, I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture, enticing me to view it a number of times more.",10,2000
"Can lightning strike twice? Well with writer Richard Curtis it has! I understand he wrote this screenplay and completed it before he realised just how similar it was to his previous hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral.",9,2007
"Not usually impressed with Romantic Comedies, i found this one strangely compelling. It really was a nice movie, littered with great characters, especially Spike played by Rhys Ifans (Hilarious).",8,2005
"This film was surprisingly good, not my favourite romantic comedy in the world, and personally I think Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral are better. But it is a good film, thanks to the strong performances, fresh script and the film's look. While not laugh out loud funny, Notting Hill is nonetheless warm and charming. The script is fresh, sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. The part where Anna says ""I am just a girl, standing in front of a boy, waiting for him to love her"", may be cringe worthy to some people, but for me no matter how clichéd it is it shows a vulnerable side to Anna's character. The film is based on love revolved around unequal social standing, William being diffident and unsuccessful, Anna being the complete opposite. The photography is fabulous and the direction is excellent. Hugh Grant is charming as William and Julia Roberts is positively luminous as Anna, and the two have strong chemistry. Out of the supporting performers, Rhys Ifans stands out in a very zany turn as Spike. The music is lovely too. All in all, this is very warm, charming and pleasant, yeah the ending is predictable, but this is a well written and quite irresistible film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",8,2010
"Julia Roberts playing a famous American movie star wasn't quite a stretch and yet it felt unconvincing. The humor works the second you're seeing it but then it vanishes into thin air. It feels self conscious and forced. Once all that is said, ""Notting Hill"" emerges as a pleasant enough improbable romantic comedy in the ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" mold without ever reaching the smart, disarming charm of its model. Hugh Grant is lovely in a part destined to seem Hugh Grantish with all the clipped bit of nonsense that have made Grant a household name. The quirky friends and bizarre room mates are the questionable salt and pepper of this romantic tale. I found myself smiling, getting impatient and enjoying it, all at the same time. I'm too much of a Preston Sturgess fan to be able to sit through a modern comedy in the way I did with ""The Lady Eve"" for instance. My favorite moment: The Horse and Hound sequence. Very funny. If you've never seen a Preston Sturgess, Ernst Lubitch or Billy Wilder comedy, you may like ""Notting Hill"" much more than I did.",6,2008
"Whether or not realistic, this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful, rich, and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts, who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy, stammering, bumbling, unassuming, obscure, and not very affluent London bookseller, who shares a flat with his zany, weird roommate, Spike.",8,2006
"When i visited the Notting Hill page i was very surprised to find a modest rating for this movie (less than 7). I was not sure and would like to meet people who gave it such a poor rating and understand and inquire what else do they consider to be a great movie. This movie has everything you can ask for. Great story (i agree its a rich girl poor guy love story plot but put up beautifully), great direction, great performance, subtle but again great humor and it makes u feel so good watching it. Entertains you all along, with a perfect touch of romance, humor, sorrow and backed up with some beautiful dialogues. ",10,2011
"Those who look for a story about bittersweet romance need look no further than 'Notting Hill', starring the ever-handsome English Hugh Grant and American star, Julia Roberts. Hugh Grant's character is an ordinary man who lives and owns a travel bookstore in Notting Hill. He falls in love with celebrity actress (played by Julia Roberts) who happens to come into his store. She then leads him on a wild chase and ultimately breaks his heart while he is trying to win her over. But, like other films in this formula, there is a happy ending.",6,2006
"I had no preconceptions before watching this-- i just wanted a bit of fun diversion for the evening. Instead, what i ended up with was a nearly-unwatchable steaming pile of scenes that failed to achieve the basic requirements of story or characterisation. ",1,2007
"This is so nice movie. I thought that it is good to fall in love with a man such as Hugh Grant. He is so cool.And it is important not to give up when I fall in love with a famous and rich people like Julia Roberts in this movie. She was so beautiful and good for this roll. And Rhys Ifans was so nice. He was so funny man in this movie,but he was also good friend of Hugh Grant. He played the important roll too. I like this type of person. It was interesting to watch his funny action. Notting Hill is so wonderful place I think, and I have visited there,so I enjoyed watching this movie with seeing the view of Notting Hill. The story of this movie is so interesting and heart warming.",9,2010
"Notting Hill (1999), directed by Roger Michell, is a showpiece for Julia Roberts and for London. (Hugh Grant is pretty good too.)",8,2008
"A wonderful movie about celebrity meeting normality. Nothing Hill stars Hugh Grant, as a book store owner, whose life is changed when an international movie star, Anna, played by Julia Roberts, walks into his book store. By fate, William collides into Anna knocking his lunch all over her. William offers Anna the opportunity to clean up in his flat across the way. Anna agrees.",10,2006
"Whoever wrote the pitching line was right to say that 'Notting Hill' is 'Four Weddings and a Pretty woman', but he or she would have been more right to say that this film is a 'wanna-be Four Weddings and a Pretty Woman'. The script I thought  was appalling. It reminds me of those teenage fantasies I used to have about being a very famous actress and being admired by the man I secretly wanted to impress in real life. There's nothing wrong with these fantasies, but there's cleverer ways of exploring them. Dialogues were dreadful, the plot absurd, the acting appalling and the directing very poor. But what most worries me is the fact that people like it and that companies invest in it.  Sad indeed!!",1,1999
"This started off promising with a very good first 40 minutes, then slid downhill fast with all the typical modern-day film clichés you hear in a romance-comedy. You get the customary excused promiscuous behavior and overdone sex jokes, excessive profanity and wrong intentions with the male always at fault. (It's never the female in the ""politically correct"" world of entertainment.)",3,2008
"Was it ploppy? or floppy. I can't remember, by that time I had ordered pizza and hookers and couldn't care less what they called him, who was the most pathetic at the party or anything else these cartoon characters spewed from their poisonous hideous ploppy floppy lips. ",1,2012
"With few exceptions that the public recall, both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have been singularly blessed in their film choices. My own recollection for Roberts was some unfair carping about her nice follow-up (with Richard Gere) to PRETTY WOMEN, RUNAWAY BRIDE. Basically a different storyline, the fans of the former film were confused by the nuttiness of the latter one. For Grant there has never been a negative comment about his films that I recall, but rather that embarrassing prostitute incident a few years back that really just showed that the actor was human. Both have a nice film charisma that makes their myriads of fans very happy. In NOTTING HILL the charisma of both mixed well on screen. It is a very sweet comedy.",10,2007
"I'm sorry but I absolutely hated this sickly-sweet romantic comedy from the too-prolific pen of screenwriter Richard Curtis. It boasts, if that's the right word a wholly unbelievable plot about a mega-famous Hollywood actress (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts) escaping the trappings of stardom to naturally stumble into a London bookshop and promptly falling in love with its down-at-heel but of course down-to-earth and available mop-haired owner (played by who-else? Hugh Grant) and the ups and downs of their subsequent affair. Along for the ride are a motley crew of Grant's supposedly ""normal"" friends including Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville and kooky characters like Grant's fated-to-be-mated hippy-chick sister, played by Emma Chambers and his painfully unfunny gauche flatmate played by Rhys Ifans.",1,2014
"I've been an Andy Kaufman fan for quite a while now. True, I was around six when Andy died. But somehow this strange man was able to affect both my work and outlook. So needless to say I was looking forward to this film. And I was not disappointed.",8,1999
"""Man on The Moon"", indeed. I remember seeing Andy Kaufman's act on TV as a teenager, and I admit, I wrote him off as another comedian, with an incredibly expressive face and a flair for silliness. Years later, I'm watching him on ""Taxi"" reruns. I admired the easiness where he could go from loving Latka to malicious Vic with ease, and I thought, ""Wow, this guy really loves what he does"". And then I watch ""Man on The Moon"". Reality check.",8,2000
"Biographies of strange people have always fascinated me, and this is no exception. And ""strange"" doesn't really seem to adequately describe real-life comedian Andy Kauffman. He was REALLY different, many times very offensive, sometimes very unfunny....but always extremely interesting and certainly unique.",9,2006
"Jim Carrey delivers on of the greatest acting achievements of the nineties in this stunning biopic about the legendary comedian Andy Kaufman (the man on the moon, according to REM). For me as a European citizen, Andy Kaufman is a complete mystery. I've never seen any of his performances in Saturday Night Live nor have I ever seen any of his live shows. After seeing the movie five times, I as a Dutch not-knowing citizen who had never heard of Kaufman before, can make an image of the man and his brilliance. This is all thanks to Milos Forman and a stunning Jim Carrey, who really becomes Andy Kaufman. According to me, this movie is where Jim Carrey proves that he is just more than a funny guy, and after seeing him in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) Carrey has really proved that he is in fact a character actor.",10,2005
"I saw a special sneak preview of ""Man on the Moon"" last week in Boston. Quite simply, the film is magnificent, and truly provides the audience with a glimpse into the genius of Andy Kaufman.  There are moments of true hilarity, and moments that will break your heart.",10,1999
"Man on the Moon is one of the most heart-felt endeavors I've ever seen on film.  With each frame, you can feel how much the project means personally to all involved, especially to star Jim Carrey and producer Bob Zmuda. Although personal adoration for the subject of one's movie does not always translate into a film that audience members will identify with, Man on the Moon succeeds brilliantly.  Between Milos Forman's unique directing style, the actors' performances, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's writing, the film is able to simultaneously make you a member in one of Andy Kaufman's audiences, experiencing both joy and frustration at his antics, and a close friend who sees, or thinks they see, the Andy Kaufman behind the masks. Just as Karaszewski and Alexander did with the Ed Wood or Larry Flint biopicks, they challenge our concept of what it means to be successful by giving dignity to to the seeming misfits of our society.  However, a biopick like Man on the Moon succeeds or fails mainly on the grounds of the lead performance.  Jim Carrey proved his dramatic talent last year with a performance in The Truman Show that should have translated into an Oscar, and this year he again gives what will likely be the best performance of the year.  Carrey approaches the role of Kaufman with a level of professionalism and enthusiasm far greater than that displayed by many of today's acclaimed actors.  Carrey adopts Kaufman's mannerisms flawlessly and becomes Kaufman so convincingly that you forget Carrey is acting.  The film's other stars, in particular Paul Giamatti, Courtney Love, and Danny DeVito, all turn in excellent performances as well.",10,1999
"For all the attention he got, Andy Kaufman didn't leave much of a comic legacy. Mostly just his part on Taxi, where his Latka character could be amusing in small doses. So why make a movie about a secondary sitcom actor? Unfortunately, you'll still be asking that question when the movie is over.",1,2004
"About the only positive thing I can say is that Andy Kaufman would have loved this.  Apparently he enjoyed producing a negative effect in his audience far more than he cared about entertaining them, so this certainly is the film he would have wanted to make.  Mr. Kaufman was capable of being incredibly funny and incredibly unfunny, but he was incapable of telling the difference.",1,1999
"This was basically a summary of what Kaufman was famous for.  It didn't dig that deep into Kaufman's life - and completely glossed over some points (but that's understandable).  Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly funny, nor was it particularly introspective or touching.  The cast was good - although Courtney Love's character was never developed to any degree.  Devito was impressive as usual.",6,1999
Don't expect a funny movie just because it's a Jim Carry movie. You will be very very disappointed if you do. Even the cable guy was many times funnier then this movie. Jim Carry acted very well however it's not the kind of movie you would expect from him. Man on the moon is definitely a drama and you need to search very hard to find any comedy in it.,1,2011
"I'm a big fan of Andy Kaufman and this movie disappointed me in a big way. Jim Carey was excellent as Andy, but the movie is all surface-- simple imitation without order, purpose, or impact.  This movie only raised questions like: why were Danny DeVito and Courtney Love's characters even included?  Why did the screenwriters take credit for simply copying down Andy Kaufman's routines and passing it off as an original screenplay?  What will Milos Forman's next film be (because I'm sure it will be much better than this one)?",2,2000
I am Italian and I don't speak English very well but This film is a MASTERPIECE. Why didn't anybody tell me about it? This is surely the best film ever produced. No oscars No advertising How is it possible This film is much more beautiful than more than half of the top 250 imdb. My words are usless.,10,2001
"Knew the song, knew Jim, never heard of Andy. I don't know how alike Andy's life was to this movie, and it didn't really matter. If I knew more about Andy I may have enjoyed the movie even more than what I did. The song is better than ever, Jim was brilliant, and Andy is a funny guy.",8,2001
"I enter the film while being literally oblivious of who is Andy Kaufman, as far as I know, the film is mostly famed because it hitherto has been Jim Carrey's most Oscar-worthy performance, yet being blatantly snubbed again after his drama venture in Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998, 8/10). ",8,2015
"He was NEVER funny. I saw his crappy and uncomfortable SNL appearance and he was just a woman hating selfish asshole. He got his comeuppance when Jerry Lawler broke his neck. You see Kaufman thought it was funny to lie to people and upset them just for a joke. Professional wrestling does this but everyone knows this before they go in. Kaufman was never funny, and this movie was as dull and painful to watch as ""Cable Guy"". It was interesting to see the reactions of his ""Taxi"" co-stars to his Tony BS. Basically their incredulous and insulted faces are yours as you watch this piece of crap. This film is just an hour and a half of Jim Carey masturbating to some loser's memory. 1 out of 10",1,2008
"The early depth of character and inventive fun that this film promised in the opening scenes faded away only a third into the picture as Jim Carrey's own alter-ego tossed aside Andy Kaufman's so it looked like a Carrey biopic on Viagra, with lacklustre and bewildered support  from the ensemble actors and the badly cast Danny de Vito. As in life, compulsive practical jokers become incredibly irritating and tiresome, and the joke wore thin way before the end. A film made by Americans for Americans  most of whom seem oblivious to the shortcomings of their own over-rated and over-paid celebrities and the tackiness of most of their tv shows, which have sadly become a universal dumping ground for the rest of us.",1,2000
"Is Carrey good in this role?  Yes.  Just as he was in Truman Show.  But there is something separating him from the great actors.  He is trying to hard, he is acting too much.  Too many exaggerated expressions, and not enough of a real breathing human being.  Granted, Kaufman was aloof, but when the gaurd went down, he was closer to normal, a little shy and awkward, but normal.  It was a great task for Carrey to master the vocal tones of Kaufman, and he is much toned down from that mug fest Liar Liar, but he's still not there yet.  I think he'll get there, but not yet.",2,1999
"Jim Carry gives a hit or miss performance as Andy Kaufman.  When he hits, he really hits.  Unfortunately, there are many more misses.",4,1999
"I gave this film a rather high rating if for no other reason except that it's an excellent story about someone who was apparently totally psychotic and self absorbed. Andy Kaufmann was someone who should have been pitied and institutionalized in order to seek a cure. It's almost like the story of the Elephant Man who was put on exhibit in sideshows so people could gawk at his gross deformity. Same is the case with Kaufmann. His legacy is that of being a mildly humorous ""one joke"" comic with a very obvious dead end in show business. He's not the first though. There have been many who thought what they did was hysterically funny and clever but eventually it was proved to be nothing at all. Joe Penner in the 1930's-40's with his ""Wanna buy a duck?"" played itself out very fast and he ended in total oblivion. Or another was Parkyakarkus with his ""How DO you do!"" These people and Kaufmann have proved continually that they are of limited intellect and creativity when it comes to attempting to being funny. Lionel Barrymore was rumored to have said on his death bed, ""There's only one thing harder to do than die, and that's comedy."" As for this mish mash of a story about a mish mash of a ""comdeian"", it's only entertaining to the morbid curious and clinical minded. Otherwise it's a definite ""pass"".",7,2006
"I went to see this movie knowing very little of Andy Kaufman, and I came out knowing little more.  While structured in a semi-interesting way, the movie worked too hard to be entertaining and not hard enough at making Andy a believable person--it was impossible to get to know or like Andy. Whatever you thought going in was the only thing you could think when you left. Jim Carrey's performance seemed barely adequate for the task, and he was not able to cover up for his lack of acting ability here any more than in his previous big screen ""triumph,"" The Truman Show.  While the sequences involving the cast of Taxi reprising their roles from the show (with Danny DeVito, the producer and another actor in this movie, conspicuously absent), very little of the rest of the movie displayed the same life or energy. In the future, I hope filmmakers who would like to create biopics of complex (or perhaps misunderstood?) figures will take a lesson from the failures of Man on the Moon and make sure the movie reveals something about its subject that goes beyond common knowledge.",5,2000
"The first time I saw Andy Kaufman was on the Saturday Night Live 15th anniversary show.  In the clips from the first 5 years, they showed a few seconds of his Mighty Mouse thing, and I found it strange and funny.  Since then, I've seen him on old Saturday Night Live shows, and comedian specials, and seen a few old Taxi episodes(though I was never a big fan), and found him to be quite strange, but also quite funny.  So I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was not disappointed.",10,1999
"""East is East""- another boring film we have to watch in our English lesson. These were my first thoughts when I heard that this film will be the next topic our English class has to deal with. But that is absolutely not the case! This film is a great enrichment for the viewer and it is no boring stuff at all.",9,2008
"Three teenagers are sitting in front of a TV, enjoying their large helpings of pork sausage and bacon. Suddenly they hear a door opening and immediately start cleaning up all of the dishes and unsuccessfully try to get rid of the fumes of grilled bacon and sausages that billowed through the whole house. This is, of course, not depicting the normal life of three teenagers, but taken from the film ""East Is East"" by Damien O'Donnell. It deals with the story of a family in England in the 1970s with a Pakistani father (multi-facetted enacted by Om Puri) who still believes in his Pakistani traditions and his Muslim religion and an English mother (great performance by Linda Bassett) who tries to give her seven children as much freedom as all of their ""fully English"" friends enjoy. This movie was labeled as a Comedy both in theaters and on DVD or VHS, but anybody looking for light-hearted entertainment fitting for a Saturday night will be hugely disappointed. This movie is out to teach the viewer about how difficult it is to get two very different cultures to not only co-exist peacefully next to each other, but to merge them to create a new one. The script by Ayub Khan-Din, who also wrote the book and the stage version of this movie, does have its funny moments, and the whole cast, including the children, is in for some good laughs. But the more intense moments are those where the viewer has to deal with outbursts of domestic violence or things like arranged marriages that seem so far away and cruel to Westerners. The cast shows its brilliance in those intimate moments. Even though the script might sometimes appear to be too ambitious  there are just too many characters all developing in a very distinct manner and all crucial to the movie  the movie can be recommended to anyone who is not looking for a standard comedy and is willing to have his views on life challenged.",8,2006
"East is East"" is a refreshing inventive family story. Directly the first scene where two different religions and also two opposing views of life (namely the children's and the view of their conservative father) clash together. With the funny way of telling which is typical for the whole film, nevertheless the problems are shown in their graveness. The cast represents every member of this Pakistani family as an individual but the good relations between the siblings and their mother is shown as realistic as the problematic relation between them and their incorrigible father. The viewer gets the impression of a different culture but he will recognize a lot of aspects of his own family life, too, what was aimed by the makers who brought in the personal experiences. All in all, this movie is an evening-filling enrichment for the viewer.",9,2008
"Excellent film of interracial family, traditions versus the contemporary and chartering somewhere in the middle ground. I was somewhat dubious about the way EAST IS EAST was touted as a comedy, seemingly about horny teenagers and adolescent rebellion against parental authority. I thought, Oh Lord, the Americans have a lock on this type of flick, and now the British want in, too.   Then, I saw Om Puri's name as the lead. I have been a longtime fan of this amazing actor, and thought, well it's worth a look.",10,2001
"A bitter-sweet comedy with some moments of truly stark drama, this is a high-class movie.  Yes, there are randy dogs and fat, ugly girls - but the piece is a class act because it mixes those ""laugh-out-loud funny"" comic set pieces with great drama so cleverly.  ",7,2002
Call me biased but British comedy is unbeatable for it's freshness and depth of character. In the ranks of British comedy east is east is in the top rank. While making serious comment on the community and personal problems of race mix in working class england around 1970 (has anything changed?) this film extracts so much humour. I am just in awe of the talent on both sides of the camera. Don't miss this masterpiece,10,2000
"I didn't want to do this, but after reading how many poor souls think that this movie is an accurate represenation of a Pakistani immigrant, you should know that it isn't!",4,2001
"""East is East"" tried to cover too many issues and genres in the one film. In the end I don't think the script was strong enough to tie all this together, and the film suffered because of it. Having said that I believe it was a strong performance from a talented cast.",7,2001
"No doubt to a large extent due to my low tolerance for vulgarity, violence, and adolescent humor, I came away almost wishing I hadn't seen this film. Perhaps blinders prevented me from really seeing ""East is East"", which I saw tonight at a local Indian film festival, for what it is.",4,2000
"Damien O'Donnel's bright and colourful comedy drama is, for the most part, an entertaining and nostalgic tale of the conflicts within a mixed-race family in early seventies Manchester. A hit in the UK upon release the film also did modest business in the US helped by a marketing campaign that promoted it as a breezy comedy but the film also tackles the serious question of what it was, and what it is, to be young, Asian and British. It's curious, and perhaps a little disappointing, that despite the early seventies setting the film steadfastly refuses to tackle the broader issue of racism in any depth. At a time when Enoch Powell was extolling the virtues of repatriation and the nations favourite sitcom was 'From Death Us Do Part' (or possibly 'Love Thy Neighbour') the worst any character in East Is East has to contend with is a shifty look from a nightclub bouncer. Powell does have a brief cameo, as a poster on a window that the family's daughter Meenah (Archie Panjabi) smashes in a defiant demonstration of her footy skills. It's a nice moment, a teenage Asian girl kicking in Enoch's head with a soccer ball  What would Alf Garnett say? Unfortunately we don't get to find out as the films only really abusive white character (Who bears a suspicious resemblance to Johnny Spate's 'lovable racist') only appears a couple of times to mutter something about 'Bloody Pakis' or 'Pickininies'. The conflict between Indians and Pakistanis is given a similar treatment, with George expressing his distaste for ""Those cow worshipping bastards"" and the contemporary conflict on the subcontinent being relayed on the family's radio. Again, however, this seems more to add colour and humour than for any other purpose. Perhaps O'Donnell felt that a deeper examination of these issues would detract from the theme of Asian/British identity and it's true that other British features have dealt with the subjects in greater detail. Having said that it might have been an idea to make a passing reference to the fact that racial prejudice, while not necessarily any more commonplace than today, was certainly seen as more acceptable. Of course, despite the considerable attention to period detail, 'East Is East' lays no claim to painstaking factual accuracy. There's a fairytale like quality to the film heightened by the Bollywood-style primary colours that frequently contrast with the drab Salford landscape. This viewer was reminded of Hettie MacDonald's council estate love story 'Beautiful Thing', like this based on a stage play with a script by the original author. Both of these films employ a subtle heightened sense of reality that suggests a half remembered childhood memory. One marvellous sequence set in a Bradford Asian flea pit (The 'Moti Mahal') sees the entire Khan clan sitting transfixed during the latest Bollywood epic. It's that rare occasion when the conflicts within the family can be forgotten in favour of a fleeting moment of escapism. And conflicts there are, because the real meat of the film concerns the alienation that exists between the rigidly traditionalist George and the other family members. Played, with a mix of bumbling comedy and genuine menace, by Omi Puri George is certain he knows what's best for his children, not to mention his wife. He wants the kids to learn Urdu but they refuse to study, his precious sons should marry into another Pakistani family of his choosing but they want to screw around with white girls and his wife refuses to show the respect that is demanded in a Muslim marriage. George, while not exactly an anachronism  he gets plenty of understanding from the like minded down at the local Mosque  is a man who cannot see that his children are not like him. Their only sense of the 'homeland' is through their father and the traditions he imposes upon them. It's not surprising then that they consider themselves unequivocally British. Upon arrival in Bradford one of the youngsters takes a look at the locals and shouts excitedly ""There's 'undreds of 'em!"" In a way it's a shame that the family is mixed race. Not enough is done with this to really justify it and how much more impact the conflict between George and Ella (Linda Bassett) would have been were she also Asian. The fact that the Khan children are half Caucasian also simplifies the question of British-Asian identity a little too needlessly. All of this might suggest a rather dry, even depressing film, but like the colourful feature playing at the Moti Mahal 'East Is East' never forgets it's primary function is to entertain. This is, after all, essentially a comedy and it's frequently very funny indeed. The humour ranges from extremely broad  a scene involving the 'banished' sons new life as manager of a 'swinging' London Boutique and another involving a latex vagina could both have come from an 'Austin Powers' movie  to the grimly dark. The best example of this might be youngest son Sajid's (Who lives permanently inside his Parka like a prototype for 'South Park's Kenny) trip to hospital for a circumcision. Towards the end of the film, in a moment mirroring this, he has the hood of his jacket unceremoniously ripped off and is finally exposed to the outside world, or as close to the outside world as George allows the family to get. Clearly Khan-Din's surrogate in the film (Himself a Salford boy who would have been ten in 1971) much of 'East Is East' is viewed through his eyes and from this perspective the film can be seen as something of a 'coming of age' tale. While not entirely successful 'East Is East' is still a welcome addition to the increasing ranks of British-based Asian cinema and television. Seemingly made with a broad audience in mind it, nevertheless, takes up some serious issues. It's just a shame the filmmakers weren't willing to stick their necks out just a little bit further.",6,2005
"I just saw this incredible ensemble movie - I was most struck by the amazing ensemble acting by the entire cast, mostly unknown to me (Archie Panjabi is an emmy winner for her role on ""The Good Wife"", and I have seen Linda Bassett in a few movies). I absolutely hated the father - he reminded me of my late father, who was also a bully who was enraged by his lack of ability to control others completely - Om Puri gives a ferocious performance - I would be curious to know what the actor felt about his part, did he see him (as I do) as a villain or did he see him as ""right""? I found Linda Bassett's role a bit infuriating: those women who stay with their abusive disgusting husbands no matter what. I loved how rebellious the kids were, yet they stayed stuck under this tyrant's thumb. But they could escape into British culture, the neighborhood, school, music, culture that was not Pakistani. The gay son was certainly stereotypical but I still found it daring - it's rare to see a happy gay couple (who also appear to be ""married"") in movies from before 2000. Meena's dance is wonderful and fun. Damien O'Donnell's direction makes me wish he could make more movies (I've also loved ""Rory O'Shea Was Here"", which was originally titled ""Inside I'm Dancing"", but his other few films don't seem to have made it over here) - his direction is incredibly self-assured and brilliant, it was his feature film debut (he had made short films and commercials previously). I especially loved the feel of the film, the production design, the street - interestingly, it was filmed at Ealing Studios, 40 years after the last of the Ealing films were produced there. While this film can get my blood boiling - I wished somebody would run the father over with a car or do anything to get him to STOP his bullying disgusting behavior. (Why is he married to her? It's a real mystery. If he's so ""Pakistani"", why isn't he married to a Pakistani woman?) But that's what's so great about this movie: it can be simultaneously infuriating AND fascinating! I absolutely loved this movie!!!",10,2012
"As a 27 year old Muslim who grew up in this country I have to say I could not relate to much of this film. My gripe lies with the inaccuracies of a director who couldn't get the details of the film correct. He managed to get the 70s look and feel of the film spot on, he even managed to get the Indian films and songs of the time right as well. However, being a Muslim director he couldn't (or more precisely deliberately didn't) get the religious details right. These include (spoilers here, but reading them won't spoil the storyline): Muneer getting up in the morning when the sun was well high and starting to pray (prayer at this time is prohibited in Islam!), or all the boys of every age being taught one monotonous sentence by an Imam at the mosque when in reality children of different ages are taught at different levels of difficulty. Minor things one might say, but details are everything with me.",6,2000
"This film depicts ultimate realism for people who have grown up in multi racial environments. The graphic nature of the language only goes to reinforce the raw acceptance of the cultural influence of the times and area in which the film is set (70's Manchester, England). The director has captured the emotional elements the script intended perfectly. It was obviously deeply researched. The character portrayal of the dominant father is by no means stereotypical of the part, but is truly based on the difficulties encountered by the respected head of any multicultural family. His six sons and one daughter are experiencing the natural mix of eastern and western influence and putting their own spin on their existence, much to their father's dismay. The character of the mother portrays the natural ethnic blindness that should be much admired and is yet so common throughout the world. The humor is very real. Every family, if they look back on their own historical events would come to recognise the similarity of the situations encountered. The work surely ranks among the very best in regional exposure along side the likes of ""Kes"" etc. Well worth watching more than once",10,2000
"East is East is an brilliant effort to convey a Father's dilemma's & tribulations in a multiracial family/community.From an asian perspective this movie could'nt be much farther than the truth of what's really happening. Om puri,the seasoned actor that he is,carries the film on his shoulder with excellent support from Basset and others.One scene in particular,When he sees the photographs of his would-be daughters-in-law,he contemplates between the word he has given and family honour, and decides hastily lest he should lose his face.Throughout the movie he shines in many scenes, which only a great actor can do justice. Basset in the confrontation with mother of the brides, performs brilliantly in suppressing/bursting with anger.The children, all of them have made the movie what it is,with each one of them excelling in one way or other.Neighbours and friends support the films appeal/message very well.",10,2002
"Though the subject matter is interesting and relevant, I didn't like the absurdly unrealistic character portrayal of the father. I am familiar with the demographic that this movie was trying to depict, and this paints a throughly unredeeming picture of a dysfunctional family. Nothing goes right in this family, from the sibling relationships, to intrafamily communication, to religious education, to anger management... Not to say that some of these issues don't exist in some Pakistani families living in Britain, but the fact that this is a rare glimpse into this population, the viewer can be easily misled into thinking that these backwards-ass families are the norm.

"It's not that the film isn't funny - although it isn't (intentionally); it's not that it isn't dramatic (it's certainly melodramatic). It is simply that when it's not being absurd it's being offensive, when it's not being offensive, it's being risible; all the time, it's being simply INCOMPETENT to the point of dementia. The acting is abysmal, especially Om Puri who acts like he's in a Victorian melodrama, and Linda Bassett, who acts like she's in a poor episode of On the Buses.",1,2007
"In November of 1999, a very strange thing happened.  An intelligent action film filled with well-drawn characters, an unconventional plot structure, and a storyline that required you to pay attention.  Stranger still, it was a James Bond film, a series widely regarded by the mass public as `fluff' when Bond films have actually been among the prime example of properly done plot-motivated action pieces.  The highly underrated `The Living Daylights' comes to mind.",8,2002

There are a lot of neat references to previous Bond-movies (Universal Exports ring a bell?) and I have to give them one star for that. I also give the movie one star for excellent casting, and the last star goes to the actors who did a pretty good job. But this movies' real problem lies in the fact that it has no story. It's the weakest script ever in a Bond movie, and they have tried to put too much into it. Instead of making a movie, they've tried to create one long action-sequence. Guess what: IT DOESN'T WORK!!!

"Has there ever been a more beautiful baddie in a Bond film than Sophie Marceau? (maybe Luciana Paluzzi in 'Thunderball' to answer my own question) This woman is GORGEOUS and one of the series best characters. Pierce Brosnan gets better with each movie and out of his four this is probably the best. The pre-credit sequence, the longest in the films history is worth the entrance fee alone, an amazing chase along the river Thames it is simply stunning and should really only be viewed on a big screen. This sequence is what Bond is all about, outrageously over the top excitement that kicks the film off to a cracking start, in fact I'd go as far as saying this is the best pre-credit beginning of all the Bond films. The story actually makes sense as well for once - no real plot twists (except Electra) and all the action is there for a reason, not just as spectacle. Judi Dench gets her best outing in this, proving herself capable of getting out of tight situations and it's nice to see Robbie Coltrane again (the caviar factory scene being another highlight). The humour is kept in check and doesn't descend into parody like some in the series ('Diamonds Are Forever' for example) but when Bond says 'Q isn't going to like this' when his car gets sliced in half is one of the funniest moments in any of the films. Speaking of Q this is Desmond LLewelyns last Bond movie, he died shortly after and the film is dedicated to him. All in all this is as good as any of Connerys films and the best since 'The Spy Who Loved Me' with good all round performances from all involved although Denise Richards was obviously picked more for her looks than acting ability. A worthy addition to the series this is my 6th favourite 007 film.",10,2006
"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH has to be my favorite James Bond film. It seems that Pierce Brosnan's Bond films have the longest teasers (pre-credits sequences) in the series and the River Thames chase was a brilliant start, not to mention well-filmed with the London background. The action scene that stands out from them all in the film is the helicopter attack on the Caspian Sea. The plot is very interesting with twists and turns with all the oil involvement, and Pierce perhaps gives his finest Bond performance in his four outings.",10,2011
I am a great Bond-fan so I was very intruiged to see the new Bond-film 'The World is not Enough.',10,2000
"Well it's Bond! He's back again for a 19th instalment of the same usual set of gags, gadgets, girls and guns! Can the world not get enough of this already?",8,1999
"TWINE is without doubt the 007 adventure of the 90's. I would consider it to be one of the best Bond movies ever, but for sure the best of the Brosnan era so far, because it perfectly combines Bond's universe with the real world. The movie has a terrific look, crystal clear colours and benefits from the great craft of Clark and Biddle who both did a fantastic job. In addition Pierce Brosnan gives one of the best performances in years, taking his character both seriously and on the other hand not too seriously. Sophie Marceau offers a fantastic villainess and puts herself in one line with Chris Walken, Robert Davi and Klaus Maria Brandauer.",10,1999
"I am disappointed about what a number of critics have said about this Bond film. The acting was great, especially Sophie Marceau. The plot was good and not out of the realms of possibility. The gadgets were realistic as well and the action was non-stop and fun. The direction by Michael Apted was also good and what I except from a Bond film My only criticisms was the casting of Denise Richards because she can't act and I would have casted someone older and John Cleese as R because his type of comedy does not fit with Bond, but luckily he was only in the film for a minute and the send off for Desmond Llewelyn was worthy to his years of service. A worthy Bond film to watch and as long as you don't watch Die Another Day, Pierce Bronson would be join best Bond with Sean Connery.",9,2007
"Excellent plot (although the villain's medical 'condition' that allows him to perform at superhuman powers because he does not feel pain is a little implausible), fantastic locations and setting, fast-paced action and enough sexual tension and banter mean that this film has all the hallmarks of a classic bond. And not as over-commercialised as Die Another Day.",10,2005
"Why? Because the three Bond movies made in between THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH have had nothing in the way of original elements. This Bond movie plays with structure and format. The pre-credits sequence is packed with plot and action, satisfying in both departments. Bond is less gadget dependent here, making him more like a real spy (or the pre-GOLDFINGER Bond). There is a dark edge on Bond's character, and the set-up is utterly sweet.",10,2003
THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (1999) ***1/2,8,2000
"After a great start with Goldeneye and the hugely enjoyable Tomorrow Never Dies, Brosnan's run as Bond hits the jackpot with this fantastic action film that is undeniably one of the best James Bond films ever made. It has everything. It has some of the finest action sequences the series has ever thrown up (the pre-credit sequence is to die for), two classic villains in the shape of Reynard and Elektra (they even have Bond baddie names) and what is a surprisingly good little story. Sure it's not Tolstoy or Shakespere, but the plot is very effective and offers up many twists and turns, but as well as that the script is very daring for a 007 movie. First of all the pre-title sequence ends in disaster. The man Bond is trying to save winds up blown to pieces and to further add insult to injury, the usually indestructible secret agent winds up seriously injured ending up with his arm in a cast after the fantastically stylish credit sequence. Even better is that the injury becomes his weakness for the rest of the film and the writers even have him fall in love, a relationship that leads to a denouement more akin to the Dalton era.",10,2003

"This is definitely Pierce Brosnan`s best Bond film (if not overall film) to date. He has really settled into the role now and has made the character his own. There is an intriguing storyline and one of the castlists to appear in the entire series. John Cleese makes a very promising start (to what he has now announced is a 3-picture deal) as Q`s assistant ""R"". The music (by David Arnold)is one of the best soundtracks- rating with some of John Barry`s best. Roll on Bond 20 !!",10,1999
"The 19th installment in the James Bond film franchise ""The World Is Not Enough"" looks poised and muscular enough to renew the famous British secret service agent's license to kill for the next century. In the right hands, this predictable but dependable formula of sex, violence, witty dialogue, elaborate plotting, and epic villainy rarely misses. Comparatively, ""The World Is Not Enough"" shares the spirit of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""Octopussy."" All Bond movies are alike, of course, but this escapade differs in its gallery of villains, its serpentine plotting, and its elegant but aggressive verve. The imaginative screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein features dramatic bedrock. Although the filmmakers have dispersed the usual spectacular special effects and high octane action stunts throughout ""TWINE,"" strong, solid characters and an interesting plot are what hold this actioneer together. Unlike the sinewy ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" ""Twine"" unfolds with a seamless grace instead of as a string of impressive episodes lashed together by an acrobatic plot. Happily, story takes precedence here. If you're not careful, the surprises may actually catch you by surprise.",10,2008
"From the time he took over the role of James Bond, I've tended to dismiss the Pierce Brosnan era as one of the weaker periods of the franchise. That assessment was cemented with Brosnan's last outing as Bond in Die Another Day  quite possibly the very worst of the 21 official Bond movies. But something odd keeps happening. I keep going back to The World is Not Enough. I've actually probably seen it more times in the past 5 years than any other Bond film. I realize now that it's not only Brosnan's best effort in the series, but also it's one of my five or six favorite Bond movies.",8,2008
"Following what was in my mind one of the worst bond movies ever, ""the world is not enough"" manages to repent for its prequels sin's.The plot is solid with plenty of bond type action(which is him doing super human things against multiple enemies who can never manage to hit him.)But isn't this why we go to see bond movies?? Its unrealistic....but who cares?? thats the point.. The boat scene is also very good(all be it long). But what puzzles me is the general hatred of Denise Richards and her character Dr.Christmas Jones... Now I know its crazy that a beautiful American physicist could ever end up working for the Russians in Kazakhstan...but bond needs a good bond girl and she is one...I mean you can't have him sleeping with some fat ugly Russian woman... All in all this film is a action packed movie which unlike its older brother lives up to the bond name.",10,2006
This is another satisfying Bond adventure that delivers what many people expect from a Bond film and even a few new things as well.,8,2016
The World is Not Enough By Dean Kish,8,1999
"Austin Powers is one of those movies that has become MORE popular as time wears on. Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets, fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.",7,2000
"The follow-up to 1997's Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery was probably not a certainty form the get-go:if I recall correctly,the first Austin Powers was NOT the smashing success of a box-office film that many involved initially imagined,and had it not been for a strong reaction from video and DVD renters,the franchise may've stopped at one. Since I happened to enjoy the first one(saw it on video BTW),I can honestly say that while the sequels seemed to have depreciating value,I'm still glad that Myers and company went ahead with the follow-ups.",8,2007
I believe that the general consensus is that the first Austin Powers movie is the best of the bunch. I happen to disagree (as you can probably tell from my one-line-summary). I feel that the second film actually improves on the first film by adding a few new characters and generally cutting loose on the humor making it even more bizarre and funny than in the first film. I don't expect people to agree but at least hear me out as to why I think the second film is better.,7,2005
"I know it sounds silly, but I just think this is one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. Maybe I was just in a good mood or something, but I was a little surprised by the rating of just 6.5 because I knew a lot of people who enjoyed the movie as well as I did.",9,2002
"The Spy who Shagged Me - not a title you'd expect to garner much respect, but this movie does okay. With Austin Powers 2 we see the arrival of such characters as Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, who inevitably help steer the sequel way from completely recycling every joke used in the first film. However, there is still that overlap, so a lot of the humor comes off a bit stale and tacky. There is virtually no end to the plot holes, inconsistencies, and various irregularities, but that is often a big part of the humor of the Austin Powers movies - making direct fun of the spy genre, as well as themselves.",8,2004

"The first Austin Powers movie was a shot-in-the-dark comedy Michael Myers pretty much made for himself and a few friends, little imagining the fuss it would spawn. This time, Myers and his alter egos set out to build a middle-brow entertainment franchise. At least they got the money part right.",6,2007
"I get a perverse kick out of the other deliberately-stupid humor of these ""Austin Powers"" movies. They are extremely bright and colorful - photography- wise, but full of dark comedy moments as well as light-hearted slapstick. Best of all, they poke fun at the ludicrous 1960s lifestyle, particularly in England. Many people may think they glorifying the hedonism of the period, and maybe that's the case, but find it more of a satire and see it that way.",8,2006
"If I had merely 1/600th of the monstrous advertising budget of this film, I think even I could have made a better movie.",5,2000
The concept was ok but hardly original. The acting was plastic. But the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a grubby one at that. This is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time. Don't dare to watch it with your kids.,1,2000

"""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was mostly really funny - with Austin continuing his face-off with Dr. Evil - but the stool sample scene was unnecessary. Still, the rest of the movie was a hoot, especially all the slang names for the spaceship. Some of the things in these movies, I wonder how they're able to come up with, especially some of Mini-Me's gags. All in all, it's a movie that you're sure to love, particularly with the Jerry Springer scene and all the associations with world events.",7,2006
AUSTIN POWERS: The Sequel that Gagged Me,1,1999
"This is one great movie. To me, to make a good comedy movie you need to make it very funny, and have a cast of lovable zany characters. If you have all that then you got a great comedic movie on your hands.",10,1999
"I thought the first Austin Powers was one of the funniest movies i have seen in ages.  An intelligent satire of the whole James Bond motif, with several take-offs that were direct pot shots at the bond movies.",1,2001
"Did you like the first Austin Powers movie with it's rip off belaboured jokes and simplistic humour?  Did you?  Do you want a complete rehash of the first movie lacking any originality and recycling the same tired old jokes for a second go-round?  If so, then this is the movie for you!  Although your time might be better spent studying for your GED or something, many Genetic Defectives and complete idiots who don't recognise a beaten dead horse when they see it have flocked to this horrible movie, and have laughed because they felt they were supposed to.  Be a part of the many faceless Austin Powers imitators out there, and say goodbye to the opposite sex.  You are pitied!",1,2001
"First of, I did enjoy the first AP film, so it's not like this didn't have the potential to entertain me. When this film was in the theaters, I was warned by a friend as to how bad it was and for that reason I waited until the video release to see the film. I'm soooo glad I did.",1,2000
"A movie not worth seeing.  Truly a waste of scarce resources.  A sad commentary on the current state of the cinéma, and, perhaps more so, on its patrons.",1,1999
"This is even more stupid, filthy and disgusting than the first Austin Powers movie. Michael York would be better off working the midnight shift at the 7-11, selling pencils on the corner or holding a ""Will work for food"" sign, it's more dignified than trying to inject any talent or class into this cesspool of a movie. Mike Myers, please use your considerable talent in something other than this crap. You've been great in ""Wayne's World"" and ""Shrek"". Mike will do anything for a laugh, whether he gets one or not, and here he gets none. The brainless, obvious, dirty and disgusting puns are matched only by the scene in which Powers drinks liquid sewage. That pretty much describes the whole sorry mess. How did this excrement make money? It gets one star, but should really get zero.",1,2006
"If you think this is funny then you will relish the idea of being told that you have been diagnosed with decomposing legs.   This jerk Myers is possibly (How about Martin Short) the lousiest ""comedian"" I have ever seen.   Last night I watched one of those classy British comedies To The Manor Born.  Tonight I attempted to view this garbage. I could`nt believe that there are people who think this is funny, I`ll bet their craniums are full of air.   ABSOLUTE TRASH.   Maybe his stint on Saturday Night Live contributed to his excursion into the realms of idiocy.",1,2002

"Unfortunately, very disappointing film. Same jokes, the same humour or lack of it that proves that sequels are ALWAYS worse than originals. How Mike could not have noticed that the plot is going nowhere and additions of Fat and Mini are shallow? Please do not see it if you loved the original Austin Powers.",1,1999
"The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a ""story behind the story"" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere.",10,2006
"Any reservations that I had about the film being be a turkey, were almost immediately quelled upon seeing the movie. From the offset Mr. Depp throws himself into the role of Icabod Crane with enthusiasm and gusto; portraying excellently a man of ""science"" suddenly out of his depth in legend. Christina Ricci also plays the role of Katrina van Tassel superbly; a sure sign of good things to come from this talented young actress.",10,2000
"Tim Burton has done it again. It seems he can't really go wrong; especially when he's paired with Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. The production is gorgeous in every way; the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, the set design is incredible and the way Burton uses the color red to accentuate the lack of color and dreariness otherwise experienced in Sleepy Hollow is a visual treat. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to watch. The performances are flawless, I have to commend Burton for using such a great array of underappreciated character actors, such as Jeffrey Jones and Michael Gough.. and even poor little Casper Van Dien; the man just can't seem to get any respect (and he doesn't here either). Ricci is wonderful in a role totally against type, and Depp is refreshing as ever. Christopher Walken is just the coolest guy ever, and as the Headless Horseman he's even scarier than normal. The best thing, though, is Danny Elfman's music. Why on earth doesn't the man have an Oscar yet? What is going on?? He should at least get a nomination for this one.",9,1999
"I thoroughly enjoyed this collaboration between Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Washington Irving.  Combining such incredible talents as Mr. Burton and Mr. Walker proved quite the appropriate recipe for recreating the Irving classic.  I have read may other comments about this movie and I find it very disturbing that most people either compare it to Star Wars: Phantom Menace or complain that it is too far removed from the original story.",8,1999
"Tim Burton has again proved his worth with a masterpiece of gothic horror. The whole way the film is made is excellent, from the way the special effects are used to enhance the story, rather than sell the movie, to the superb acting of the entire cast. I must confess I was a little reluctant at first to see Johnny Depp in the lead role, but from the outset my mind was changed as he threw himself enthusiastically into the part with exactly the right mix of assumed self confidence tempered by a realistic portrayal of a man hopelessly out of his depth in the situation in which he finds himself.",10,2000
SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) ***1/2,8,1999
"I just saw Sleepy Hollow in an advanced Preview show in the UK.  I went with a couple of mates, all of whom had seen some Tim Burton before but only I was a big fan.  I simply love Tim Burton's surreal style of directing and of all the films I've seen of his (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, etc.) I thought only Mars Attacks! Was less than superb.  ESH for example has a superbly innocent atmosphere to it but it extremely dark at times.  So now, with the release of a new Tim Burton film (of a story I remember fondly from the old Disney Cartoon of the 50's) I was rather excited to see it!  And so, I sat in the darkened cinema at my local Multiplex and was amazed.  From the dark and mysterious opening to the more humour-spiked yet no less horrific end this is one of my favourite films ever!  I'm a big horror film fan and was so looking forward to seeing what take Tim Burton would have a true horror film.  My god, he did well.  The look of the piece is both extremely dark and evil (the Horseman kills men, women and children with equal relish) but it retains scenes of beautiful, dreamlike states once again making good use of Mr. Burton's own thoughts and visions.  It's a very funny film too.  Depp is great as an Englishman (only slipping into American twang in one syllable early on in the movie) who will battle the horseman and inspect headless, beetle filled corpses with gusto but then leap onto a chair, screaming when he sees a spider!  Christina Ricci was also very good.  Usually, her parts are beautiful yet rather evil characters that look innocent and pure until you look into her eyesnot this time though.  She just looks, well, sweet! She's softly spoken, and very caring and that's it, no daggers in the pupils, no sly frowns to the camera.  Christopher Walken made the small role he had in the headless horseman (he played him on the few occasions he actually had a head) his own with his usual evil visage and a load of screaming!  Plus nastily shaved down teeth.  The real masterstroke of this film though, or at least its main bad guy is the use of Ray Park.  For those of you who saw Episode One and enjoyed the lightsabre battle at the end, Ray Park was Darth Maul!  He brings a very modern look to the fighting, most scenes are fought with a sword in one hand and an axe in the other! Its like a medieval John Woo!  But almost every time that he gets hold of a weapon he does some kind of stylish one-handed flip to the sound of wonderfully over-the-top swish sounds!  The deaths, most of which decapitations of course, are all seen onscreen in their full, gory glory.  Not a single piece of blood escapes the cameras here!  The film really does have a lot of blood in it but it's a kind of comic book redder than red blood, which adds to the whole films not quite real feel.  The cinematography is once again, from Burton, superb.  The vile smog0filled 18th century New York and the Scarecrow at the beginning.  My god, the scarecrow, its so evil!  Onscreen for a second but its image lasts But anyway, in short, this is a fantastic film.  Burton has never done anything this visually eye-popping before (take a bow Industrial Light & Magic).  The plot is both intriguing and whimsical, the acting excellent, it has a cameo from Hammer Horror master Christopher Lee and it boasts one of the most evil, most frightening, most superbly realized supernatural baddies I've ever seenand I've seen plenty! Go see this film if you like horror or you just want some fast-paced fun 9 out of 10",8,2000
"Having seen Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, as well as knowing about other Tim Burton films (Nightmare Before Christmas, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks, etc.), you'd think going into a film such as this that not much could really put you off. Wrong. Despite how I rate it, this film is entirely watchable...maybe even two or three times compared to some other films out there. But, to me, it falls short on several fronts.",5,2006
This makes a good commercial film.,7,2005
"""Sleepy Hollow"" has to be one of the best horror movies that I've seen for a long time. The story has been brought to life by excellent camera work and mind blowing cinematography. Tim Burton does another brilliant work directing this movie, securing his spot as one of the best directors in present day Hollywood. Also the veteran Francis Ford Coppola comes back from 'retirement' by being the executive producer for this big budgeted movie. The visual effects are stunning, and the dolby surround sound makes the regular cinema goer feel like he is back to the mysterious village of Sleepy Hollow. The background music is also very soothing, and it sets the tone for the movie.",10,2005
"One day, a board of movie studio executives were gathered around a big, big table. One of them burst out: ""Guess what! I just signed a deal to make the Sleepy Hollow story into a movie!""",6,2006
"First of all, the so-so parts: While Christina Ricci's cool portrayal of Katrina gives the character an appropriately otherworldly aura, she really could have used more fire at emotional moments.  Some scenes are unduly rushed, including a few with crucial exposition, making the plot hard to follow at some points.  Finally, Danny Elfman's music is too intrusive at times, distancing viewers when they should be drawn in.",6,2000
"surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.",1,2000
"The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so I'll preface with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie ""based"" on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, ""witchcraft"" meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship ""an'-it-harm-none"" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's ""The Golden Bough"", if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant her to be a blonde.",4,2004
"This film is excellent. it is truly awesome. It has a star studded cast including Johnny Depp!. Not for the faint hearted though as this film mixes Gothic, gory and plain heads rolling around with romance, hilarity in a way and filled with the hottest of hot Johnny Depp who plays Ichabod Crane an intelligent yet perhaps slightly wimpy detective. He faints 7 times for crap's sake! I do feel the movie lacks faults as it is always good to laugh at stupid mistakes people make! This film is really worth seeing and will make you scared of axes forever. it send that cold yet exciting chill down your spine and will make you want to see it again and again. And even again and again.",10,2005
"Sleepy Hollow is definitely ranked among my five favourite films (and considering I could be ranked among the ten greatest cinema fans, that is saying something). Johnny Depp gives, as always, a brilliant performance in his spectacularly unique style of acting. The only minute flaw I find is that the plot is quite difficult to follow, and you probably won't get it the first time you watch the film (if you do, have you considered joining Mensa?). This film could more than likely rank as a classic Horror movie.",10,2004
"Tim Burton, as always you know my rant on the love I have for this director, when given a dark subject, he always does a great job with it. Everyone knows the story of the famous headless horseman of Sleepy Hollow, every Halloween, we are guaranteed to at least see the cartoon or hear the story. So one of the best known ghost stories of all time stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, the famous scientist who is a non-believer until he finally faces the scary figure. Johnny was definitely a great choice as Ichabod, he brought the perfect amount of strangeness, intelligence and then you have to love that he adds Ichabod being a bit of a coward, which to be honest was very human. Then Tim just had to add the nightmarish feature of having Christopher Walken as the ghost of the headless horseman, that wasn't a pretty image.",10,2002
Director Tim Burton's elaborate take on Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman doesn't have much in common with Irving but excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor.,8,2017
"This is the fourth collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton I have seen (the previous three being Sweeney Todd, the Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands) and I can say without an instance's doubt that it is easily the worst of the four. In fact, if it were not for Johnny Depp, then I would have stopped watching half an hour in to this poor excuse for a film.",2,2008
"If you enjoy Tim Burton movies, you will certainly enjoy this one. Although not particularly true to the original story, or even the Disney version, the movie does contain all the elements that make Sleepy Hollow a classic scare story.  Also throughout the movie are little touches that just scream Tim Burton.  Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beetlejuice all receive a nod in this movie (whether intentional or not I don't know).",6,1999
"Sleepy Hollow (If I have already done a review on this movie, too bad, I will just do another one!)",10,2000
"Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of Ichabod Crane  played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas.",1,1999
"As a huge fan of Rene Clement's ""Purple Noon"" I came to Minghella's version of Patricia Highsmith's story with suspicion and an irrational predisposition to dismiss it. Well, I was wrong. The talented Mr. Minghella perpetrated a magic trick. The film stands on its own as an entertaining, creepy, thoughtful, beautiful to look at piece of film-making. Jude Law throw us for six, we're not suppose to feel attracted to the selfish Dickie Greenleaf, but we do. His scrumptious performance is alluring, seductive. He is a scene stealer of major proportions. In the original, Maurice Ronnet's oily Dickie Greenleaf was a perfect lamb to the slaughter. We don't mourn his death and want the murderous Ripley, as played by Alain Delon, to get away with it. Here, when Jude Law is on the screen that's what we're looking at. We're prepared to forgive him anything and everything. I did believed in Gwyneth Paltrow's qualm, totally. In the original, Marie Laforet played it as a tenuous, unclear little excuse. Gwyneth Paltrow gives us a multi dimensional character and we go through her torment every step of the way. That, presumably, is merit in great part of Minghella's superb screenplay. Other joys are Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. On the minus side Matt Damon couldn't make me forget Alain Delon. His Ripley is a better written character than Delon's and his performance is top notch, but Delon was breathtaking on the screen. I think than Anthony Minghella was more interested in the inner workings of Ripley's mind that in the pyrotechnics of a implausible plot. Good. The semi confession of Matt Damon about a basement full of secret truths tells us about his pain about his fear. Delon's Ripley is amoral to the hilt. The murder of Dickie in the original is terrifying. It takes forever. As well as the getting rid of Freddy's body. Minghella never show us how Ripley managed to bring a dead body down the stairs. Clement spends a great deal of time with it. Making it enormously suspenseful. But, as I mentioned before we did care about Delon and, maybe, Minghella new that whether Damon got caught or not wasn't that important. All in all I liked the film very much and the biggest lesson from a film fanatic's point of view is: you don't kill your Jude Law half way through a film unless you leave us in the hands of someone who will make us forget him. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, remember that?",8,2005
"Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley gets a deluxe reincarnation here, merit of the talented Mr. Minghella. A sensational script adaptation, stunning Italian locations and an extraordinary supporting cast. Tom Ripley saw the light before, most memorably with the face of Alain Delon in another beautiful outing by the underrated Rene Clement. This time, the winning feature is the superbly tailored script that gets inside the heads of the characters giving us a full panoramic view of their privileges as well as their desolation. Tom Ripley, the amoral, becomes the tortured immoral here. Anthony Minghella gives him a conscience, a self-awareness giving the tale an extra chilling touch. Matt Damon's natural dullness works wonders here. This may be his best performance to date. But it is the supporting cast that makes ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fly so high. Jude Law as the spoiled, vain and ultimately cruel Dickie Greenlef is truly remarkable. His worthlessness, crystal clear for everyone to see, becomes irrelevant due to the astonishing charisma and oodles of sexiness that Jude Law exudes. That, in itself, makes Gwynneth Paltrow's character totally believable. She's an intelligent woman who must know Dickie for what he is but she puts that aside and we don't question it. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie is a fully fleshed out character who's on the screen for a few minutes but leaves and indelible impression. Great fun to witness his two faces. Creepy and wonderful. But it is Cate Blanchett, in a creation worthy of W Somerset Maughan that becomes the icing on this scrumptious cake. I would love to see a film where her Meredith is the central character. This ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" cemented my film relationship with Anthony Minghella. I wait for his films with childish anticipation.",9,2007
"I'd have to say The_Void really sums up on how amazing this film is and because I find his library of reviews so helpful, I will link them now: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur2248099/comments?order=date&start=0 His review should definitely take precedence over all other Reviews for this film (and probably a lot more). I write this review for the chance that if someone liked one of my opinions, they'd come and see what I thought of this masterpiece.",9,2010
"Patricia Highsmith's original novel is about a charming, amoral man who already has all the elements in place before he does his terrible deeds, and while Rene Clement's adaptation, PURPLE NOON(1960) doesn't show us Ripley before he came to Europe, Alain Delon certainly was all amoral charm.  In his adaptation, Anthony Minghella takes on a different tack, showing us Tom Ripley before he became the Talented Mr. Ripley(just as last year's ELIZABETH showed Elizabeth before she became The Virgin Queen; by coincidence, both films star Cate Blanchett).  When a filmmaker tries to add psychological depth to what is generally pulp entertainment, it doesn't always work, but Minghella has pulled it off, while keeping it entertaining.",10,1999
"First of all, I saw this movie twice, which is a rarety in itself these days.  The actors did what all actors should do in a successful motion picture, or stage play, and that is submit their own egos to the needs of the production.  Matt Damon especially surprised me with his total devotion to the part of Ripley.  Jude Law, once again, proved his talents as an actor by becoming Dickie Greenleaf.  Paltrow and Blanchett also totally believed in whom they were playing and brought that to the screen.  While I have been told that the movie is different than the book, I applaud Mingella for his tight script and seamless direction.  Yet again, we are given a prime example that when violence grows out of a strong plot we, as an audience, accept it.  There was not wasted motion or emotion in this film and I cannot say enough good things about it.  I am surprised that the Academy so overlooked this film.  Go see it.",10,2000
"I was so fascinated by Tom Ripley's character that I watched this movie again and again. There was something about him that I felt sympathetic towards on one hand and gave me the creeps on the other. Sympathetic because in more than one ways he is like you and me. He wants to be rich, he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech, he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.",7,2005
"Seeing this gorgeous tango between Damon and Law, I was never less than captivated and riveted. Minghella has fashioned something literate, powerful, seductive, charming, tragic, and beautiful. His casting is nearly perfect. Damon is unforgettable as an amoral but fascinating character whom we even sympathize with by film's end. Law is stunning as Dickie, the man whose life Ripley adores. Paltrow is good, though she is not given a whole lot to do. Blanchett is perfect in a small but pivotal role that only adds to her already impressive filmography. This is a near-masterpiece. Minghella's talent for visual opulence is second to none, and his work here should earn him a directing Oscar nod. The same goes for many others associated with this brilliant achievement. The ending is as unsuspected as it is inevitable, that is, sad and unsettling. In fact, the whole film underscores these emotions. Whereas Highsmith's original novel was cold and sometimes inert, the film makes Ripley much more of a living, breathing character, and as such, a great symbol of tragedy. It may be some time before I forget this intense experience. Certainly one that deserves multiple viewings. One of the best films of 1999. I think this may be one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Bravo everyone. A moving, rich knockout!",10,2000
"When it comes to naming the best films of the 1990's, The Talented Mr. Ripley hardly ever gets a mention. This is one of cinema's greatest mysteries; how can a film as well made, constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one I've just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep, complex characters and situations rich with double meaning, Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmith's original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered $1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie; the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex, disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie, his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...",9,2004
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It can definitely be considered an ""intelligent"" thriller.  And I think that Matt Damon made a good choice choosing this role.  He gets to explore the darker side of a character, a change for him, and he does so very well!  On the outside he appears so wholesome and harmless but if you watch his eyes, they can give you a chill. And I must say that Jude Law, an actor I had not seen much of before I saw this film, also gave a great performance.  He has great charm and you can almost understand why ""Mr. Ripley"" would go to such great lengths to possess his life. Damon did a good job of conveying how desperate he was to be someone with a life worth coveting.  Don't be put off by how long it is, it is worth the watch.",9,2000
"The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) really is one of the best crime thrillers I've ever seen. The film is set in late 1950's, it centers around Tom Ripley, a man who gets hired by Jude Law's father to go to Italy and persuade him to come back to America. When he does and gets to know him and his fiancé (Gwenyth Paltrow), things take a different turn.... The plot to this movie is very layered, and that is one of the many things that makes it great. One thing is for sure, if you like crime thrillers then you are sure to love this one. The acting is another great part about this movie. Almost all the actors were coming off of big hits when this movie came out, and every cast members great acting abilities are showcased. Matt Damon is absolutely fabulous here, it's probably the best performance I've seen him give in his career. And Paltrow's performance is very good here too... I loved her dramatic scenes, I really thought she nailed it. Jude Law and Cate Blanchett are good in their roles as well, I honesty think that Damon deserved an academy award nomination more than Law did. The writing in the movie elevates everything and really pulls it all together. Overall I 100% recommend this film this film to everyone! 10/10.",10,2017
The singular act of borrowing a Princeton jacket to play piano in place of an injured friend at a high class outdoor function becomes the catalyst in a series of life-changing events for Tom Ripley - a lowly lavatory attendant.,10,2017
"There are a lot of reasons to see THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. It is not your typical, run of the mill Hollywood thriller.  In fact, it is refreshingly chilling and Matt Damon turns in what is by far his best acting job to date. He is able to shed the ""Will Hunting"" image here with a juicy role.  It is a personality twisting story unlike, say, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE,  which was highly conventional and more of a slasher picture.  I would equate it more with Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA.  The audience is never totally clear as to why ""Tom Ripley"" wants to consume another personality which is all the more mysterious.",8,2000
THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY ,6,2004
"I have seen reviews of this film and people give it 5/10 and 3/10. It is just because they couldn't understand the film. I, myself found it intriguing and my eyes were glued the the screen. The story is amazing, the direction is fabulous and the acting is excellent. The story kept my ass glued to my seat the whole time, with no intention of getting up.",8,2000
Anthony Minghella's adaptation of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' possesses more depth and poses more questions than first viewings would indicate. At first viewing I was baffled by what motivated these people aside from simple selfishness on the part of the rich kids and class envy on the part of Tom Ripley. Since that first time I have thought about the various clues scattered along the way that Minghella throws out to help us along.,9,2006
'The Talented Mr Ripley' is a very silly film. It is a perfect example of how style can triumph over substance. From start to finish the plot is 100% nonsense. A geekish lavatory attendant (Tom Ripley/Matt Damon) stands in as an accompanist wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. This is enough for a shipping magnate in the audience to finance him to go to Italy and bring back his playboy son (Dickie Greenleaf/Jude Law).,5,2008
"This is an odd film. The first hour sets up Matt Damon's character, ""Tom Ripley,"" to do what he eventually does, kill someone and then imitate the rich kid off in Europe. However, to be fair, his murder of friend ""Dickie Greenleaf"" (Jude Law) is almost made to look like self-defense. It's an odd scene in this odd movie. As the story unfolds, however, ""Ripley"" is shown to be a sick killer, hardly some innocent man caught in some self-defense predicament.",8,2006
Tom Ripley is a bit of a non-entity but also a bit of a chameleon who can make people think he belongs. After the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf mistakenly thinks Tom was a friend of his son Dickie he is given a job to go to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to New York. He quickly meets Dickie and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood and befriends them. He is honest about why he is there but makes Dickie believe that they share similar interests. Soon he is staying with Dickie and Marge while still being paid by Dickie's father. Eventually Herbert Greenleaf writes to thank Tom for his work but also to let him know it is clear that he has failed in his task and will no longer be paid. At the same time Dickie starts to get tired of Tom's presence. Tom doesn't take this well and strikes Dickie; a struggle ensues and Dickie is killed. Tom manages to hide the death and carries on his life he also starts playing the part of Dickie; a role he enjoys. Inevitably the deception is hard to maintain; Marge wants to know what happened to Dickie and when a friend of Dickie pays a visit Tom must kill again to protect his secret a killing the police believe Dickie may have committed.,8,2017
"This is a really terrific thriller. There is a lot going on, and you need to bring your attention span, but the reward will be great if you do. Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley. Ripley is an intentionally ambiguous character who uses his many ""talents"" to dig himself into deeper and deeper trouble as he attempts to infiltrate high society. Damon really began to distance himself from boyhood chum Ben Affleck with this role originally intended for Tom Cruise.",10,2007
"A small-scale imposter / con man, making the rounds in 1950s New York, gets caught up in something much greater than his usual scam and decides to let it ride, if just to see where he winds up. In this case the answer is Italy, gorgeous vestige of the old world with just a few hints of the modern one, where he's tasked with convincing a flippant trust funder to return from a perpetual, fortune-draining holiday. That mission quickly goes by the wayside, just as soon as he realizes how much easier life is in the lap of luxury, and he merely exacerbates said money-letting as the wealthy playboy's new wingman. When things take a turn for the messy, though, his welcome worn thin and nothing to show for it but bittersweet memories, a panicked string of responses sends the entire comfortable lifestyle into a tailspin. At its root, Ripley is an example of how fear and rejection can press a normally smart, affable person over the brink into monstrosity, a surprise considering the playful tone of the first act. Matt Damon, still fresh from his breakout in 1997's Good Will Hunting, shows great versatility in the leading role (essential for such a complicated character), smoothly masking that twitch in his eye from all but the viewing audience. It's one of those films where you'll feel wrong about your rooting interest, knowing all along that the guy absolutely does not deserve a happy ending, with the final moments serving as your comeuppance.",8,2017
The Miramax Oscar hype is on and you are their pigeon!,4,2000
"I still don't quite understand why ""GQ"" never conquered the box office. The movie is clever, hysterically funny, surprisingly moving and, as one reviewer pointed out, more respectful of (and better at communicating) the ideals of ""Star Trek"" than any of the recent ""Trek"" movies or television incarnations. The script is inventive, the special effects are vivid and powerful (especially when the actors see the real ship for the first time, and when the rock monster rampages through the ship), and the characters are incredibly well drawn.",9,2004
"I generally rate films highly based on how often and how much I'd like to watch them again. I can watch most films more than once, but only a few have the necessary qualities to watch over and over again. Comedy films are never that high on my list of ""watch agains"". After seeing a joke or comic scene once, it's hard for it to have the same impact again and again. I well recall being in tears of laughter when I first saw Airplane at the cinema. But now I find it hard going and even the inflatable pilot only raises a smile.",10,2002

"The first thing that makes a good movie good is always a great story. The whole idea of actors from a long ago space series being mistaken for being the real deal by actual aliens is indeed ingenious.From there, you put together a top notch cast.They hit the nail on the head there. Tim Allen is a natural for the Jason Nesmith role.A great cast is nothing if they don't work well together.Not to worry.They are superb. This movie is an excellent twist on the old good vs.evil concept.There are movies whose ideas are so unique,you want to love them and not be disappointed.Take my word,Galaxy Quest delivers the goods.Warp speed!",9,2002
"This is what I would call a PERFECT film. As a long-time Star Trek fan I have waited for a movie which had that total feelgood factor, not a spoof, but a humourous and heartfelt homage.  A film which shows fans in a good light, in a way that, of course, we can laugh at ourselves, but in an unoffensive and entertaining manner. I never thought it would arrive, and so in GALAXY QUEST, I found one of the best films in cinema history. Everything is spot on.  The story is fantastic, and telling it from the point of view of normal people was great.  Making them play those stereotypes that we know and love was just the tip of the iceberg, and everyone played the parts superbly. The special effects speak for themselves.  When the Protector leaves space dock...Wow.   When she goes through the minefield...Wow!  When Tim Allen faces the biggest rock monster since The Never Ending Story...Wow Wow WOW! The score is also great, capturing the adventure of the old Star Trek shows, and the epic scope of the story at hand. And then there's the way everything just comes together at the end into a sensational package of laughs, thrills, sometimes bitingly moving scenes, and a genuine feeling of warmth inside. Go and see this, buy the DVD, whatever.  Just see it. Never give up, and never surrender!",10,2000

"Having a husband, who is a huge Star Trek nut, helped me sympathize with this hilarious film. After having been to half a dozen conventions in glory to this campy old sci-fi show, I have to say that this movie manages to target PERFECTLY every strange quirk and idiosyncrasy which surrounds ""fan boy"" groups.",10,2005
"I like a good spoof/comedy movie when it is done right. As far as spoof movies go though, there are those that are really unfunny and a waste of time which applies to 2001:A Space Travesty and anything by Friedberg and Seltzer. There is also the kind that has hit and miss moments but reasonably entertaining, Spaceballs in my opinions belongs under this category. And there is the spoof that work on every level, of which Young Frankenstein and this underrated gem Galaxy Quest fits like a glove.",10,2011
"SPOILERS ""Star Trek"" is a worldwide phenomenon. Watched by millions around the globe, the many series own a gigantic following and some of the most obsessive fans going. With regular conventions full of fans in costume, the whole Trek universe is one long opportunity for ridicule. In 1999 therefore, we were finally given a film which does it justice. Both spoofing the obsession as well as paying tribute to it, ""Galaxy Quest"" is a hilarious, under rated movie with an amazing comedy cast and some magnificent scenes.",9,2005
"A long time ago, I read a very entertaining & humorous short story in a book collection of Star Trek stories by fan authors, a whimsical piece about how several of the real Trek actors, such as Shatner & Nimoy, get zapped into the Trek universe, as if it was real, and are forced to enact their TV roles in a real setting. This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining, as a result. It begins rather mundanely - on purpose - during a standard science fiction convention, in which several actors, whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled sci-fi TV show, are relegated to these cheesy appearances, signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they've been reduced to. Well, except Tim Allen, who starts off very cheery until he has some ice water thrown in his face, a surprisingly effective moment. All the actors playing the actors fill out their roles very well. Tim Allen used to be the Capt.Kirk-type commander on the TV show; Weaver played his communications officer, like Uhura, and always repeated computer statements; Rickman was the alien doctor; Shalhoub was the Scotty-like tech man below decks; Mitchell was the pilot, like Sulu. Rockwell ends up along for the ride, even though he only appeared in one episode, as an expendable crewman.",8,2005
"Even though it's a comedy, it out-Treks almost all of the Star Trek films, with a better plot and better writing. The laughs are continuous and the dramatic elements are quite good.",9,2006
"Galaxy Quest isn't groundbreaking, but it's a charming and instantly likeable spoof on space dramas like Star Trek. With Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman in the leads you just know this will be good. The three leads make the movie consistently enjoyable and as they are good comedians, they bring in a lot of fresh and funny (if not light-hearted) material. ",10,2003
"I'd forgotten how good Galaxy Quest is until I caught it tonight on television, the first time I'd seen it since it was originally out in the cinemas. As other reviewers have said, it carries off an astonishing balancing act that manages to hit all the right notes, combining laugh-out-loud comedy with some genuinely moving scenes that could easily have teetered over into schmaltz.",8,2006
"Galaxy Quest is one of the best science fiction comedy I have ever seen. Even if you're not a science fiction fan, and/or a comedy fan, it is so brilliantly written, filmed and played, that you will laugh and enjoy yourself watching it. Fans of Star Trek with a good sense of humor can only love it. ",9,2005

The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I'm NOT exaggerating.

It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points.  The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original.

She spoiled this movie the first time I ever saw it because her range as a ""cartoon voice"" is non-existent.

It flourishes with originality and detail. Woody the cowboy doll and Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear return as the central toys. Woody anticipates Cowboy Camp with his owner Andy but a tear in his shoulder has him left on the shelf. A sudden yard sale calls for the rescue of another toy but in the process he is nabbed by greedy Al of Al's Toy Barn. We learn that Woody was part of the Roundup Gang, which was a canceled T.V. show. He is united with Bulls-eye the horse, prospector Stinky Pete and Jessica the high spirited female counterpart to Woody. During the search and rescue Buzz encounters another Buzz Lightyear as well as his arch enemy. John Lasseter returns as director accompanied by Ash Brannon and Colin Brody. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to voice Woody and Buzz. Joan Cusack steals scenes voicing Jessica whose musical segment involving her past is perhaps the most heartfelt moment in the film. Kelsey Grammar voices Stinky Pete who is contained in a box. Wayne Knight is hysterical as the human villain Al from Al's Toy Barn. One of the best sequels one could ask for.

"Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart. Woody and the gang are back in one of the best sequels ever made: Pixar's Toy Story 2. Here's something interesting. This film was originally a direct to video movie. But while in the process of making it, they realized how good it was turning out and decided to make it an theatrical movie. Thank Goodness, Pixar saw something in it, rather than continue the Disney's awful sequels cycle. The Pixar folks didn't want ""drop"" everything for the direct-to-video version. They make a brand-new story for the theatrical release because they wanted to; there was pressure from Disney to do a direct to video due to save money. The Pixar folks were sensing impending doom because they didn't know what to do, and as a last resort John Lasseter was called in from his long overdue vacation to fix the movie in time for its release. The process was rushed, messy, and nerve-wracking. But by God did it all pay off in the end!! Who knew that Toy Story 2 would partially lead to Disney's fall out with Pixar a few years later. Anyways the idea for the opening of this film was the original idea for the opening of Toy Story, only instead of a video game, it's a TV show. But the makers decided to scrap that idea and open the movie with play action with Andy, because they wanted to establish the bond between Andy and Woody in Toy story. Then when they made Toy story 2, they decided to bring back that idea only make it a video game. Still, that one impression video game for an early 2000's video game. My N64 and Playstation couldn't even be that good. The toys in Andy's room has just witness Woody (Tom Hanks) getting stolen by toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Now Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) must sent a rescue mission to save him. While at the same time at Al's penthouse, Woody finds out how much he is value, and thinks about being display in a toy museum along with Woody's Roundup pals Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar). The reasons is that, he knows deep inside of him that Andy will grow up one day and forget about him. The dilemma that Woody has, is a good dilemma and makes sense. In a way, foreshadowing Toy Story 3 so rather than being forgotten, he along with his new friends can be loved forever if he takes this chance with the museum in Japan. In the movie we get all the old characters of the first movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney in his last movie) as well as new characters such as Bulleye, and Weezy. I don't like how they forced feed us, Weezy. His character really came out of nowhere. Where was he in the original movie? Also check out, the scene was when Woody was being fixed up by the toy repairman, you might notice the toy repairman from the short film, Pixar's Geri's Game. The acting was pretty good, but Joan Cusack can be a bit annoying with her character. The story was well-written. The dramatic and emotional feel of the film has gotten better. The highlight back-story of Jesse just put you into tears, and that whole montage is told by one of the best songs in Disney's history. ""When somebody love me"" sung by Sarah McLachlan. I might not be a huge Randy Newman's fan, but the song works here. The humors works and I like how the film mocks old films and TV Shows like Star Wars and Howdy Dowdy. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love and is hence more fun. The visuals are break taking and the action is challenging to the eyes. I actually really liked the ""secret"" villain. I certainly didn't see it coming the first time I saw the movie, and I thought his motivation made sense, and kinda made me feel sorry for him. The fact that he never been loved and played with gave him a very different psychology from the other toys. The museum would be the closest thing to love he felt he'd ever have, so of course he's going to do anything for that, and isn't going to have much sympathy for Woody wanting to return to Andy. This movie isn't for toddlers. Let me get that straight for any first time parent. Its better off, when the child has mature enough aged to the point where it's can be deemed right to watch due to the large noises, large yelling and visual effects that can hurt a toddler's eyes. It's PG rating, people, not G. I really can't find much that was wrong with this film. It's just a great watch. So check it out if you haven't watch it already.",8,2013

"All I can say is, the Hollywood convention for naming sequels is unfortunate.  You don't see so many numerals in literature.  What would have happened if `The Lord of the Rings' had been called `The Hobbit 2'?  No-one would have taken it seriously.  If only someone could have found an alternate name for `Toy Story 2', I wouldn't have such a hard time convincing people that it's the second film that's the real triumph - the delightful masterpiece `Toy Story' was trying to be.",9,1999
"Cruel Intentions was my favorite movie when I was 14, to me it was everything I just wanted to be as a teen, despite how cruel and manipulative Katheryn was, I thought she was the coolest and strongest female character I'd ever seen on film. Now a couple years afterwards I read the book and saw the original Dangerous Liasons with John Malkovich and Glenn Close, I still very much enjoy Cruel Intentions. Like I said, this was just a terrific updated version of the ultimate story of love and betrayal, it was a little Dawson's Creek at times, but from what angle they went at, it was understandable. It had the biggest stars: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Reese Withersppon, Tara Reid, Joshua Jackson, and Selma Blair. May I say they gave extremely impressive performances, but the best without a doubt goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar, she was just ultimately brilliant as Kathryn Muertiel, the cruelist girl in school who's goal isn't to be the most popular, but to dominate everyone's innocence.",9,2001
"This movie gives a sexy, sensual twist to the stereotypical ""teen flick."" It communicates a new idea of sexuality amongst present-day teenagers, rather than the ""bang her and leave her"" mentality that is most commonly portrayed. I think the cast was very well chosen, and the dynamics of the cast were amazing. There weren't too many ""no names"" or ""B list"" actors, but on the other hand there weren't too many ""A listers,"" which would have thrown the focus off the plot. The music used in the movie was perfect because it accentuated the tone of the movie. ",10,2004
"I found this movie to be one of a kind, it was a lot better than I originally thought it would be, the name didn't make the movie sound too good, but after watching the movie I thought it was excellent. I found Reese Witherspoon's performance in this movie to be outstanding, I think SHE was the person who made the movie what it was. ",10,2004
"Cruel Intentions is the perfect romantic drama. This fruit did not fall far from the Romeo & Juliet tree. Romance, love, plots, and drama are all turned modern and splendidly rendered. Add to that a great soundtrack, beautiful shots, tension, hot eroticism, sex, and you get the perfect mix for that type of flick.",10,2012
"Cruel Intentions(1999) is a tame and lousy movie that never retains the sense of tragedy found in the Stephen Frears version of Dangerous Liaisons. It was a stupid idea to set it among high school teens(rich teens) because the characters in the film are angels compared to the French Aristocrats of the late 18th Century who were the most ruthless, extremely decandent and evil human beings around.  What I find amazing is that there are many people who are unaware that the first version of Dangerous Liaisons was done in 1960 by Roger Vadim with Jeanne Moreau with the setting similar to this film except with married adults involved.  The characters in the movie behaved like bad little children instead of the evil jerks that aristocrats were. This film is the worst version of the novel that its based on.",1,2000
"I am shocked that this movie is rated as highly as it is. It was offensive without being titillating, and gave little satisfaction for watching it in the end. Reece Witherspoon's character was never developed in the script so that you care what happens to her. Ryan Philippe's character is filled with bravado, but little else. Sarah Gellar's character is the only interesting one, and she seems to be a caricature. There is a surprising ending, but it is not much of a surprise. The technicals of the film are mostly fine--good lighting, interesting scenery outside and rich appointments inside. The sound was a bit difficult to hear on the VHS copy I saw. All in all, a waste of talent and time.",1,2011
"I saw this on video with a friend who had purchased the used copy from an ugly, awful chain video store.",1,2000
this movie had to be the worst film i have ever seen in my life.,1,2000
"Well, one thing for sure is that the previous three versions of Dangerous Liaisons have nothing to fear from this latest remake. After leaving the theatre I was hard-pressed to decide what the worst part of the film was. The cast are barely passable to pathetic, especially Ryan (54) Phillippe. The writing and direction turn the first half into an attempt to shock with repeated double entendres and sexual innuendo. It wants to be soft-core porn. And the second half is simply teenage soap opera played out so cheesily that it almost seems like a satire of itself - but don't give the filmmaker that much credit. In the end it was stupifyingly bad, an insult even to the younger teen audience to which it is obviously targeted.",1,1999
"CRUEL INTENTIONS, in my opinion, is an excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish. When Dr. Greenbaum (Swoosie Kurtz) pounded on her office window and yelled at Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) after Marci (Tara Reid) called her in tears, I really felt good. To me, the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the set was nice. Also, the scenes with Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) were excellent, too. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish to any Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, or Reese Witherspoon fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10,2005
"Did the world need a teen version of ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses""? Writer-director Kumble's screenplay is atrocious, veering from convoluted to mildly interesting to boring to ludicrous. Phillippe and Gellar look like little kids trying to play grown-up roles while the grown-ups (Fletcher, Kurtz, Baranski) simply look embarrassed. All the characters are uninteresting and one-dimensional. The dialog is so bad at times that it appears that Kumble is doing a spoof of the de Laclos novel except that any humor is purely unintentional. Phillippe's character is supposed to be a misguided and tragic hero or something but comes across as a confused and spoiled brat.",3,2007
"A few friends and I went to see ""Cruel Intentions"" when it first came out in the theatres. I had absolutely no idea what it was about, nor what to expect. Let's just say I left the theatre in a disappointed mood. The movie is shrouded with poor acting, a stupid plot, and nothing but cheap sex thrills for teenagers to swallow up. I myself am a teenager and found the movie to not only be disgusting, but a waste of time and money. I'm glad I'll never have to see this movie ever again.",1,1999
"""Cruel Intentions"" is something a sadistic look at other people through the eyes of two spoiled university brats. They view others as mere objects that are insignificant unless they are of some use or entertainment. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Kathryn Merteuil, her university's class president. She conveys a public image of sunshine and roses but behind closed doors carries out actions not better than a sociopathic slut. Her step-brother, Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) is of equal footing, living the life of a playboy whose ambitions favor the seduction of innocent young girls.",6,2005
"I saw this movie on the weekend expecting it to be good. I was pretty disappointed because it was really, really, bad. Not only did its ""f**k as many people as you can and you're cool"" morals annoy me (the two normal people in the film who did not screw everyone they could, were portrayed as not as cool as the two slutty people), but the acting and plot line were terrible as well. The plot was really thin especially at the end when Ryan Phillipe and Reese Witherspoon were supposed to fall in love and then you were supposed to feel sorry for him (what was that?). Anyway I suggest save your money and go see a good movie or if you must see it at least wait until it comes out on video.",1,1999
"Cruel Intentions is seriously a movie that gives me the chills, every time I watch it. Its bold, its daring, and downright chilling. The main thing I dug about Cruel Intentions, was the relationships, and the manipulation for there own benefits. Sebastian is used to getting his own way, he uses woman to sleep with them, and manipulates people for the hell of it, along with his sister Kathryn. What we don't know at the start of the movie, is how Sebastian has been affected by Kathryn. Then comes along Annette, who Sebastian figures will be his little toy, his own personal trophy so to speak. As much as I loved the relationship between Kathryn and Sebastian, I adored the one between Annette and Sebastian even more. We see this arrogant young charmer, who loves to mess people up, and as the movie progresses, we see the real him start to come out, thanks to Annette. Sebastian isn't used to fun, he's not used to genuine laughter, other than the laughter he got for his own amusement, and Annette gave that all to him.",9,2010
"How and why writer-director Roger Kumble brought to the screen this modern version of Stephen Frears' classic ""Dangerous Liasons"" (itself derived from an 18th century French novel via a stage play) is an interesting question. He was never going to improve on it, perhaps he just wanted to bring a classic tale to a wider audience. The darkly comic edge to the sexual decadence and idle cruelty of the privileged and bored is well honed but the overall effect is at times awkward. Making the characters a generation younger leaves the impression of watching the cast of ""The O.C."" reciting Moliere. The tale may (theoretically) be timeless but the characters don't translate entirely believably in to the modern world. The most entertaining performance is by Ryan Phillipe and it may be significant that he's almost parodying John Malkovich's Comte de Valmont from Frears' 1989 film. At the other end of the scale is Selma Blair who, when told her character is ""naive"", seems to have heard ""border-line retarded"". Ultimately ""Cruel Intentions"" is glossy, beautiful, and mannered, but a little shallow. and the ending (not helped by Sarah Michelle Gellar lacking the necessary dramatic heft for such a grand villain as Merteuil) is botched and insubstantial. Make what you will of the fact it spawned two sequels.",6,2007
"As far as really really good movies I've had the fortune of seeing recently the one that really stands out is a overlooked movie that came out last year called ""The Virgin Suicides."" The movie while one of the more depressing movies in recent memories is just brilliantly directed by first time director Sofia Coppola (it was also her first screenplay - quite impressive indeed). I thought you know going into this movie A) I'm a guy and B) depressing movies just sometimes make it really really tough for me to like the movie they have those endings where its like you emotionally feel like you have just fallen off a cliff... yet despite A) and B) I was very moved by this movie... the directing, cinematography, acting, music - all work extremely well hand in hand complementing each other. This movie will make you even more so want to enjoy every second and moment with those rare & special people you meet on the roads of life.",9,2001
"I had been meaning to see The Virgin Suicides since I first heard it was being released to film, based on its 1993 book by Jeffrey Eugenides. I never got around to it until the other night when I rented it on video.",10,2001
"A strange, surreal flight-of-fancy of death and love, remembrance and how romanticized our memories become. It's also very funny, tending to mix the black comedy of something like ""Heathers"" with the stifling suburban scenario of ""American Beauty"" (but it's better than both). Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the foxiest of five golden-toned sisters in the mid-'70s who feel trapped by their parents (a peculiar, but not overly monstrous couple), trapped by their feelings, trapped by time. They can breathe--and live freely--only in their fantasies (and perhaps in death), but do their realities represent a prison? It's the talent of writer-director Sofia Coppola not to push everything over-the-top; she's careful, she leaves the viewer contemplating the characters' motivations and actions. The situation is indeed unexplainable, yet it is in our nature to expect a resolution, to expect concrete evidence as to WHY and demand an answer. Yet there are no answers to the sadness of the strangers who live across the street, even as we pass through their lives and through their houses. ""The Virgin Suicides"" offers fascinating food for thought. *** from ****",7,2001
"Sofia Coppola's film is an adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides excellent novel of the same name. It is a beautiful, visually stunning movie, but it fails to capture the book's spirit.",7,2011
"I expected more from ''The Virgin Suicides''. This movie is told to be so good and even having a big name as Sofia Coppola helped me to have a big interest in watching it. But I found it a little bit boring, and also without a purpose: Okay, the girls committed suicide because they hated the life they were having with their horrible mother (Kathleen Turner) and called the boys because they wanted them to be witnesses of their suicide. And? I really lacked some reality in this movie. Not only from the parent's isolation from the world(come on,any teenager I know would try to escape from that horrible parents,me included) but some scenes after the Lisbon's girls died are so out of place, like the party where people uses gas masks.",6,2006
"I've searched for this movie more than two years, cause I've read the book and I do love it. It's one of the most beautiful stories about teenagers that had ever been written. The suicides of these five beautiful girls aren't to be taken seriously, it's a metaphor the author uses. He wants so write about the strange and often really terrible feelings teenagers have. And Sofia Coppola created an atmosphere I can't describe. Just as a light wind on a hot summer day, if you know what I mean. She's really one of the greatest young directors (especially female) of our time. ""Lost in Translation"" is a masterpiece as well. The actors were good, Kirsten Dunst is such a great actress, she should do more movies like ""The Virgin Suicides"", where she really has to act. Josh Harnett is wonderful as Trip and the girls who play Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia, are great discoveries. If you like films with depth, films you have to think about, this one here is remarkable for you. Please, watch it and immerse in the world of the Lisbon girls and the boys next door.",9,2005

"I can't believe it, that I actually sat through this crappy film, constantly hitting display on the good ol' DVD remote to see how much longer was left. And, while the movie only runs 97 minutes (including credits), it sure felt like an eternity!!! Hanna Hall plays Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest of the five Lisbon daughters, and is the first to off herself, even though it takes a second attempt before she succeeds, mind you. At first she tries in the tub with a razor, but that doesn't work. She goes to see a shrink (Danny Devito) who tells her parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner, who seems to be lost in this role) that he thinks Cecilia just did it for attention. The parents decide to have a little get together for the girls in their basement and invite some of the neighborhood boys over. Cecilia doesn't seem like she is having fun so she excuses herself and makes her way upstairs. A little while later, a noise is heard and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) and the rest of her daughters and the boys make their way upstairs and out the front door, where Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) is holding Cecilia, who is draped over a fence, the spike in her back. She jumped out of the bedroom window and succeeded in offing herself this time. I found the acting by Kathleen Turner in this part to be just down right pathetic.",3,2007

"Sofia Coppola's film is not unlike the music provided by Air for its soundtrack: nice, but a little bit hollow. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this film, just like all in all, I enjoy Air's music when someone puts on one of their CDs during a dinner party (Air is a favourite of many people who have dinner parties that I know). Air's music is immaculately packaged, unobtrusive, tasteful and on the whole, unobjectionable. Coppola's film is exactly the same. Liking Air and liking The Virgin Suicides is, if not a complete, absolute and irrefutable sign of having good taste, at least not a sign of having bad taste, that's for sure. But what exactly was this film about? The meaninglessness, hypocrisy and hollowness of suburbia and ""respectable"", bourgeois society (a favourite target for many artists). The voyeuristic nature of the media (another popular one). The spontaneity and genuineness of the young (epitomised by Cecilia, the youngest sister in the film), a spontaneity etc which is killed off and sucked dry by the stifling, unwritten rules of respectable, middle-class, white American society. The slow but steady death of nature at the hands of the human race. Yadda yadda. Can I object to any of these themes? No, of course I can't. They're all worthy themes and the film was nowhere near preachy about any of them. Credit to Coppola for that. As I said, this film is very tastefully done. I'm not sure though: The Virgin Suicides could be about some if not all of these things and more besides, yet it remains soft in focus, ""airy"" (not just in the soundtrack) and somehow, void of substance. Yet I cannot say I wasn't enjoying it as I was watching it, just as I cannot say I haven't enjoyed listening to Air playing in the background at a dinner party. But the enjoyment was never more than skin-deep. And to be honest, though I've been left with nothing negative from this film and the fashionable French band's music, I've also not been left with anything positive either - nothing that lasts, nothing to keep. This is all just... an unobjectionable lack of real substance with a very clever, unobjectionable appearance of substance. All very tastefully done, of course. 5/10",5,2005
"First in ""The Godfather 3"", now with ""The Virgin Suicides"".  What was the point of this movie?  Was it:",1,2000
The virgin suicides tries to be a thought provoking movie by being slow and boring.  One might try to find a surprise conclusion as to why each of the daughters committed suicide besides the obvious fact that the parents were very strict disciplinaries.  The odd thing is that normal teens would not be as submissive but instead retaliate such strict rules. ,1,2000
"This adaptation of the book is hardly worth a mention. I'm only writing because I was so appalled by it watching it the second time (the first being in the theater some years back). Watching it last evening, I couldn't get through the first sixty minutes and had to turn it off (this rarely happens). The book, which I'd read between my first viewing and the ill-fated second, is an amazing exploration of the decay of an American era and the explosive domestic drama that results thereof, in a world where physical reality and society (personified in the film by the Church primarily) collide. It is a book about men and our inability to access women, thus also our emotionally ""gooey"" sides. It is a tragedy in that great tradition, so much so that the tragedy within the narrative transcends the narrative itself to comment on a greater tragedy... which is what good art can do.",1,2007
"I was really looking forward to seeing The Virgin Suicides, even though I've seen it seriously panned by some critics. Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to agitation very early into the film, which actually felt more like an after school special than a poetic movie about ""Love Sex Passion Fear Obsession"". Wasn't this supposed to be something of a black comedy, too? The maudlin narration, done 25 years after the events which turned the Lisbon sisters into objects of further obsession by the neighborhood boys, begins the unfortunate descent.",1,2000

Their beauties attract the attention of a group of boys that meet in the house on the other side to watch the girls. When Cecilia commits suicide, the girls stay at home for a period, returning to school later. When the handsome football player Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) seduces Lux and spends the night outside with her, Mrs. Lisbon locks the girls at home, leading them to commit massive suicide.",8,2006
"After viewing this film, I've become interested in reading the book it was adapted from. Not because the movie struck me as a stunning masterpiece, but rather in the hopes the book will do a better job of telling a potentially good story.",5,2008
"...this movie is awkward and interminable! An absolutely pretentious piece of twaddle defined by both a lack of focus and a failure to present believable characters, ""The Virgin Suicides"" is ample proof (if any was needed) that nepotism will get you everywhere in show business. This film suffers from a lack of point-of-view (I dare you to define who the protagonist really is) and, even more importantly, a lack of point! We are never made to care one whit for the lives (or deaths) of the Lisbon sisters, nor are we shown any traits that make us interested in the creepily voyeuristic boys who adore them for no ascertainable reason. From the pretentious voice-overs to the first-year film school blocking of scenes, this is an amazing waste of time and resources. ""The Virgin Suicides"" must certainly be in the running for worst film ever made. And Sophia Coppola, already reviled as an actress, has proved she can't direct, either. See ""Lost in Translation"", a nausea inducing movie about a crybaby child of privilege meeting a washed up actor with no amount of charm at all, for further reference.",1,2001

"This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy McManus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go! Two of the most interesting characters in the film are played by veteran actor William Dafoe, and a newcomer to the silver screen, David Della Rocco. Dafoe's character is Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent specializing in organized crime...Rocco plays an Italian Mafia package boy who is a close friend to the Irish brothers...the central theme of the film is the indifference of good men...Connor and Murphy are not indifferent, and after helping their friend, Doc, the two embark on a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of criminals...with the assistance of their comical and zany friend, Rocco...This film had positive elements on all sides...humor...a moral message...and incredible actors...you will no doubt find yourself repeating the many memorable quotes from the film...I am a woman, and not at all into your typical ""shoot 'em up"" guy films...this is not another one of those films...it has become an underground ""cult"" sensation...See it...you will not be disappointed!",10,2002
"Very intelligent action movie, about two Irish brothers who kill 'sinners' to punish them. The movie is a bit different from the typical action movie, as it doesn't have car-chases or explosions. The action consists of stylish shooting sprees. It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers punishing criminals. It's a different kind of vigilante movie. It's particularly gory and bloody, but this just makes it all the more realistic. In real life, there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie has some Christian subtexts, I think I've heard about five major theories about the whole movie's meaning. This shows, in my opinion, that there was obviously a lot of thought put into the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stand the gore, even if they aren't Christians. 10/10",10,2004

If you haven't had the chance to catch this flick, go out and rent it! it's one of those movies that shouldn't be missed. I guarantee that once you see it you'll be quoting it left and right. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have amazing chemistry together, and David Del Rocko just adds the comedic relief that makes the trio one thats hard to take your eyes off of. ",10,2004
"The Boondock Saints is the epitome of an over-hyped movie that people will themselves into believing to be better than it actually is. And, on first glance, it does look like a decent movie. But when you look closer, it becomes extremely apparent that it's all flash and no substance. Duffy masks the contrived plot and silly, inexplicable motives for characters with violence. Characters become superheroes on a whim, no one is developed to the point where emotional development has zero impact. Instead, the film plays up the emotional moments as over-the-top as possible to cram that emotional value into your head.",4,2006

Then Il Duce turns out to be daddy! And the way the director condescends to his audience is a joke. Wanna see how all of the dead bodies got to be that way? Wait a minute and I will will show you.

"I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off. I saw the unrated edition of ""The Boondock Saints"" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth. Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days. Writer-director Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the ""law,"" and its apparent futility in modern times, and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers, Conner and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles), to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of ""The Boondock Saints"" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough, both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim self-defense. They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed. But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one (most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition), with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the f-word and assorted Irish-Euro-slang, and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. (It's easy to see why, if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S.: The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture.) I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long, darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in ""The Boondock Saints,"" and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly, I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding ""The Boondock Saints"" as one possibly can; it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.",10,2006
"Why is Willem Dafoe in this movie? It demeans him. It starts well enough, with two Irish blue-collar brothers ridding the world of some Russian mafia scumbags. However, it soon devolves into the worst kind of bad acting, improbable situations, and ridiculous developments that you've ever had the misfortune to see. Ron Jeremy is one of the best actors in the film -- that should tell you everything! He's actually better at playing his scumbag role than Dafoe is.",1,2007
"I suppose I can see how so many people could've been hoodwinked into thinking this was a good movie. It just piles a bunch of ""cool"" imagery and ideas together and flings them onto the screen. ""Boondock Saints"" is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while. The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks. But line them up in front of one man in broad daylight and they're lucky to escape with their lives. Speaking of shallow cool and that particular gunfight... It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters, each containing a badass looking handgun in slow-motion. So while he's constantly running out of bullets and, lightning-quick, whipping out a new gun, the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded. That's one of the main problems with this movie, it can't decide if it's going to be one of those ""reload during a gunfight"" flicks or a ""just keep shooting and never run out of bullets"" flicks. Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself (""THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!!), it actually shows you that it doesn't get its own joke.",1,2007
"worst movie I've seen in a while. this movie will appeal to younger viewers who haven't seen a lot of good films and who think that a movie with an absurd plot and lots of shooting is ""awesome"". All the Big Movies nowadays have these ""cartoon stereotyped characters"" and absurd situations and dialog that passes for originality.",1,2006
"Quite possibly the most overrated film of all time; maybe even the worst film of all time. Far from the great streetsmart action film that it is praised to be, Boondock Saints is a severely banal and contradictory film that contains poor acting, poor accents and even poorer performances. From the two brothers who are flawed, contradicted and pathetic characters, who are in the movie to tote guns and sport bible lines all to a hip soundtrack and Troy DUffy's pathetically uninteresting vision. THis movie is sacrificed to be what it became- pure Hollywood movie-making; produced only to make money and look entertaining, filled with archetypes where everything leads to something else, with no point and no vision. THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why? why is he gay?) lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know. That and the fact that their dad joins in the cause. THe whole movie sums it up; we don't know. And it sucks.",1,2006
"I heard nothing but rave reviews for this movie.  One of my best friends stared at me incredulously when he heard that I had never seen ""The Boondock Saints.""  Apparently, it's reached cult status.  Well, with all the hype surrounding the movie, I reserved it on Netflix.com and I couldn't wait to receive it in the mail.  Last night, I watched it with a friend.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a review about it today.",1,2003
"Was this a 14 year old's middle school theater project? Just plain horrible, and I know Willem Dafoe hasn't had the greatest career ever, but he is a real actor, and I don't know why a real actor would ever waste his time in this straight to video junk.",1,2005
The Boondock Saints was released in 1999 and ushered in a fan base possessing cinematic principles rivaling those of The Godfather Part III supporters.,1,2009
"This movie was recommended to me by a couple friends. It was vehemently endorsed by other friends. So I rented this movie at their insistence. I no longer wish to speak to these people. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Little to nothing of the plot was believable. The casting was horrible. The acting was worse, and worst of all... ",1,2006
"The absolute best thing about this film are the knockout performances by it's 2 main stars Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie though both characters (hence performances) are very different they stand out nonetheless.  It seems to me to be somewhat easier to play a psychotic than to play a regular neurotic, so who really has the better portrayal of the two?",8,2000
I came to the film with low expectations.  I was simply stunned by how good it was.,9,2000
"It's always tough in today's goal-obsessed society to be someone who isn't quite sure what they want, but woman and minorities especially have it tough, because they seem to be automatically assigned ""roles"" for them(if you're a woman, even today, people still ask you when you're going to get married; if you're black and look big, people ask if you're an athlete).  In the 60's, author Susanna Kaysen was in a similar position; she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life, but knew she didn't quite fit into the norm.  Because of that, and because of some legitimate problems(she tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin), she went into a mental hospital and was tagged with having ""borderline personality disorder,"" a catch-all phrase which meant whatever the doctors wanted it to mean.  From her experiences in the hospital, Kaysen wrote the book GIRL, INTERRUPTED(the title comes from a Vermeer painting), and now comes the movie version from James Mangold and Winona Ryder.",9,2000
"In more ways than one, 'Girl Interrupted' is very similar to 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. To begin with both the films are set in mental institutions and chronicle life as it unfolds amidst those bland, white walls. Characters in both the film are acutely lifelike. But owing perhaps to it being a true story, 'Girl Interrupted' has characters that are much easier to identify with than McMurphy's brigade. Set in the 60's, the film is an account of the times spent in the Mental Institution by an eighteen year girl, Susanna Kaysen, a character portrayed with astonishing brilliance by the versatile Winona Ryder.",7,2002
"How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.",9,2000
"GIRL, INTERRUPTED / (1999) ***1/2 (out of four)",9,2001
"My eighteen year old daughter and I went to see this movie last night, it was excellent! A must see! Even though I cried through the whole last hour of this movie, it was not a sad film, but a lifting of the human ""spirit""! Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie were magnificent. The supporting cast was outstanding. I was amazed when reading the credits at the end that Winona Ryder was an executive producer. Angelina Jolie deserved her Golden Globe Award, she should definately get an Oscar nod if not the win. Winona Ryder deserves some accolades for this wonderful and very enlighting film! Kudos to everyone involved. A Masterpiece!",10,2000
"First the IMDb rating is much too low - duh! -- EVEN IF you overlook the near-perfect script, direction, casting, sets -- even if you overlook that the movie is engaging and solid on its own, you end up with the inescapable fact that, FROZEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT IN TIME, you have in front of you two of the most perfect faces Hollywood has ever produced.",9,2015
"SPOILERS Let's be honest for a moment. As humanity settles itself into a new millennium, there are so many aspects of life which we remain ignorant about. One aspect in particular is the realm of the human mind. With countless philosophical theories designed to explain the interaction between the brain and the body, science is still at a major loss to explain it. In the modern world we deal with the mentally ill through discussion and pumping them full of drugs. It's a practise which has been in use for decades in one form or another and it remains a practise which treats the ill with a varied degree of success.",8,2005
"I started out thinking that in no way this movie could be as good as the book. I was very familiar with Susanna Kaysen's work, and was preparing myself to be disappointed with this film. However, no such thing happened. I loved this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone with vision enough to watch it. This movie went beyond the book, adding likability to the characters as it progressed. Winona Ryder did an excellent job portraying the protagonist, and Angelina will make you rewind parts over and over again, especially the part with the cat puppet, which I still say was far too short. Clea DuVall plays the part of Susanna's roommate, and gives one of her best performances yet. This is by far my favorite film by James Mangold, and as I said earlier, I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good story.",8,2006
"From the years 1800 to 1960, very little progress was made in the understanding or treatment of mental illness. Part of this stagnation had to do with the fact that religious repression of medical science was still being shaken off at the time, but the biggest culprit was the inability of society to wake up and realise that just because a fat suit behind a desk said all was well didn't necessarily make it so. Given that Australia calls itself the ""lucky country"" in spite of having the highest youth suicide rate in the entire world, it doesn't appear that we'll be getting over that hurdle any time soon.",8,2003
"Okay, okay...  so the movie is decent.  The actresses were fabulous.",5,2002
"Not only a bad film, but perhaps a dangerous one, this movie betrays the serious and thoughtful book on which is was based in favour of asylum-as-summer-camp hijinx. The author's original critique of the system is replaced with a knuckle-under philosophy that plays into the hands of a system that the book shows may or may not have created some of the very diseases it claims to treat. Apart from a great performance by Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted has nothing to recommend it and much to its discredit.",1,2003
Angelina Jolie won a rightfully deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance alongside Winona Ryder in this drama which documents a period of time in which a young woman experiences life in an insane asylum.,7,2008
"After being touched by the sensitive film ""Heavy"", I couldn't wait to see what would happen with director James Mangold. This brash, barbed, insightful and touching drama is the result, and although it has problems, you end up caring about a lot of people you might otherwise try to avoid. Winona Ryder's performance as a young woman being treated for psychological problems in the all-girl wing of an institution in the late 1960s is very fine; she's mannered at times and a little coy, but she seems a sweet puppet with her wires cut, a bobbing head doll, and one never grows tired of her. Angelina Jolie won a Supporting Oscar as the lead troublemaker, and it is a ferocious bit of acting, but her character is an enigma--playful at times, then cruelly straightforward--and Jolie has to work extra hard to give her depth. I was perplexed by some of Mangold's touches (like having one character commit suicide while listening to the Skeeter Davis record ""The End of the World"", ha ha); but the sneaky trip away from the hospital that Ryder and Jolie take is an amazing section that works rough magic all on its own. Whoopi Goldberg isn't bad as the main nurse on the floor, but a complacent Goldberg is an automatic anticlimax and I don't understand Mangold's casting here. However, the film displays on occasion the work of someone wonderful breaking through, and there are many heartfelt sequences, quick and quirky editing techniques. For anyone bemoaning the obvious (""Not another institution movie!""), this should be a pleasant surprise. *** from ****",7,2005
"It's always a simple task to relegate a movie or piece of work to a niche in the wall, claiming that it borrows or steals from one thing or another.  In the case of ""Girl, Interrupted,"" it's very easy to say ""It's a 'Cuckoo's Nest' with girls.""  Looking at things on such a superficial level, one could argue that every story steals from all those before it.  But the truth of the matter is that certain ideas are so fundamental, so classical, that they have applied to us for as long as anybody can remember.  If basing a movie on a mental institution and its patients concocts triteness, then basing a movie on love is as much of a sin.",9,2001
"Anyone who has ever had an obsession, felt impulses to be drastic over something inconsequential, felt a bit out of place, or ever had in the back of their mind the sinking suspicion that they might be just a little bit crazy should see this film. Girl, Interrupted is rather self-indulgent, like watching children attack a bowl of Halloween candy, or witnessing family members playfully fighting over the last piece of pumpkin pie.",6,2000
"Renting this movie, I was expecting the typical nutcase/heart warmer and that about sums it up. Ryder has once again failed to take over the movie and keeps her name on my list of underachievers in Hollywood. Jolie takes over as psycho-Lisa and while the rest of the characters are believable, you don't really get to learn about any of them except Daisy, who is out of the joint before the halfway point. I still don't understand the relationship between Susanna(Ryder) and her parents. ""Don't worry mom/dad, I'll just forget that you led me to the nuthouse and didn't even drop me off, but paid a taxi"". For a self-rightous woman, Susanna gave in pretty easily into signing the papers getting her into the clinic. Overall, the movie was alright, but didn't seem to want to find an ending. Plus, the ending seems to be done quickly and actually becomes only the 2nd in what could be 3 different endings in the movie. That was cool in Waynes World, but not here. 5 out of 10.",5,2000
"It's hard not to like ""Big Daddy"", though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of the comic actor.  For although this film has raised the hackles of a number of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged.  Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona.  ""Big Daddy"" might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.",7,1999
"While all of the somphoric pre-teens will be giggling silly at the childish potty jokes shown in AUSTIN POWERS 2, the real adults will be laughing their heads off in a much funnier film called BIG DADDY.  This is Sandler's sixth starring role feature, and it seems that the sixth time is a splending charm.  This is Sandler's best work yet! Now in case you are wondering, I enjoyed both HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WEDDING SINGER.  But there's something charming and wonderful on why I enjoyed BIG DADDY more.  Perhaps it's seeing a over-grown kid taking care of a little boy.  Or it's Sandler mixing his in your face attitude that he gave in HAPPY GILMORE with his soft-spot attiude from THE WEDDING SINGER.  Whatever it is, it works, and it works very well! The simple plot of BIG DADDY is a 5 year old child is left on the doorstep of Sandler's apartment.  It turns out to be the child of his roommate (Jon Stewart), who's on his way to China for a legal case.  So what is Sandler to do, but to give him to the child protective service.  But it's a holiday, and they are closed, so Sandler keeps him for a day, then another day, and... well you get the picture. But the plot doesn't matter much with this film, it's the laughs, and you do get plenty of those.  But you also get a wonderful supporting cast. There's a good support from Jon Stewart, the always wonderful and beautiful Joey Lauren Adams, Leslie Mann, and Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer). And what's a Sandler movie like if you don't have his usual character actor friends in small comic roles; Rob Schrieder, Steve Buscemi, Josh Mostel, Allen Covert (the caddy from HAPPY GILMORE who was also the limo driver friend in THE WEDDING SINGER), and Jonathan Loughran (the lazy-eyed football player in THE WATERBOY).  There's even a funny cameo role by director Dennis Dugan, as the man who refuses to answer the door on Halloween, while Sandler is taking his adopted son trick or treating. This film was a lot more funnier that THE WATERBOY, it was also funnier than THE WEDDING SINGER and HAPPY GILMORE.  It was believe it or not, more touching.  You can understand why Sandler doesn't want to let this boy go, since he reminds him so much of himself.  And Sandler sees that being a father figure isn't only fun, but it redeems himself from the lost of his girlfriend. I have to give both Sandler and director Dennis Dugan (the same director of HAPPY GILMORE) a round of applause.  They teamed up for a comedy that is not only successful, but will make A LOT of money. Sandler and Dugan are the best comedian/director team since the late John Belushi and John Landis.  I'm just hoping that they will continue to do films together in the futrue.  Until then, take your date, your friends, or heck just go alone and enjoy one of the funniest comedies (next to ANALYZE THIS, ELECTION, and RUSHMORE) of this year. This is a wonderful treat!  ****1/2 (out of five)",7,1999
"Big Daddy- Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is the irresponsible guy - he  has no manners, and no clue. Although Sonny has somehow managed  to get a girlfriend, she is tired of his aimless ways, and gives him an  ultimatum - do something with your life or I leave. Fate steps in with  a ready-made 'solution': Sonny will raise the little boy who was  dropped off at the apartment with a note proclaiming his roommate (Jon  Stewart) the father, his girlfriend will realize his newfound  responsibility, and all will be well.  Plausibility this movie doesn't have. But we are talking about Adam  Sandler, the man who has given us such brainteasers as Happy Gilmore,  and Billy Madison. Sandler's frat-boy humor - childish and,  scatological - has however, drawn a huge following as evidenced by The  Waterboy's huge box office, (a movie that I myself enjoyed and will  surely be pilloried for).  I expected one thing from this movie - a good laugh. And it delivered.  The obligatory tearjerker scenes were painful, but thankfully few and  far between. If you are in the mood for some humor-light on cheap  Tuesday, give this movie a chance.",6,1999

"I am not a Sandler fan in the least, in fact for the most part I do not enjoy his movies. Still, this one was a rather funny little comedy even if it did have a rather unbelievable premise. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get girl back by taking in a kid who may or may not be a friend of his kid. So aside from that you have your funny scenes of Adam trying to raise a small boy to the best of his ability while also getting the attention of a new female in his life. Granted some of the jokes were just lame such as Sandler dressing up as the boy's favorite toy, but for the most part the jokes were hits. It did tend to get a bit sentimental towards the end, but not as bad as other movies of this type tend to get. Jon Stewart is in this one as is Sandler buddies Rob Snider. Steve Bushemi is also in it, but his appearance in the movie is rather stupid. So for a rather good comedy that isn't really great, but not unbearable like many Sandler comedies can get try this one on for size.",7,2007
"Adam Sandler (The Waterboy, The Wedding Singer) has pulled off another hit with Big Daddy.  Sandler stars as a lazy law-school graduate who won't take the bar exam.  One day when his roommate goes on a business trip to China a child arrives at the day with a note claiming to be his roommate's son. Sandler takes the kid for a day and after having a good time decides to keep him to impress his girlfriend who doesn't think he's trying to grow up. His girlfriend dumps him and he's stuck with the kid.  Not surprisingly Sandler isn't a good father, but soon he bonds with the kid and he learns how to be a good father.  This might sound like a cheesy feel-good film, but with Sandler the humor is kind of low-brow, but often hilarious.  The film does also offer a few touching scenes between Sandler and the kid.  Sandler's performance was very funny, but reminded me a little of Jim Carrey's performance in Liar Liar.  Liar Liar if you have seen it was a regular Carrey comedy, but offered a couple of serious scenes which Carrey pulled off well.  Carrey then went on to do The Truman Show and win a Golden Globe. Sandler also has a couple of serious scenes which he nails well.  I'm not suggesting that Sandler is going to become a great actor (like Carrey seems headed for) but he may have the skill to do it if he wants.  Leslie Mann (George of the Jungle, The Cable Guy) and Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, A Cool Dry Place) are both good as sisters.  Jon Stewart (The Faculty, Playing by Heart) is solid as Sandler's roommate.  Twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse are convincing as the kid.  Finally, two favorites of mine have very funny supporting roles.  Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, Armageddon) is good as a homeless friend of Sandler's.  And Rob Schneider (Judge Dredd, Knock Off) is hilarious as an immigrant delivery man who is good friends with Sandler. Highly Recommended.",8,1999
"""Big Daddy"" has the misfortune of premiering in 1999, when the field for Most Pathetic Film of the Year is loaded with flicks like ""Idle Hands"" and the runaway winner so far, ""Baby Geniuses"". But give Adam Sandler credit: He took a decent budget, backing from a historic studio and a couple of well-respected co-stars and managed to come up with the most disgusting, stupid and unwatchable piece of cinematic garbage this summer.",1,1999
"I wasn't sure what was worse -- the muscle cramps that accompanied cringing at the horrible sentiment scenes, or the strain that resulted from rolling my eyes so often at the supposed humor.",1,2002
"Boy, did this movie suck. Even though it's only 90 minutes, it felt like it lasted 4 hours. Happy Gilmore was OK, but Sandler's other works have really blown. One reason i didn't like it is that Sandler's character is a jerk. He yells like a moron in a McDonald's, harasses a man (the film's director) in his apartment, spoils the kid, and causes bodily harm to skaters.",1,2000
"Adam Sandler, once again he proves that you cannot go broke underestimating the taste of the US public. There must be hypnosis used to draw people to his movies. What I saw was entirely forgettable. Aside from someone slapping their kid around because they wouldn't stop talking (in the audience), there was nothing of mention in the movie. Adam Sandler makes Pauly Shore sound entertaining. If you liked 'Water Boy,' 'Biodome,' or 'Manos, Hands of Fate' you might be able to enjoy this film...",1,1999
"The whole premise in Big Daddy is unlikely. A lazy bum finds a kid delivered to his doorstep and in order to impress his girlfriend, decides to take care of him until a better home can be found. He then goes on to teach him everything he knows about life. Which amounts to about...nothing.",4,2006
"Okay, I watched this movie and thought it had some good sequences, but then again, it was just corny. Like at the very end at the court hearing when everyone grabbed their cell phones and called their dads while sobbing - that's just utter crap. Apart from that I don't like Adam Sandler, which I concede is a personal bias. Nonetheless it HAD some witty sequences, although most of them did not seem genuine and are unlikely to occur in reality. I mean the basic approach was generally fairly good, but some scenes are simply too far-fetched. There are much more substantial movies out, so we definitely needn't praise this one too high. It would have been much better if the storyline had a stronger emphasis on the interpersonal burdens and struggles and less on the comedy aspect. Here again Adam Sandler was just the wrong actor to aim at such a transformation.",5,2005
"Big Daddy is clearly and with out a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. From the terrible, repulsive, acting, to the soggy story, to the bad acting, an awful film. Adam Sandler gives one of the worst performances in the history of film. What was he doing in this movie? Did he want to be in it? It doesn't appear so as his performance has no life whatsoever. His scenes are painful to watch and he's painfully not funny. The whole movie is. Jon Stewart, and Rob Schneider are also horrendous. The women in this movie are totally and completely wasted.      The story is so far-fetched and implausible it would be dumb to describe it.       One of the worst films ever made. A far to generous ONE is what I had to rate this piece of blank.",1,2001
"For the most part, ""Big Daddy"" is the average Adam Sandler movie, with him as slacker messing with the status quo. But this one certainly does have some intelligence to it. Portraying Sandler adopting a boy (twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), the movie certainly gives adoption a good name, even if it uses complete silliness to do so. It's mostly interesting how the movie shows that he has to mature more in the process of raising this boy.",7,2006
"Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is an unemployed layabout who claims that he is unable to work due to an accident he had involving a cab from 2 years ago. Sonny is a self-absorbed individual who generally thinks of no-one but himself much to the annoyance of his girlfriend. However, when a 5 year old boy named Julian (Cole Sprouse) ends up on his doorstep, Sonny claims to have adopted Julian in order to try and win back his girlfriend and prove himself worthy of her affections. Whilst Julian is in Sonny's care, Sonny does some growing up himself in the midst of some rather questionable antics as a caretaker parent.",6,2015
"This was a horribly unfunny movie.  I just don't get this Adam Sandler phenomenon.  He's just not funny, at least in a movie. The jokes are so tired and stale.  I can always see the joke coming in an Adam Sandler movie. Wait, here it comes, hold on, almost there, HA!  Oh boy that was funny.  I guess you have to be not too bright to like his movies, or maybe I'm not bright enough (although I doubt it), I just don't know.  I love Monty Python, I like the Farrelly brothers' movies (especially Kingpin), I even chuckle at the Ace Ventura movies.  The one Adam Sandler movie I enjoyed was Happy Gilmore, where Sandler was his usual obnoxious self but was actually funny.  Wedding Singer was tolerable, probably due to the presence of Drew Barrymore.  The Waterboy was horribly overrated as well, although it was better than Big Daddy. In Waterboy, at least some of the supporing characters are mildly amusing, although Sandler himself is perhaps at his most annoying.  I like Jon Stewart and Joey Lauren Adams (and Steve Buscemi is usually one of my favorite actors), but they cannot overcome the horrible dialogue and the terrible comic timing.  The kid is so cute he's just annoying, and Adam Sandler is flat as a pancake.  The worst thing in the movie, though, is the agonizingly, putridly unfunny Rob Schneider, who should thank Sandler for giving him bit parts so that he can pay his rent.  Schneider's unnecessary bit as the restaurant worker is exceeded in annoyance factor only by his HORRID cameo as the ""you can do it"" guy in The Waterboy.  I wish Adam Sandler well, I just hope that he can put out a movie one day that is actually deserving of the popular acclaim he is now receiving.  Of course, with the fickleness of the public, that movie would probably bomb.",1,1999
"This was the first Adam Sandler movie I saw. I must say that I was impressed. Sandler plays Sonny who is just a cheap, low-life guy who works at a tollbooth and he has family issues. Then one day, a 5-year-old kid was dumped on his doorstep. He decides to take care of the kid even when there is legal trouble involving him and the kid. I thought that Dennis Dugan did a good job as directing. The chemistry between the actors was OK, but it works. There were fine performances by the Sprouse twins, Rob Schneider, and Jon Stewart. I also liked the music of this film. I enjoyed listening to the two versions of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" by Sheryl Crow and Guns'N'Roses. Last of all, the film was pretty funny. This is a nice fit for your movie collection! I rate this movie a 8/10.",8,2007
"It's amazing to think that at the turn of the century Adam Sandler was hyped as being on the brink of mega stardom . Even more amazingly he was at one point the world's highest paid movie star ! No doubt his loyal fans ( All three of them ) can reconcile themselves with being first in line to see his next blockbuster performance since no one in 2005 queues to see a Sandler movie , especially if it's released direct to video ",4,2005
"I was highly suprised to see such negative things about this movie. To think, that people can have so much hatred for a MOVIE! get over it people.",10,1999
"""Big Daddy"" is a diluted, sappy, and truly dumb film. The only redeeming quality of this picture is, well, the little kids that played Julian were pretty good. Everything is sooooo sweet in this movie that if you don't cry your some kind of insensitive jerk. At least that's what the score makes you feel like. With more fluff than your dryer's lint screen and more intended tear jerking scenes than your average Lindsay Wagner TV movie special, this film dilutes Sandler's humor. Many people who have commented on ""Big Daddy"" to this point say that it is the best Sandler film while ""Happy Gilmour"" and ""Billy Madison"" were just plain stupid. Look, Gilmour and Madison weren't supposed to be nice comedies for nice people. I enjoyed those two films infinitely more than Big Daddy, so maybe I'm void of feeling or something. Moreover, if those aforementioned Sandler films are ""dumb"" this one is just plain offensive. The court room scene is THE dumbest, most unrealistic, downright awful court scene ever. If you've seen it you know what I mean. I was able to stomach the film until then, I remember saying to myself ""maybe they're trying to make a commentary on the sad state of affairs for foster children,"" but nope - not even close. The only way to describe the courtroom proceedings is surreal. If Dali had been a filmmaker he couldn't have outdone the downright absurd quality of it. This movie sucked, and if you thought so too you must also be an insensitive jerk. The ""touching"" parts of the film were SAPPY and PHONY, Jon Stewart should be banned from acting in feature length motion pictures (as much as I like him on the small screen). He always picks dumb roles for himself - in his touching scene at the end of ""Big Daddy"" its painfully obvious just how bad he is conveying emotion. I guess I just can't say enough bad things about this movie, so I'll add that Joey Lauren Adams (who is sexy and intriguing in all other films I've seen her in) is dumpy and wasted on this Sandler vehicle. When she cries (endlessly) throughout it makes you wish she'd just go away and leave us (the audience) alone. All in all I hated this movie and would recommend it to all nincompoops who like to snivel and blow their nose during boring, boorish, idiotic, falsely emotional films...",1,2000
"This is a completely different take on any 'coming out' movie I have ever seen - but with RuPaul as a former homosexual turned 'conversion therapist,' it would pretty much have to be!",8,2000
"Incredible social commentary. Yes, It's a little campy, but it's all supposed to be that way. It's an amusing look at attempting to 'rehab"" homosexuals with therapy and ""finding their roots"". Great acting all around, excellent writing. ",8,2005
"I was fortunate enough to catch ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" last night, and I must say the only thing that bothered me was the fact that I hadn't stumbled upon it sooner.",8,2005
"To many viewers this is probably not much more than a well-made, feel-good satirical comedy about teenage homosexuality and adult homophobia mixed with some heart-warming moments, and indeed it serves that function of somewhat superficial entertainment well. But it is a lot more than that. If you watch carefully, this is an incredibly honest, revealing and touchingly sensitive film on teenage identity crisis and identity search interacting with social influences. It tells you more than any psychology book could tell on adolescence, because one cannot put all that into words. Natasha Lyonne as 17 year old Megan (the heroine of the story) demonstrates amazing qualities of acting in a role which is probably the most demanding any actor or actress can face: that of a changing adolescent personality re-discovering one's inner, formerly suppressed unconscious self over two months, while still remaining herself in a way. If you compare her different faces at different phases of the story, e.g. when she ""just cannot think of anything"" at the camp, and when she looks into the bathroom mirror much later in the film washing her teeth, you will see what I mean. If you are not distracted by hilariously funny bits and jokes and you do not consider poor acting by Cathy Moriarty, it is in fact a top quality drama made superbly. Intimate conversations between the two leading actors (Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall) tell more in one minute of this film about life than most movie star celebrities do throughout their whole career. Natasha Lyonne should have received an Oscar for this as best actress, and she should have been offered leading roles in less superficial films than ""American Pie"". A talent wasted. Her performance in this film is an extraordinary achievement and a very touching experience for anyone sensitive enough to resonate to it. I highly recommend it for re-watching it several times: you will not get bored if you are attentive enough.",9,2009
"My gay best friend and I watched this movie together recently.  I found it to be quite a funny and touching film.  It played on all the typical gay stereotypes, while also discrediting them. I found it to be highly enjoyable.  There were some genuinely comic moments to be found here. Everyone (gay, straight, bi, or whatever) can get a pleasant laugh out of this movie. Don't miss out on it just because of its controversial subject matter. A+",10,2000
"well instead of being philosophical and talk about the obvious political messages of this great film, i'll just review it.",10,2000
But I'm A Cheerleader was a great look at what Hollywood rarely looks at. Gays. It was a beautiful and funny movie with a great cast. Jamie Babbit Directed her young cast brilliantly and the cast should be commended on the believability of their characters. Each actor and actress really becomes the role. Admititly it is not without its drawbacks. Some of the scenes went to fast and we were not able to soak in the jokes. In some scenes the actors who payed the gay men did over act their roles a bit but i suppose they had to. Really needs two viewings to appreciate it more. Also anyone who does not get moved by 'that cheer' must be made of stone. A great movie for anyone in the closet or anyone just looking for a good feel-good-movie.,10,2008
"For anyone who grew up or is growing up gay in middle-America or just about all of America, get ready to return to the most twisted version of your high school years and laugh till you're pink in the face.  But, I'm a Cheerleader is one of the best gay themed movies to date.  It is certainly one of the best comedies.  Sort of a Jeffrey turned female high school cheerleader meets John Waters with only the best qualities of each.",9,2001
"Very rarely am I this impressed by a film.  As a matter of fact, I have seen it three times in the theatres and will gladly go again if I have the chance.  People were literally laughing out loud in the theatre in a way I haven't heard since seeing Waiting For Guffman.  This movie is the perfect blend of campy satire and tender love story.  It is not trying to change the world, but it will manage to change your heart.  Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall are incredible, but it's not just the cute girls that makes this film worth seeing.  On a film making level, this movie is inventive and original. The soundtrack blends seamlessly with the story line.  The people who picked the music for this film could not have done a finer job.",10,2000
"Natasha Lyonne plays Megan, a sweet, all-American, Christian cheerleader in this hysterical satire about teenagers who are forced to go to a gay rehabilitation camp, 'True Directions', to stop their homosexual urges. What forces Megan to attend this camp?  Well, she's a vegetarian, she hates kissing her boyfriend, and she has a poster of Melissa Etheridge in her room.  Oh No!  A gay intervention headed by RuPaul as his original male self is just the beginning of a programme to de-homosexualize Megan.",8,1999
"Someday, gay cinema will grow up.  In the meantime gay women and men are so hungry for representation, so starved to see themselves on the silver screen, that even junk like this is welcomed.",2,2003
"Okay little comedy... has its heart in the right place... but it doesn't quite work. Interesting premise of a good teenage Catholic girl who gets sent to a re-programming camp because her parents and friends think she is a... gasp... lesbian! Of course, the camp itself is run by a bunch of extreme closet-cases (Cathy Moriarty, RuPaul Charles), the most normal people in the film are the gay and lesbian people who refuse to give in the pressure and be who they want to be. A nice lesson and all... and the movie is certainly better than your average teen comedy... but, while gently amusing, it doesn't bust out into a full-blown comic triumph. Natasha Lyonne does nice work as the oblivious teen who comes to accept her sexuality even as everyone around her is trying to subvert it. Her romance with a fellow camp mate threatens both their chances at ""graduation""... when it comes down to it will they both do the right thing and follow their hearts? Oh, I can't spoil it for ya...",4,2004
"This almost-inept, often heavy-handed, little ""queer"" Comedy from 1999 was basically nothing but a contrived, one-note joke that got real tiresome, real fast. I'd say that But, I'm a Cheerleader (BIAC, for short) could've probably been a somewhat amusing little film had the script not been such a inane mess right from the start.",3,2015
"As a bi-female, who came to terms with this in the south, sometimes it is hard to find something that makes you sit back and say ""Yes, I understand"". This movie is hilarious in a John Waters style, but at the same time it can reach so many gay and lesbian teens to help them know they are not alone. I laughed throughout it, and have proceeded to tell everyone about it. I highly recommend it to anyone: gay, straight or indifferent.   Check it out!",9,2001
"Talk about a missed opportunity, ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is one of the biggest of the last few years. The send-up is perfect; a high-school cheerleader is obviously a lesbian. It's obvious to everyone around her (family, boyfriend, fellow classmates), but not to her; she's clueless. How can she be a lesbian? She is, as the title states, a cheerleader, and they're not lesbians. Family and friends conduct an intervention and send the hapless young lady to a coed gay-deprogramming camp. So far so good, the stage is set for some hard-punching satire. Unfortunately the director and screenwriters are not up to it. Instead they opt for ""Police Academy"" level potty humor, tired offensive stereotypes, terrible scripting, lousy directing..you name it, and it stinks. The film self-destructs after the first 20 minutes, and becomes an insulting waste of time.  Too bad.",3,2001
"Young Natasha Lyonne's parents, Bud Cort and Mink Stole, have noticed a disturbing tendency in their daughter. She has not been developing an interest in the opposite sex as a 'normal' teenage girl should even if she is a cheerleader, the most heterosexual of activities you would think. ",8,2007
Okay this movie is about how nice and sweet it is to be a gay female. And okay I can dig that. But what made me mad about this movie is what they made the gay males look like. The famles seemed normal while the males seemed very stupid. All the males were there for is a nice laugh.,3,2003
"This seemed like it was intended for John Waters to direct and then he saw the script and passed but they kept his casting choices.  Mink Stole is in the movie so I guess John is represented indirectly, plus the color scheme and wardrobe would have gotten his approval. ",2,2001
"This movie is wonderful. It blends classic camp with a beautifully touching love story. That may seem like an odd combination, but Jamie Babbit (Malcolm in the Middle, among others) delivers a wry comedy about sexual stereotypes, while surreptously getting you to deeply sympathize with a pair of outcast teenage lesbians.",9,2003
"****CONTAINS SPOILERS***** ****CONTAINS SPOILERS***** This is a wonderful movie. Not only is the plot cute and funny, but the acting is superb. About a supposedly straight cheerleader (Natasha Lyonne) being sent to a ""straight camp"", a sort of program to turn her straight, when her parents suspect her of being a lesbian. The camp only makes her realize her homosexuality and find love in a peer (Clea Duvall. The chemistry portrayed between these two is great, the dialogue is great, and just the way these actors portray their characters is hilarious. The sweet ending puts a nice lift on it. You should see it if you want to be cheered up.",10,2003
"I loved this show. I lived to watch this show every week. It had action, compassion, love, hate, thrills, you name it. Why was this show taken off the air? My god. They leave the soap operas on for years and years and then you get a wonderful show like this and they take it off. I don't understand. There was never a dull moment on this show. Always something going on. I sure wish they would start it up again. It would be sooooo great. I always wanted Bosco to hook up with Faith. Now that would have been so great. They had a chemistry going. That let me down when they did not at least kiss. You know they wanted to...haha Sad in Louisiana, Linda",10,2006
"Watching THIRD WATCH is like reading a good book I just can't put down. I'm not one to ""get hooked"" on programs, like soaps, but THIRD WATCH got me good! I only wish I'd seen the original airings. I don't want to miss a single episode of this action packed series. The viewer is drawn in to the actors' characters causes and effects. The lives of the characters are deeply affected by their jobs as fire fighters, police person, or paramedics. The cast are excellent actors and perfect choices for their characters. It's difficult to pick a favorite character as all the interactions and relationships are just perfect. I can't say enough good about this drama, except it's terrible it was canceled after the 6th season. However, give everyone involved with the program credit for putting an ending to the series. Knowing the ending doesn't made a difference with wanting to watch the previous episodes.",10,2006
"After having seen the first episode I was hooked on the show, (love at first sight). The blend of cops, firefighters and paramedics, and all the human aspects of life, like: loyalty, friendship, e.c.t. made this series # 1 on my list. Well, I have to say, there are not many series that can keep me interested season after season, but THIRD WATCH was/is one of them, it's only getting better and better.",8,2004
"I do not usually watch TV shows which are longer than a couple of episodes as I hate to be tied up but this one really got me stuck. Here in Malta I watch it on Italian TV, two episodes which start at 2.30am and end at 4.30am and still it is all worth it. Forget Lost and Prison Break which have promising starts but then end up boring you to death, Third Watch is a real masterpiece and the characters really get you involved especially Boscorelli and Yokas. This show also gives a touch of reality of what its like to be a police officer in NY and the toll this job can have on one's private life. Well done to all those involved in this masterpiece of a show.",10,2008
"One of my favorite series of all time. Too bad it was cancelled, i feltit had some more seasons left. The cheap shows etc stay... I have watched the series in full at least 2 times. Worth it! It felt realistic in every way and it brought up actual real life problems. The characters had depth and you got to see them in a work environment as in the private life of the people. It shows the hardships police, firefighters and paramedics have to deal with but also everything good that comes with it. I felt the ending was very sudden and much more was to be told about the lives of those people fighting for all of us day in and day out. It might be a fictionall show with fictional characters but according my dad who was a police officer it was very good and realistic. Bring it back or something similar.",9,2017

"What an absolutely amazing show!!! I followed it religiously! Great, creative writers, talented actors, amazing consistency, great medical accuracy combined with amazing attention to detail made Third Watch unique. Captivating story lines mixing the absolute extreme with normal everyday issues. Realistic, multidimensional, diverse characters from various age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds showing the different complex relationships they had with one another and how they And the relationships changed over time. I love the raw human emotions this show evoked. The humour injected was intelligent. I loved how the story lines tied together. I was so disappointed when this show came off the air. Glad to know there is still a large fan base. I still think I must be one of the shows biggest fans!",10,2009
I'm not sure which show the other posts are referring to. Certainly not the Third Watch I saw.,2,2006
"I guess the people who don't watch the usual soap operas and talk shows watch this to make them feel better about themselves. While before mentioned get off on moral issues, this one deals with criminals, with the actual law, let's get back to this one a bit later... Here there seem to be no innocent victims. Just the iron fist of justice. I guess the appeal here is we have no classy lawyers to justify their actions. Get the scumbag, arrest and question him, possibly with some of the usual police methods. And most of them seem pretty justified. Maybe until some lawyer gets the case and makes the closing speech...something like: well this guy did all this and that, but do his actions justify all the police brutality? NO! This guy was a victim. And therefore you should not find him as guilty. Well the thing here is: we don't see any of this things. All in all this pretty much sums up what's the deal with these soap police series. Here we have some non plus ultra representatives of the law catching bad guys (some of them have gone over the edge, but hey! what the hell, they are dealing with some disturbed individuals!) putting them behind bars and making look themselves as the contributing individuals to society. Maybe my strongest argument would be: What if we would put the cases from Third Watch into the hand of some lawyers from the Practice. Maybe even what if we would put the cops themselves into the hands of some fancy lawyers. Maybe I got a little off the way, if you are still keeping up... here is the real message of this show: The people who take care of the bad guys are the greatest heroes of them all, it doesn't matter if they are just fighting against the consequences of the regime that is the cause of all these things. On the side note, the whole acting, directing. sometimes it just makes me laugh. But that is the least of the problems of this charade.",2,2006
"I wonder what kind of disease Cruz has. Obviously she knows what she has because of the way she acted when the doctor wanted to talk with her. Now, this could be one of the reasons why Cruz isn't the friendliest to everybody. The only thing I can think of how she could get a disease in the show is when she was raped by that guy when she was pretending to be a nurse. Now, I don't care what every girl thats going through puberty says about Boscoe leaving and they are not going to watch the show. Cry me a river even if Boscoe wasn't in the show and they had a different person playing the role of Boscoe the show would be good. This season has been the best by far and I only wish they could put the show on DVD. Everybody leaves a show eventually Frasier, Friends, Seinfeld,etc... What makes Third Watch great is that you can actually sympathize with the characters and whats going on.",10,2005
"If ur reading these comments like I did before watching the show pay attention... WATCH IT!!! My friend has the shows on tape and I am finishing the entire show over the last several months and I gotta say it an incredible show. My feelings are the only way u make that many episodes (120+) is with high quality writing and characters u really end up caring about. I dare anyone to watch this show and not fall in love with Bosco played by Jason Wiles. Loved Faith, his partner, and Cruz who plays a great renegade character who u can't decide if u respect or hate with each episode!! I personally LOVE shows with story arcs and underlying story lines that last half a season to multiple seasons.",9,2008
"This is my favorite television show to watch, even though it ended its run over a year ago. I never watched the show during its run, and came across it one night when I couldn't sleep. After watching a few episodes over a few consecutive nights, I found myself liking the show and the characters, and began watching and taping the show on a regular basis. The characters are great. You really find yourself caring about them, and hated to see them hurt. The most endearing characters to me were Monte 'Doc' Parker, Faith Yokas, Ty Davis Jr., Bobby Caffey, Maurice 'Bosco' Boscorelli, Jimmy Doherty, and Kim Zambrano. The actors on the show are all exceptional as well. Coby Bell is my favorite actor from the show and is very underrated. He's an incredible actor. Molly Price is also extraordinarily talented, and yet she's not a household name. She's great. Michael Beach also, as Doc, was really good. The rest of the cast, also, was just impeccable. The writing on the show was some of the best I've seen on TV. The story lines were compelling and completely sucked you in for sixty minutes each episode. Then, you're left waiting on the edge of your seat for the next episode. The show had a devoted following, but was inexplicably cancelled by NBC in March of 2005. With the NBC network really struggling right now, they should really be kicking themselves for cancelling such a great show. I guess 132 episodes on A&E will have to be enough.",10,2006
"'Third Watch' is a drama series about a group of cops, fire fighters and paramedics. They do what real cops/firemen/paramedics usually do, and that way they create the best drama tv series ever - in my opinion. What i love the most about this show is the fact that it's unpredictable. You never know what's gonna happen next, i found myself shocked many many times by the events taking place in the show. The producers always manage to suprise and shock us. For example, one of the main characters is absolutely fine, has some minor issues, but who doesn't ? And then all of a sudden in the next episode he goes crazy and does something absolutely unexpected and shocking. It happens all the time in 'Third Watch'.Speaking of characters - they're all very well written, and the cast is very talented. This is basically all i have to say about this show, it love it, if you haven't seen it before, give it a shot, you'll love it too :)",10,2004
"I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one darn good movie.",8,2000

"Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don't think so.",8,2000
"Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there.  I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown.  I really can't think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don't know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown.  A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand.  You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don't feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives.  Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen.",10,1999

This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form may be the most overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? The spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid.

"Is there?  Because if there is, I want to see it.  I went to see this movie because all my friends told me that it would scare me.  I've never been even remotely frightened by a movie before.  This movie didn't even come close to scaring me.  It was so unbelievably asinine and stupid that I can't believe it even got picked up for distribution, much less called ""great"".  I can't believe it made the amount of money it did.  I should have demanded a refund.  Let's put it this way -- if I took a few of my friends into the woods, with a video camera, and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream, it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie.  I'm sorry, but those ""blair witch"" noises sounded exactly like someone playing a prank on them.  A waste of my $7.",1,2001
"The Blair Witch Project has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was not scary.  It was not intriguing.  It was boring, and the jerky camera work left me nauseated.  The acting was decent, but the storyline didn't really go anywhere and the cinematography was atrocious.  I understand they were supposed to be film 'students,' but my 10-year-old sister can shoot better footage than this.  At the end I was really wondering why I bothered to sit through the whole thing, and I was definitely sorry that I actually paid to see it in a theater.

I saw this thing three times, and while it's got a great idea, and it's not terrible for a student film say, it's far far too long and boring for the one trick it's got to pull, I simply am at a loss as to how so many people can allegedly have loved this thing.",1,2001
"If you thought that ""Star Wars Episode 1"" was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), ""Blair Witch"" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, ""Blair Witch"" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.",1,1999
"I watched the Blair Witch Project with a dozen other people, who also heard all the hype about this new horror flick and we were anticipating the big ""scary"" moment(s) to come.  Guess what? It never came.  Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make).  One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary.  The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment.  Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the ""Project"" that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project",1,1999
Some observations:,1,2001
"1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.",1,2013

The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.",8,2005
"It seems that many people dislike this movie and I can see why. First of all it shows that professional athletes are far away from being perfect. A lot farther than we would like to believe. The movie shows that many athletes as we know are just out their for the money. It also shows the corruption in the owners and politicians. But for me, all of this is good thing. I like seeing a movie that does not include glory in sports.",10,2007
"Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives the viewer a glimpse into an athletic world not too far from the real thing. While some of the scenes were a little too over the top, it proved to be a very enjoyable experience. As a major football fan, I was disappointed in the fact the NFL did not allow Stone to use their logos and stadiums. Oh well, I seemed to enjoy the fictional league even better, even if some of the team uniforms were a dreadful. Jamie Fox portrayed Willie Beamon perfectly, epitomizing the selfish athlete with a cultured ease. While the speed of Beamon's rise proved to be a little too quick, the message in the rise and fall of stardom was more poignant than anything.",7,2002
"The positives in the movie was a good cast. I don't like Cameron Diaz in most roles, but this was her best one by far. She is very good as a woman owner of a football team trying very hard to do it as a woman. In addition, at times the football action was entertaining. It is the ""off-field"" dramas that mar the film substantially.",5,2007
"Oliver Stone is one of the most, if not THE most, passionate filmmakers working today.  He's also a talented filmmaker, which a lot of people seem to forget.  When both his talent and passion are at full strength, the results are impressive(SALVADOR, PLATOON, JFK, NIXON).  When the passion is still there, but the talent is tripped up by his passion and ambitions, he makes flawed movies which are still powerful(WALL STREET, TALK RADIO, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, HEAVEN AND EARTH).  But when he goes outside of his passions, for either experiments(NATURAL BORN KILLERS), or to make ""mainstream"" movies(U-TURN), he misses wide.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS, to me, was a worse film, but U-TURN was, in a way, even more dispiriting, because the former you could at least excuse as an experiment gone wrong, whereas the latter screamed ""Cash-in!""  You felt after watching Stone was too tired to fight anymore.",8,2000
"Sports movies are tough to make.  Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest.  Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception.  It is hard-hitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY.  It is actually conventional when you think about it, like a warped RUDY.  It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself.  This is why I liked it.",7,2000
"Any Given Sunday is one of Oliver Stone's most enjoyable movies. Sunday is pure entertainment, an action-packed spectacle that will delight even the most ardent sports enthusiast. Stone draws on the usual assortment of sports movie clichés, but he directs his actors, including Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, and LL Cool J, into such passionate and intense performances, that the movie is able to transcend its familiar material. While its 160-minute running time is a bit of a detriment, AGS works overall as a superior piece of escapist entertainment. Also, the locker room scene, which showcases a confrontation between Cameron Diaz and a football player with a giant penis, is a classic.",6,2006
"I thought what a great combo for ""Any Given Sunday"" - Oliver Stone and professional football -- excess meets its match. ",7,2005
Any Given Sunday (1999),8,2006
"That this movie is pretentious, nonfactual, overdone and riddled with tired sports clichés shouldn't surprise anyone, especially those that know it's yet another of Oliver Stone's fantasies purporting to be otherwise. What's astonishing is how little the executive producer-screenwriter-director knows about football; there were so many errors (e.g. in the movie, each touchdown adds 7 points instantaneously, the second a player crosses the goal line!). In fact, it's almost unwatchable and many will feel cheated out of (nearly) 3 hours of their life. Since the story lines are entirely predictable, Stone and his editors present it with unrelenting quick cuts and assault their audience with a soundtrack that's mostly too loud, yet too soft at other times (perhaps to keep 'us' from hearing more of the inane dialog?). The movie contains too many unrealistically silly scenes to mention them all, but these stood out: when Diaz's character is confronted with full-frontal male nudity and ""the eyeball"".",1,2010
"Let me start by saying that i dont like or even understand american football and i personally think it does not come close to soccer but with this film it did not matter a jot. Oliver Stone had directed a film here that crosses all bounderies. You dont have to like the sport or understand it to appreciate how brilliant this film is. It is shot so well ,it makes you fell you are in the game and as for the soundtrack well that just adds to a mesmerising showpiece. Stars such as Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid,James Woods and Cameron Diaz star but for me the real Star of this film is James Foxx who plays the Quaterback who begins to believe his own hype but ultimately understands that it the team that matters. One of the test of a good film is that if you start to look at the clock throughout the film is usually means its not good , this film lasted 2 and a half hours and i never looked at the time. Brilliant. 9 out of 10.",9,2001
"I just got back from ""AGS"".  After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life.  Great cinematography ? Give me a break.  The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups.  Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?",1,1999
"Maybe it's just me, but when I hear about an Oliver Stone directed football movie starring none other than Al Pacino I'm expecting a masterpiece. That's why I was quite taken aback by how much of a turd Any Given Sunday is. It's the story of fictional NFL team the Miami Sharks. Al Pacino is the team's head coach who is trying to desperately to take them to the playoffs, but to do so he must battle against unnecessary roughness on and off the field. Dennis Quaid plays the teams star quarterback who, after a nasty hit, is put out of the game and replaced by Jamie Foxx who somehow becomes a superstar after winning just two games, because that's how the NFL works, right? Turmoil continually befalls the team as they try to keep it together so they can go all the way and have the season of a lifetime.",3,2011
"Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means.  They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever.  This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur.  If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs?   He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons.  It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.",1,1999
"I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. The acting was over the top. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl. But, he is a tad more athletic than the aged Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with ADD. That is why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and numerous edits. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino for doing this crap. Cameron Diaz? Heck, that no-talent takes any role that comes down the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best ""actor"" you got going, well, your movie sucks! And this one does.",1,2007
"First of all, I didn't want to see it because, after all, it's a football movie, but I was bored and my roommates wanted to go, so I succumbed to peer pressure.  Biggest mistake of my life.  Secondly, there were way too many minor stories about almost every player on the team that you don't know who to route for.  By the end of the three hours, I was routing for the other team just because I knew the season would end and, hopefully, the movie would be over.  I wouldn't see this movie again if Leonard Maltin told me it was his pick of the year.",1,1999
"I am a fan of Oliver Stone. He made many films that are classics in my eyes. Consider films like Platoon, JFK, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, or Natural Born Killers. Even W. Now we see a certain Oliver Stone as director of Any Given Sunday. This can not be the same Oliver Stone. Obviously Any Given Sunday is made by a Gangster Rapper, a wannabe with some experience doing MTV videos, commercial videos and some experience doing promotion videos for American Football. Is this film so bad? In my opinion? Definitely! The first part of the film was just terrible, the second part at least had some structure and some story. Apart from the very poor directing, the editing was amazing as well. Lots of random shots, lots of meaningless shots, lots of unrelated shots. Add to that a sometimes weird soundtrack.",3,2014
"You want a top notch football movie??, look no further then this one, it's wonderfully acted, with exciting football action!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is excellent, plus Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz are simply amazing in this!, and Jamie Fox is fantastic!. It's loud, trashy, violent and in your face, and you know what I absolutely loved it! plus Al Pacino's speech near the end was truly moving!. Jamie Fox and Al Pacino had some very powerful scenes together, and being a huge Football fan, I was highly pleased with this film, plus it even has a cameo from that idiot Terrell Owens!. Oliver Stone put out another fantastic film here in my opinion, and never in my life have I seen, such violent football! plus it's extremely well made and written as well. I saw the Directors cut version, and I can't see why so many people dislike it, sure it's a little over long, but never is it boring! plus I loved how it wasn't afraid to go over the line either!. You want a top notch football movie??, look no further then this one, it's wonderfully acted,with exciting football action, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Oliver Stone does a fantastic! job here, with excellent camera work, outstanding angles, great slow mo shots, cool POV shots and plenty of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Al Pacino is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, very intense, delivered some great lines as always, was fascinating to watch, was really into his role, carried the film at times, and had some wonderful scenes with both Fox and Diaz,he was amazing. (Pacino Rules!!!!!!!). Cameron Diaz is stunningly gorgeous and actually does an amazing job here, she goes toe to toe with Pacino in heated arguments, which is pretty damn impressive if you ask me, this proves she really can act when she wants too, I loved her performance. Jamie Foxx is surprisingly fantastic here, and uses his cockiness to his advantage, he is very unlikable at the start, but turns out to be not a bad guy after all,, he gave a fantastic performance. Dennis Quaid is really good here as the QB Jack Rooney, I dug his character, and he was quite likable. James Woods is OK here but didn't have much to do as the Doc and was kind of wasted. LL Cool J is pretty good here, and as I said before I think he is a good actor. Lawrence Taylor is actually good here too!, I was really surprised. Jim Brown is OK in his small role, and did what he had to adequately, he is one of the best RB's of all time though!. Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers),Bill Bellamy(Jimmy Sanderson),Andrew Bryniarski(""Madman Kelly""),Lauren Holly(Cindy Rooney),Ann-Margret(Margaret Pagniacci),Elizabeth Berkley(Mandy Murphy),Charlton Heston(Commisoner.),John C. McGinley(Jack Rose),James Karen(Ed Phillips),all do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it now!. ***** out of 5 (barely)",10,2006
"The beauty of this film lies in its almost abstract presentation, and for some strange reason ANY GIVEN Sunday is possibly my favourite film ever.",10,2005
"The film was wonderful. Excellent acting by Pacino and Foxx. I've come to the conclusion that if Pacino is listed in the credits, the movie is going to be awesome. Jamie Foxx has made his mark and hopefully we'll see him in many movies to follow. The movie made you feel as if you were on the field with the players, absorbing the hits and living the highs and lows off the field. Totally real and as a woman, I appreciated the full frontal made nudity. We've all seen Hollywood project enough female nudity on the screen, and the locker-room scene was part of the story. THANK YOU!!! And Bravo to all the actors/actresses.",10,1999
"this movie was a story of blood guts and a way to see football the way it is really run.  the actors were great. al pacino was amazing and should get some kind of recognition for this, possible academy calling?  the blend of camera work and the football scenes were great.  oliver stone has swallowed that frog in his throat that has been stuck the past 10 years.  a movie of christmas season to remember and will be remembered for even more.",10,1999
"Being a long-time resident of south Florida, I found the story of this most excellent movie familiar.  Stone surely must have based the QB (Randy Quaid in one of his best roles ever)on the aging Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins. Whatever his inspiration, Mr. Stone has done a wonderful job (again). This exposé of Football, as it were, is craftily and beautifully executed.",10,1999
This was one of the best movies I've seen in long time and I don't even like football. It was just plain good.  Jamie Fox did a tremendous acting job as did Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz.  It ends with a twist and just kind of leaves you in awe. The camera work was awesome too along with the great music played in the movie.  You've gotta see it!,10,1999
I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.,10,1999
"All too often, ""family films"" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like ""The Iron Giant"", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.",10,1999
"After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: ",9,2004
"What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!",10,1999
"Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.",10,2000
"Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.",10,1999
"I had heard many great things about the iron giant in the last few years but was one of those films I never got round to seeing. I picked up a copy of the special edition DVD expecting an entertaining animated film. What I actually got was not just one of the best animated films I have seen but one of the best films ever. It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed. Brad Bird must be one of the best directors working in animation and after seeing the incredibles the iron giant was no fluke.",10,2006
"""The Iron Giant"" is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. Brad Bird, the talented man that worked in shows like ""The Simpsons"" and directed the great animated film ""The Incredibles"" is the man responsible for this masterpiece. That man is a genius who is able to turn the simplest stories into gold, having an entire career of very good films. Even his ""Mission Impossible"" film (A franchise which I particularly don't like)managed to be worth-watching.",10,2007
"Like most reviewers here, I stumbled across The Iron Giant. Frankly, I don't know how I missed it in the theatres, but I picked up a used VHS copy a few years back and fell for it. I recently purchased the DVD version and have rekindled my appreciation for this lovely film.",10,2005
"Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.",10,2009
Belated review written in 2017.,10,2017
"Without a doubt this is my favorite animated movie of all time. I have seen it dozens of times and I still enjoy watching it once or twice a year. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just for kids. The animation, editing and soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but I cannot think of a Disney movie that can touch the Iron Giant on any level. This movie can be enjoyed by kids, parents and non-parents alike. It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open). This is the type of movie I wish Hollywood would do more of, instead of re-makes and movies based of TV shows.",10,2010
"The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10,2009
"What an amazing film. I had no idea what a wonderful film this is. I mean, I'm in my mid 30's and a mum of 3. I absolutely love this film. My kids really enjoy it but I don't think they really appreciate the message that it is trying to put across. (well, my 4 year old anyway) My 7 year old just likes it for the bang factor. (the explosions and stuff!) ",9,2006
"This certainly ranks as one of the finest examples of cinema in recent pop culture memory. Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. ",10,2009
"I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one personone person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.",8,2007
"I consider myself a fairly hard-headed and cynical guy.  I like my movies to have blood and death.  As a rule, I want to see explosions and terrible slaughter.  I loath sentimental slop.  So, when I sat down to watch Iron Giant, I was not expecting much more than a Disney-esque piece of emotional goo.  I'd also read the original book, and I was prepared to be annoyed by departures from the 'Iron Man'.",9,2003
"WB certainly took some risks here.  An animated flick with no musical numbers, no cute little animal sidekicks, blood, and a couple ""damn""s, ""hell""s and even a ""screw""?  Overall, I think it worked fairly well.  Nice animation, retro-design characters, simple but sophisticated plot, and just the right touch of visual humor, e.g. the robot mimicking the child's postures, the detached hand running amok through the house, etc.  Ignore the preachy anti-gun message (which was, by the way, lost on the younger kids in the audience - my four year old thought the iron giant was cool because ""he had all those guns that could blow up tanks""), and you have yourself one very entertaining movie.  Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. ""gun's can be good if used defensively"", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic -  a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.",7,1999
"No matter what anyone says, It wasn't me blubbering at the end of this movie.  I had something in my eye, was all.  Anyone who testifies differently is a filthy liar.  I thought the movie was okay, you know, if you're like a kid or something, but it didn't touch me at all... *sniff* I have to go now...",10,2000
I have seen many animated movies in my life from Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman:Mask of the Phantasm to Snow White and the Lion King. The Iron Giant is the best by far not just technically with amazingly beautiful visuals but overall. This movie appeals to people of all ages like no other movie before if you have not seen it go see it. ,10,2006
"I had heard from other people that Farscape was good, so when I had the opportunity to watch the two final episodes in the whole series, I took it, and I haven't regret it since. I only regret, that I took me so long to discover the BEST SCI-FI Series on EARTH. (It will be difficult to beat this one). By watching these episodes, it made me want to know what had happen prior to the final, how it all had started, I just wanted more of the same.",10,2005
"I am a die hard science fiction fan. I mean really, i read it i watch it i even listen to the theme songs. The Farscape series and the finishing mini series is the absolutely best science fiction show i have ever seen. The show only aired very shortly on cable TV here in Denmark, so i bought all of the episodes on DVD.",9,2007
Thanks to Sci-fi and the Henson Company for this wonderful contribution to the TV science fiction canon.,9,2007
"I personally believe that Farscape was the finest Sci-Fi show ever put out on television ever. I hardly ever watch the beastly box, but this show was both fantastically written and visually in a league of it's own. The aliens were really alien, not just your man with a Cornish pasty on his head of the week kind of alien. The characters were excellently realised and in almost all cases excellently delivered... ... I highly advise watching it... .... .... .... ....... ........... ........ ....... ... ..... ..... ....... .... ......... ...... ..... I don't have any more to say, stop wasting your time reading this thing and go and watch Farscape already... The story really builds....",10,2007
"Thanks to the BBC I was introduced to this extremely wonderful and epic show! This show had everything, humor,action,thrills,great characters and the best drama! Now you may think I am not being objective,but when it comes to movies and TV shows I can be very critical! For me an excellent series is a show I can watch over and over again without getting bored! Let me tell you,there are not many shows who are able to do that! Farscape manages to do so with ease. I think there are many reasons why this show is great! 1). The combination of CGI and Jim Henson's Creature shop muppetry give the show a look never seen before. ",10,2006
"FarScape is PERFECT!!! Go and watch it on TV, buy a DVD, I don't care, just watch this magnificent show! This show has it all- humor, romance, drama, excellent cast. It is funny, crazy, smart, just like life itself. after you watch it go to our at Watchfarscape.com and help save Farscape. Farscape has been closed, but we want it back, we need every scaper out there! this show is better than any other, and I don't mean only any other sci-fi show but EVERY show there is out there, just watch the first episode of FARSCAPE and you will know what I'm talking about! This show is truly amazing, watch, and watch it right now, don't waste time...turn of the computer and Watch it. Scape on!",10,2007
"Excellent , perfectly acted , crazy , creative , dramatic , romantic , funny , thrilling etc. All these terms are combined together to create one of the best science fiction/fantasy productions ever made : Farscape.",10,2007
"After completing disc two of season 3, I just can't contain my excitement any longer. Scifi fans and fans of great television take note, Farscape goes from strength to strength progressively getting bigger, better, glossier and meatier with every passing episode. ",9,2007
"Most episodes of Farscape had a single writing credit, but here's how I think they were really written: Half a dozen geniuses in a room have fun writing a script together to the best of their ability. When they're done, they lock themselves in there for a further week and take it apart line by line, constantly asking, 'How can we do this better? How can we do this different? How can we put an original spin on this?' They do this until it's no longer fun and they hate each other. When they break through that and they're in love again they go back once more and really have fun putting humour and sick stuff in.",10,2009
"I only started to watch this a few months ago as I have read so many good reviews and wanted a new show to watch while so many are put on hold, and I have to say this was well worth all the time I put into watching it.",10,2007
It was unfortunate I didn't get into this show until it was canceled. I have become hooked. I have the complete collection on disc and have been unable to watch anything but. I love both the characters and the actors of Farscape. I wish there were periodic movies continuing the storyline. At least I can watch Bowder and Black on SG1. (also and awesome show.) ,10,2007
"Either you love Farscape or you hate it. I don't think there is anything between. I love it and even after more than 15 years it's still one of my favorite shows for many reasons and I re-watch like every two years. Farscape is absolutely crazy, smart, sexy, funny and heartbreaking. There are no resets with the shows. Characters grow, they change and evolve. Actions have consequences and when you think you have seen everything in the genre Farscape does something new. ",10,2016
"I bought all 4 series on DVD (on a cheap special) because I was intrigued by the character Chiana, which I can fully accept is no reason to get into a long lasting TV series. Unfortunately I had to watch season 2 first because the others were still on LayBy, and I know this was another mistake, but I feel it is important to describe the experience. For the first dozen or so episodes I had a slight ill feeling over having had the series put away for me at the store, because I really did find the shows to be a bit silly. But then a change occurred during the ""Look At The Princess"" trilogy. I got to the end of the first part and realised that I had been watching for 45 minutes with a smile on my face. By the end of part 2 the smile had broadened, and by the end of part 3 I was telling all who would listen about how great the show was. Since then I have watched all 4 seasons in their entirety and have absolutely loved every second of it! So my advice is simply this; please give this show a real chance. If you love it from the first moment, great! But if you are like me and find it rather difficult to get into for the first few episodes (especially if you don't get to see it from season 1), PLEASE KEEP GOING! I promise you it will be worth it in the end! Oh yeah, and Chiana slipped down the list to become my fourth favourite character when all was said and done (behind Scorpius, D'Argo & John). The entire cast was incredible!",10,2006
"'Holby City' used to be rubbish, but with the introduction of Connie, Elliot, Mark, Sam S etc, it has turned into a very respectable series - something I would try and get home to watch. I think it is 'Casualty' that has gone downhill - the story lines never seem to go anywhere anymore and I'm not really that bothered if I miss it for an episode of 'Friends', as I can usually catch up because there is never much going on in an episode. If not, my parents can describe the particular episode in quite a lot of detail in a few short sentences. However, if I missed an episode of 'Holby' I would know about it as the story behind it is so much more complex and richly acted through.",10,2006
"This show demonstrates the depths to which UK TV pre-watershed drama has sunk. With these dull scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, awful dialog, one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to see excellent hospital drama.",3,2006
"I have watched Hollywood movies and television for decades and know all their standard cliches. If I watch the first and last five minutes of a movie, I can tell you nearly everything that happened in between. Not with Holby City. Holby City is hot, so good it seems to almost be alive. All the parts, writing, directing, acting, cinematography fit together so beautifully, that to me they approach art. Just know I would not miss a single episode, and if I could watch only one drama series on TV, Holby City would be my choice. Just wish BBC would sell the episode where the whole cast gives Arthur a spectacular send off. When things weren't going well I would put that episode on to chase away the gloom and remind me of happier and better times. Long live Holby City. Can think of no better introduction to Holby City than watching the still available episodes 62 and 63. Calling Holby City a soap opera is wrong. Soap Operas were created early in the last millennium to keep bored housewives distracted while their husbands went out to work. But the Soap Operas were nearly always written by men and were filled with fantasies of office romance, flirtatious secretaries, promiscuity, and adultery. As suspicious housewives greeted their husbands thinking I know what you did at the office today. I am sure the Soap Operas were responsible for the breakup of more than a few marriages. Holby City is televised drama and could have been written by any of our finest dramatists. Holby City sticks to business and stays away from the salaciousness of the typical Soap Opera. Cheers, to excellent drama and comedy.",10,2017
"This show came before Grey's Anatomy and will likely be on after that show ends. I only saw one episode last night but it's typical British soap fare. There is a Jamaican doctor who is taking care of orphaned baby Leeann until they locate her father. She suspects that he is a drug addict because of the physical symptoms and questions the authority. There are other members in the cast but the show doesn't exhibit anything but average writing, above average acting, and above average sets. I never saw Casualty so I can't tell the difference or the similarities. It was on after EastEnders so I watched it and it was watchable in my opinion but I wouldn't say excellent because I think the show needs to do more work in getting strong characters who will be memorable and writing that creates a sensation. Until then, Holby City will be the sister show of Casualty and while it follows EastEnders, it might get an audience leftover to keep it going. I think the show is good and worth watching.",7,2006
"I like both Casualty and Holby City, though despite their quite short episodic lengths, both do suffer from some problems with pacing- it is a bit slow, and perhaps not very easy to stick your teeth into. However, it is decently acted, I enjoy the performances of Amanda Mealing, Paul Bradley, Robert Powell and Hugh Quarshie, and when he was in it, Tom Chambers as Sam. I will confess that despite Richard Briers being on the show for the Christmas episode, that particular episode was a departure from the usual thing we come to expect from Holby City despite a nice twist on It's A Wonderful Life. The scripts are good, and the story lines are quite intriguing, if perhaps predictable at times. Overall, quite arresting stuff. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8,2009
"Much like the candy that bears it's name, ""Jawbreaker"" is a sweet, infectious dark comedy that wants you to enjoy it for a good, long time. Unfortunately, also like the candy, the film is a little hard to swallow, and it doesn't last as long or come on as strong as it's name would lead you to believe.  But even though you know that much candy is bad for you, you still want to have it.",7,2004
"""Jawbreaker"" has all the predictable, clichéd elements of past teen comedies, but I can't deny the fact that I enjoyed it. I think part of its appeal is that it's a darker comedy, like ""Heathers""--though this movie certainly isn't in the same league. Everybody in the cast gives fine performances. Rose McGowan's is a little over-the-top, but I think it fit the tone of the movie. The running time is about 85 minutes, so it doesn't go on long. There are plenty of funny moments that keep it entertaining. You can argue that the Karen Carpenter joke was too cruel, but that joke alone didn't ruin the film for me. The ending is certainly a cop-out. There could've been a MUCH better pay-off! But despite the fact that ""Jawbreaker"" is undoubtedly a flawed film, it's energetic and fun. There are much worse teen movies out there.",7,2004
"Courtney(Rose Mcgowan),Julie(Rebecca Gayheart),Marcie(Julie Benz) and Liz(Charlotte Ayanna) were the most popular girls at school. But on Liz's 17th birthday, her friends want to surprise her and kidnap her. But that plan goes wrong, when accidently, Liz chokes on the jawbreaker, her friends stuffed in her mouth to keep her from screaming. Everyone is totally shocked, except the cold hearted Courtney, who just doesn't give a crap about anybody but herself. Julie wants to go to the police right away and tell them what happened but Courtney calms her down and tries to cover the crime and make it look like somebody raped Liz. Suddenly, a geeky outcast named Fern Mayo(Judy Greer) who has always admired Liz, finds out what happened to her and is totally devasted. Courtney tells her if she keeps her mouth shut, she will make Fern something she always wanted to be. POPULAR. This was a very entertaining and fun dark comedy. I enjoyed it a lot. Rose Mcgowan is gorgeous and does a great job along with the rest of the cast. I would give Jawbreaker 10/10",8,2003
"Jawbreaker is a copy of a copy. It takes plot points from Heathers, Carrie, and uses some originals of it's own to create itself. It's not a bad film. Actually one of the better teen films I have seen recently. It reminds me of a much more recent film I saw a few months back called Mean Girls. Of course that came five years later. This one has all very beautiful, and perky actresses that flood the screen at one time, much like Mean Girls. But Mean Girls was a film that was much more tame and lit the screen up. This one falls under a dark comedy.",8,2011
"The first time I saw this movie was in TV and I liked it so much i recorded it on tape. And watched it again and again and again and again...till the tape was done.....so i bought it on DVD one year later.... At the beginning i thought it's gonna be just ""another teen movie""... BUT IT'S NOT!",10,2007
"When you watch ""Jawbreaker,"" you can't help but sense echoes of ""Heathers,"" ""Clueless"" and ""The Craft.""  So it is a bit of a derivative teen bopper flick.  But it's not a total rip-off and does stand on its own two feet.",6,2001
Jawbreaker is *no* Heathers.,1,2000
"A group of ultra-hip teenage schoolgirls (from Reagan High!) accidentally kill one of their own in a birthday prank gone awry; they struggle to keep their deed a secret even after a nerdy student discovers the truth. Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic ""Heathers"" knock-off. Holds interest nearly half the way, however the wrap-up is right off the assembly-line. It certainly benefits from a good cast, with the central performances by Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart spot-on, however prominently-billed P.J. Soles, William Katt and Marilyn Manson hardly appear at all. *1/2 from ****",4,2008
"Now, the second word to come to mind was insipid.  I wasn't sure exactly that word meant, but for some reason I thought it fit. So, I came home and looked it up. And now, here is the Webster's New World College Dictionary definition of insipid: ""Insipid - adj. - 1. Without flavor, tasteless. 2. Not exciting or interesting; dull; lifeless. Insipid implies a lack of taste or flavor and is, hence, figuratively applied to anything that is lifeless, dull, etc."" I think I may have found a new favorite word. Insipid describes exactly how I felt about this good for nothing movie. Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, and Rebecca Gayheart play three popular girls in high school. As a birthday prank, they kidnap their other best friend so they can humiliate her in front of the whole school. In doing so, they stuff a very large jawbreaker in her mouth to keep her quiet. She accidently swallows it and dies. When a quiet non-popular girl (Judy Evans Greer) finds out, the popular girls tell her that to buy her silence, they will make her popular. Well one thing leads to another, blah blah blah good triumphs over evil and everyone has a la-di-dah time. Now let me ask you something. I may have gone to a normal high school, but I certainly don't remember hearing about friends kidnapping other friends, gagging them, stuffing them into trunks of cars, and then wanting to humiliate them in front of the school. It just doesn't seem like something friends do to each other for a birthday. Maybe get them drunk. Maybe take them out to dinner. Maybe rent a stripper. But kidnapping isn't something I normally think of. So the premise of the movie was stupid. And then the rest of the movie fell into place. Honestly the only good thing about this movie was seeing what next tight, revealing clothing the girls were going to wear next. The script was horrible, which meant that the actors sounded extremely stupid when having to speak those words. The direction was bad, the music was ok, but only when Rock You Like a Hurricane came on. Oh yeah, and I did like seeing Marilyn Manson dressed up as a regular guy (albeit a strange looking one). So pass on this piece of crap. I'd rather spend an hour and a half sucking on a real jawbreaker and staring at the wall than sit through this again.",3,2002
"A pack of 'mean girls' play a prank on the school's prom queen. They kidnap her and put a jawbreaker gumball in her mouth to keep her quiet, hence the title. One problem: she chokes on the gumball. Now the girls have a dead body on their hands. The movie slides into familiar territory (The Trouble with Harry, Weekend at Bernie's) as the girls try to figure out how to get rid of the body while avoiding suspicion. Cops and other complicating factors begin showing up at the worst possible moment, etc. etc. The comedic complications are mostly well executed, and the usual pangs of conscience and arguments among the conspirators keep things lively.

"Another dark high school dramedy, this follows three teen vixens who accidentally kill their fourth best friend. When the class geek walks in on them they bribe her into complacent silence by making her into one of them. But they create a monster and she becomes the new reigning teen bitch.",10,2005
"Ew.  This movie is horrible.  It's either a bad homage or straight out rip-off of the film ""Heathers"", which is worlds better than this, plus it features Rose McGowen reprising that same role she does in just about every film she's in: heartless bitch that never shows any emotions (the only other character she ever portrays is ditzy girl that never shows any emotions. She has range...).  Plus, as if the lame script, thin satire and horrible acting wasn't enough - you get to see Rose and her real life boyfriend, Marilyn Manson, have sex.  It's charming.",1,2001
"This film is sort of similar to mean girls (well, mean girls would be similar to this), but a lot more daring and darker. The characters make the movie what it is. Rose McGowan does a great job as a evil, manipulating bitch who stops at nothing to live her perfect life. The rest of the cast also did really good. The storyline is over the top, but it makes a great riot. Plus, the film actually has some morale to it, showing the good and bad side to human nature. If you like cult films, watch it. And definitely watch it if you are a fan of anyone in the cast. I rate this 7/10. Rated R for sexuality,language and violence-all involving teens.",7,2008
"This movie totally rocked!! I thought this movie had great punch-lines, great style, great music, and above all an AWESOME cast. Rose McGowan is great in this movie, along with newcomer Judy Greer. Julie Benz and Rebecca Gayheart also are good in this movie. This movie sort of put a twist on the teen sensation, along with an R rating and TONS of sex appeal. Overall, I give this movie ****1/2 of *****",10,2000
"This movie wanted to be ""Heathers"" so badly it could taste it. Unfortunately, without Christian Slater, it fell a bit short of that level. Still, good black comedies are hard to find, and Rose McGowan is nearly strong enough to carry the entire movie. Certainly this is worth a rental.",7,2000
"The people who mad this mess have the nerve to compare it to Heathers, a smart, witty, satire. This movie has none of those elements. I did not crack one smile during the whole movie.  Its sad when the best thing that can be said about a movie is its soundtrack.",2,1999
"This has to be one of the worst acted movies that I've ever seen in my entire life.  The plot is weaker than a wet noodle and the shear ridiculousness of it makes one want to burn the video just on principle of preventing future viewers from suffering.  Other than having some attractive actors struting about this has  absolutely no redeeming value.  It is not even entertaining.  After the first 5 minutes I was constantly saying to myself""why are you watching this @#$%.  To which my only logical reply was that ""It has to get better.  It can't be worse.""  It's sort of a Beverly Hills meets Weekend at Berny's without the comedy.  I didn't laugh at anything that the makers had intended to be funny.  The only thing about the whole film that I found even remotely amusing in an ironic sense is how Hollywood keeps spewing up stuff like this movie while artists with a half way original idea are shunned.  Do not see this movie!!   If you do, make sure it is with a friend that is good at ripping on terrible movies.",1,1999
"I always thought the phrase, ""I laughed until I cried,"" was just an oxymoron. Until it happened to me. I watched Dogma: the funniest movie I have ever seen. The movie seemed designed specifically for my warped sense of humor. It was an incredible mesh of the high-brow and the low-brow.",10,2005
"I have always loved Kevin Smith's style of directing and this film has re-affirmed my belief that he is one of the top directors in the film industry at the moment. Dogma's topic was a very sensitive one and could have been misused but Kevin Smith has dealt with the subject perfectly. Anyone who has critisized Dogma for being offensive has really not understood the film. Dogma is full of excellent moments, not least Alanis Morissette who I thought was fabulous in her small but important role as 'God'. All the performances were excellent and the actors complimented each other superbly. Overall this film has a mixture of everything and its underlying message is one which should reach everyone.",10,2000
"Dogma is one of Kevin Smith's most controversial films, a smartly written comedy that takes jabs against the Catholic Church and religion in general and it is very much a cult classic which my friends from college raved about.",10,2013
"While both funny and frightening, this film is more than just a comedy with gratuitous violence and (bad)-language.  It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma [doctrines/church laws] or any belief that causes us to ""draw a line in the sand,"" condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us).  As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies.  Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so.  One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.",9,2001
"Another vote from a cradle Catholic who was not remotely offended by this movie. Not that some of the negatives mentioned by other posters here aren't true -- yes, a lot of the humor is gross, yes, the F-word is overused, yes, its criticism of organized religion is less stinging that you'd expect (though that in itself is a slightly foolish expectation, given that the writer/director is himself an active member of an organized religion). And yes, if you're not Catholic, much of the movie is a little foggy, under-explained, and not very engaging. That last one I definitely agree with; I seriously doubt whether I'd recommend the film to a non-Catholic at all.",9,2000
"Dogma is firmly rooted in Kevin Smith's View Askew world so fans of his other films will not be disappointed. However, it also expands on the direction he took in Chasing Amy by dealing with subject matter and concepts that are personal and thought provoking. Dogma goes beyond the ""dick and fart jokes"", which are reassuringly present, and gives the viewer something to think about.",8,1999
It is not often that you get to see a group of stars that you like in a funny movie that also makes some interesting points.,8,2007
"I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and after seeing this film I can say that it was everything I hoped it would be, and a little bit more. It's extremely well written and directed. The film has the same great comedy we're used to from Kevin Smith, but he shows that he has another dimension that I don't think many people thought was there.",10,1999
"While held back from being truly stunning by some pacing issues and some minor script awkwardnesses, Dogma is an enjoyable trip from beginning to end.  Smith plays textures like a cardshark - from action sequences to philosophical debates to stoned one-liners to dramatic monologues, the action flows remarkably smoothly for all of the twists that are thrown at it.  I was also extremely impressed by the tasteful execution of the more violent scenes, where the graphic aftermath may be shown, but the action happens off-camera.  One rough point was that a great deal of dialogue came of as expostiory - there was simply such a massive back-story (2000 years of religious history...go fig...) that it seemed at times that the plot had to fight its way through the background information.  One particular shot also irked me - in the Bethany/Metatron scene in the cafe, every time the camera cut back to Bethany, she seemed to be in the exact same pose, and break it in a very similar way.  I wonder if this was intentional, or if it was a continuity issue?  The casting of God was simply inspired - her appearance was actually one of the highlights of the film.  Towards the very end, there were some surprisingly touching moments (of course rendered through Smith's unique style), and the closing scene felt like something right out of a good ol' 80's movie (that's a good thing!).  Issues and all, a truly enjoyable film!",9,1999
"""Dogma"" isn't the kind of comedy that most people will find themselves holding onto their guts during. It's more the second-long ""ha!"" kind of comedy.",6,2008
"This movie is one of the funniest movies of all time.  Kevin Smith puts together a movie that defines 'satire' almost perfectly.  The only flaw that this movie has are how long it is.  Even though the movie is almost two and half hours, it delivers enough philosophy to keep people thinking long after watching it.  ""Was Jesus Christ black?"" and ""Is there someone out in the world that is a direct descendent of Mary and Joseph?"" are very thought provoking.",10,2001
"Watching this film was long overdue. I had heard of Kevin Smith's cult following and had experienced the wonderful ride that Chasing Amy was. To add to that, the concept behind Dogma was pretty darn cool. The cast was big, the canvas huge, and the agenda enormous. But none of it could salvage this sinking vessel. All the king's horses and all the king's men, and so forth.",3,2007
There are about 800 reasons why you probably won't like Kevin Smith's 1999 offering 'Dogma.' It uses abnormally foul language. It's crude. It's irreverent. It's completely wacky and also part of the 'Askewniverse' (where you basically have to watch Smith's other films to fully appreciate all the gags here). It is definitely an acquired taste.,9,2014
"Would you believe that the last living descendant of Jesus Christ is a woman working at an abortion clinic in Illinois? And that she's been sent on a holy mission with two minor characters from Clerks and Mallrats as her guides? Prepare to suspend any and all disbelief as you watch the religious satire Dogma.It is written and directed by Kevin Smith, who also stars in the film along with an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, Bud Cort, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, Jason Lee, George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo, Alanis Morissette, and Jason Mewes.",9,2012
"Isn't it a tad funny that Kevin Smith's best movie, Dogma, is somewhat his least popular movie? Dogma isn't just sex and crap jokes, well...ya it is but it's done in high taste and it comes packed with a philosophically honest and insightful story that delves in religion and belief. Dogma does demand an acquired intellect, and maybe some good virtue, a certain acumen in order to best effectively enjoy it. This movie is boring as ish if it's not thought provoking, but it's definitely not boring as ish; it's ridiculously amusing and completely f'ing hilarious. About all of the jokes are 'thinkers', Dogma's wry, ironic sense of humor. I really love Dogma and it's easily one of my most favorable comedies.",8,2013
"And that really says something as he is really quite picky!  I love how this film totally highlights every single bad thing about the Catholic church without offending anyone, maybe if Monty Python had done the same thing Life of Brian premieres wouldn't of had protesting nuns outside the theatres! I think the infamous Smith has made a fantastic film here with an even better cast who really understood that he was trying to hint at the future of Catholicism (not exactly Buddy Christ, but you get the picture) and point out that we do mourn religion and not celebrate it.  Well worth watching, even if you don't get the religious stuff, Chris Rock, Jay Mewes and Kevin Smith are too funny!  More power to Alan Rickman, he had the whole Sheriff of Nottingham thing going again!",10,2003
"I'm not sure what I find harder to believe- the idea that people actually found this film funny, or the fact that it is considered controversial. This is ""satire"" at the level of the Carry On films- when a film uses a giant ""poo monster"" for supposed comedic effect, you know your time is wasted on it. I watched this expecting to chuckle, instead I came out feeling nauseated and patronised. At least half an hour of the film -AT LEAST- is spent with characters explaining the plot background and details to other characters. Can you say yawn? This is the first Kevin Smith movie I've seen and the man is the biggest overwriter I've had the displeasure of coming across. The characters just cannot shut up! This would be fine if the dialogue was witty or insightful, but instead it's lots and lots of swearing (the word ""f~ck loses it's already minimal impact after the fiftieth time you hear it in one scene), and supposedly deep religious discussions that are immature and sound as if they were written by a twelve year old who just became interested in theology.",1,2003
"Dogma is one of those cultural oddities that surely merit reams of postmodern analysis; some day a clever graduate student will make her name with a Dogma-tic dissertation. Unfortunately, as a piece of entertainment, it is far too creepy to warrant most viewers' attention. The movie continually oozes a bizarre mish-mash of bloodthirsty divine retribution, inanely anti-intellectual pseudo-theology, and conservative values shrouded in flimsy pretension to open-mindedness. It would seem that the film wishes to revive sincere interest in an unadorned, anti-institutional version of ""original"" Christianity. It succeeds only in portraying Christianity as a barbaric, simplistic and primitive appeal to middle American mush. Of course, some may believe this portrayal to be accurate, but that makes it no less disconcerting.",1,2000
"Dogma is a very funny movie and criticizes a lot many of our societies's taboos,the catholic church and many of the facts that we consider right. Everything, of course, with lots of jokes and irony.",9,2005
"Ok lets start off with the good..... it had funny moments but thats about as far as it goes.  I have read some reviews and I can't believe how some people think that this movie is thought provoking.   It is far from it, nothing but cliches and many jokes, some funny, some not.  We've heard all these bible/catholic comments before which makes this movie totally unoriginal.  This movie was totally idiotic, if it wern't for some of the comedic moments this movie would have no value whatsoever.  I am not a religious type so don't cast me off like that, this movie was horribly written and just boring at times.  If you want a dark comedy, go see Very Bad Things which is very original, unpredictable and a riot.  Dogma just doesn't work at all.",1,1999
"Overrated would be my review for most of Kevin Smith films.  I am still not sure how on Earth he has such a cult following.  The only film of his that was good, was Chasing Amy and even that had its flaws.  He also has the pleasure of directing a film that is on my top five worst films list which is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Be that as it may my problems with Dogma are a little different than most of his films.  The first time I saw it I kinda liked it.  The second time I realized how bad it was.  First of all choosing to satarize the catholic church, especially in film form, is like writing a love poem.  It's been done so many times you had better do something new or different, Smith does neither of these.  I think of the films of Buneul, Felini, certainly the Monty Python stuff, certain Woody Allen films and so forth and that's what I think of as good satire of the church.  There are countless others that did the subject so much better than here.  The biggest problem that I had with Dogma is that the film had no idea what it wanted to be.  It kept switching from semi-serious film to farce.  Normally I don't have a problem with genre bending, but here it shouldn't be done.  If this film was a farce than all the serious elements are out of place and pointless.  If this film is suppose to be more serious, say just a normal variety of comedy(for an example ""As Good as it Gets""), all the farcicle elements become really asinine.  Take the reasoning for why the universe is going to be wiped out of existence.  If this is not a farce(and I mean Marx Brothers, Monty Python brand of farce) then that idea is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve to be thought of.  First of all if we are focussing on the catholic church, perhaps we should consider what they actuall believe.  According to the bible(not a bible nut, just happen to know this) angels can't be redeemed.  Period.  No confession, no archway, they are angels and not humans.  According to this films premise, if Lucifer walked through the archway he would be able to go back to heaven.  Of course he'd have to cut his horns off, I would imagine going with Smiths wing thing.  In this case, why didn't Azreal do it?  He was also an angel cast down, why couldn't he walk through the arches and undo all of creation? They are not human beings and therefore not subject to the same rules. End of discussion.  Too much of this film is trying to make a ""serious"" commment on religious dogma, and it tries to do so by ignoring what the catholic church and the bible actually says.  Couldn't Smith come up with something not totally idiotic to hinge the film on?  Since this is the base of the films story I must say that this film is completely pointless.  Outside of that the Jay and Silent Bob stuff here is really annoying and their pressence is pointless and forced.  Then of course there was the scene where Kevin Smith showed how bad of a writer he is when he gets out of the S*** Demon sequence by using odor spray.  This is moronic and worthy of a Junior High school laugh.  Even S*** Demon repelant(ala Batman style) would have been funier.  The truth is, Smith knew of no better way to get out of the scene and he is a very sloppy writer.  He isn't much better as a director as there is absolutely nothing visually interesting about this film, and that is the directors MAIN job.  We are after all talking about a visual medium. In the end, seriously don't waste your time with this, it is horrible.",1,2004
"First of all, I want to say that I'm Catholic and I was not offended by this movie. I'm a firm believer that one has to laugh at oneself throughout life in order to keep one's feet firmly on the ground.",1,2007
"This film is one of the TOP 5 worst movies I've ever seen.  From an incredibly long, rambling story-line and pacing, to sub-standard acting (even by actors I've previously, and subsequently, enjoyed and/or admired in other films [Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman]), to its silly attempt at ""deep thought"" and imposing a certain ""enlightenment"" on the audience. The film was quite simply, BORING.  Most humor was completely degenerative (I'll site the giant monster made of bubbling, human excrement, for example!) and completely un-original in plot (to anyone who's ever read a book of theological philosophy, science fiction or even a Marvel comic-book). I always get the feeling that Kevin Smith is winking at his audience, smiling and thinking to himself, ""Look at how CLEVER I can be!"" and ""Laugh Here, Now."" This film in particular seems to be a circus trying to present itself as a stage-play, and in my opinion, not hiding the fact very well.  ""Dogma"" reveals itself with an over blown message and theatrics at their worst. (...And, quite frankly, his characters Jay & Silent Bob, are a ""one- liner"" stretched way beyond the punch-line.)",1,2002
"This is a cleverly constructed movie with wits to it. I like some Kevin Smith movies, some of them I just don't I however enjoyed this one. I didn't particularly found this movie to hilarious or anything like that, but like I said it does have wits. It might offend certain Christians that take things way to hard, but for others they might find the movie to have close to the right amount of balance to it (what I mean is, it didn't really seem like it tried to step over the line). The cast were all great and each of them brings something to the table. This is more than a journey movie about getting from point A to point B to accomplish a mission. But more so on the interaction between the characters that adds to it's humor and wits. It just seemed like Kevin Smith put a lot of his own thoughts and philosophies about Christianity into this. Which he does in a lot of his movies, excluding the Christianity part. It's a intriguing movie that some Christians may agree with and others will disagree with but most will at least will be intrigued with. It's a movie with cleverly constructed satire that takes on more of the modern street angle to Christianity. This had potential to be better if it had more exploration on intellectual parts and how to expand on that. Even if the overall plot doesn't make much sense when it comes to God. But maybe I am just being a bit nit-picky. Overall this is a movie that the audiences could have a entertaining time with, even the Christian audiences if not taken way too hard. It might offend the Catholics though.",7,2014
"(I'm not Catholic, nor do I know much about Catholicism, but I am convinced that God does exist, and, and, He/She does have a sense of humor. I mean, She would have to, especially after seeing this movie...)",10,2014
"The true measure of a family film is to watch a child's reaction. My (normally jumpy) three-year-old sat with enraptured glee through this movie and was able to articulate the plot back to me with amazing detail. That's not a parent's rambling, its a credit to a brilliant movie. Tarzan ranks just below Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid in the list of the best of Disney's new films.",8,1999
"... or no, a 15, maybe.",10,1999
"Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed?",8,2003
"I found this surprisingly good because not only was animation well done - which they all seem to be in the past decade - but an involving, action-packed story that was interesting start-to-finish. The action is not overdone, however. The color in here is magnificent and it looks spectacular on DVD.",8,2006
"Well, being the big animation fan that I am, I went to see Tarzan this afternoon.  Wow.",8,1999
"Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr That is the main phrase of what Tarzan uses when trouble is about to  come. I did enjoy this movie, every minute of it, it was made in 1999,  i think it was is the first ever tarzan movie to be made into a catoon  and to be made by Disney. I you like this movie then i am pretty sure  you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of  Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions  he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant.  I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see  Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there  will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.",10,2004
"This movie draws a sense of awe throughout the entire story.  Though its plot may be formulaic, it executes better than any other formulaic movie this year.  This is the best animated film  I have seen in the last 5 years since ""The Lion King"".  The images are absolutely wonderful to look at. The music by Phil Collins is so powerful that it energizes the whole movie making you feel emotionally charged all throughout.  I feel this film could have never been made in live action, since it gives a totally new perspective on what Tarzan may actually have been like, his movement, his upbringing, and most of all, his interaction with jungle family.  The musical sequences by the gorillas were silly, but entertaining (it is a Disney film isn't it?).  And Tarzan's movement through the jungle is so spectacular that it makes Aladdin's flying carpet escape from the lamp's abyss seem pale in comparison.",8,1999
"I loved ""Tarzan""! ",10,2005
"Tarzan is considered to be the final film of the 'Disney Renaissance'. It's hard to argue with that, as it was the studios last big box office hit and widely acclaimed film for a number of years. It is also a story that is perfectly tailored to Disney's style given its strong underlying themes and emotive characters. Importantly it understands the key aspects within the story as it provides a lot of feeling and intrigue to what is a straight-forward story. Tarzan's parents are killed in the jungle, he is raised by apes and he later battles the feelings that he doesn't belong with them. It is rather bare when you look at it like that, but Disney knows that what is important is seeing these characters grow and change through the challenges put in their way. ",7,2015
"From 1989 to 1999, Walt Disney studios created some of the most amazing, mind-blowing animated movies of all time. From the little mermaid to beauty and the beast, from Aladdin to the lion king, from Pocahontas to Hercules, and finally, Mulan to Tarzan, these movies still hold their staying power to today. However, Tarzan was the last of these films, from the period known as the Disney Renaissance. Disney remains a popular animation studio in the public eye, but no one could deny how popular they were throughout the 1990s.",9,2015
"From its dramatic opening sequence, to its jubilant, high-five finale, Disney's ""Tarzan"" is, without question, a very entertaining re-telling of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale of a helpless, human baby reared to adulthood, in the jungle, by a band of gorillas.",7,2015
"I liked Tarzan very much! The story is not exactly a new for anyone, but it was cute to watch and I have some fun! Tarzan lost both of his parents when he was a baby, and the guilty one was Sabor, a strong leopard that kills almost anything that moves. At the same time he was orphan, Kala, one of the female gorillas of the gorilla group,also lost her and Kerchak's son to Sabor. One day when she was very sad, Kala hear a baby's sound and searching everywhere, she sees Tarzan and take him to care as her son. Kerchak does not approve Tarzan in the group and also does not consider him to be his son; to be honest, he does not like Tarzan very much. Some years have passed, and spite of the difficulties, Tarzan had a great childhood and has many friends in the gorilla's group. And he considers himself a gorilla, but a different one. But when Jane,her father and Clayton come to his land to study the gorillas, they find Tarzan and his primitive ways. At the same time Tarzan discovers that he is a human, he starts to like Jane more than a friend, and also to know the human language as well. But Clayton has other plans about the gorillas...and they are not good.",8,2006
"Disney's 1997 film Tarzan is often overlooked, partially because it's a stand alone film that hasn't been inducted into a franchise of princesses and also partially because the rights to the character of Tarzan are still tightly guarded by the estate of his creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs. Even still, it has proved itself to be a technological feat with a story, music and design worthy enough of being called a Disney classic.",9,2016
"A family is shipwrecked and stranded in the jungle. Sabor the leopard kills the parents and Kala the gorilla rescues the baby. Despite leader Kerchak's disapproval, Kala raises the baby naming him Tarzan. Brash gorilla Terk befriends him and they meet fearful elephant Tantor. When Sabor attacks, Tarzan saves Kerchak and the group with his spear. Professor Porter and his daughter Jane are studying the gorillas led by their hunter guide Clayton. Jane is chased by a pack of baboons and Tarzan rescues her. Tarzan becomes torn between the jungle and going with Jane to England.",7,2015
"Based on the famous series of novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950), Disney has come up with a pretty entertaining adaptation of the beloved literary character.",7,2009
"This movie is perhaps misunderstood, you may look at the cover and think that it is yet another disneyfied classic ruined and altered until it has been worked into the Disney formula, this may have happened a little, but it is not about singing monkeys roaming around aimlessly...",9,2009
"Disney's new animated feature, ""Tarzan"" has made it into theaters and moviegoers will certainly leave satisfied. Mainly because the previous years fare has been rather disappointing; Disney made a comeback with 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"", and hit their peak with 1994's ""The Lion King"", and they've been heading pretty much downhill ever since. After slowing their plunge with last year's ""Mulan"", it seems ""Tarzan"" is their attempt to begin climbing back to the top.",8,1999
"This is really a good effort from Disney, for they are able to pull something off many movies do not succeed in, they have made an interesting, exciting, moving and funny film. It is even harder, I presume to do such a thing with a story that has been told often before and everyone knows and then to get it done good as an animated feature is even harder. This is (in my opinion) a much better effort than for instance A bug's Life (I haven't seen Dinosaur, Mulan and Toy Story 2 yet) and that is the reason why for me it is the studio's best effort since Hercules.",8,2000
"It's unusual for a Disney animated feature to be anything other than successful, and Tarzan doesn't buck the trend. It is a solidly entertaining animated feature. Which is not to say that it's perfect.",7,2009
"Tarzan is a very good film indeed, and is without doubt the last great Disney movie. It only has one flaw, that's it, and in comparison to Hercules (weakest Disney of the 90s)that's saying something. The animation is just gorgeous. I have been to Africa, and never have I seen the African Jungle look so beautiful. The songs, performed by Phil Collins mostly, are very pleasant, though I must confess, that I did get annoyed once when my sister played ""Two worlds"" at loud volume on the computer, for what felt like an eternity. The characters are great, Tarzan is a wonderfully charismatic lead. My favourite character was Jane, thanks to a brilliant characterisation from the underrated Minnie Driver. Terk and Tantor provide great comic relief, and the gorillas provide plenty of quite emotional scenes. The weakest character, was the aforementioned Clayton. Although Brian Blessed voiced him with enthusiasm, Clayton wasn't particularly likable. The main reason why I like this movie as much as I do, is the thoroughly human portrayals of the characters, and it was also the first time in a Disney since Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame when I cried at the very end of the movie. Who would, it's really emotional. Tarzan is a must-see for Disney fans. It's not perfect, but it's miles better than the trash out today. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9,2009
"Wow, there are a lot of bad votes for this movie here. I thought it was great. It's a Will Smith / Barry Sonnenfeld movie. You can't take it seriously. The humor is perfectly subtle and dry at times, and over the top at others. The storyline is only there to give opportunities for the jokes.",8,2004
"Lets take a cult classic and make as stupid idiotic movie as you could possibly make and cast it with actors COMPLETELY unsuited for the parts. Kevin Kline, Will Smith, and Kenneth Branaugh should all shoot their agents. Sure they probably picked up a nice paycheck for this crap but can you ever live down being associated with such a ""Wanker"" project? For a television series the Wild Wild West was well done for its time and had a lot of interesting plots and characters. What possessed the creators of this movie vomit to trash the Wild Wild West. Hopefully someone will come along and make a serious movie on the television series. Sad to see these SCUM come along and try to make a cheap buck on the creative efforts of others and destroying their original vision. I always wondered how Robert Conrad could go alone with this junk. Then I read that he didn't. He picked up the Razzie Awards as a protest.",1,2005
"I won't add more insults -- others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First, how about getting someone to write/direct that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the West-Gordon relationship was the core. In a sense, West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick, functional crime-fighting machine: West handled the action and romance, and Gordon took care of the thinking, deception, and humor (disguises). This was a well-used TV convention -- think the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad in Star Trek, or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix (not an offensive atrocity like the film-Loveless) and you've got a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.",1,2008
"Buried in this god-awful disaster of a movie is a germ of an inkling of an iota of a great idea. It is not the idea of making a big blockbuster out of the great old 1960s TV show ""The Wild Wild West,"" an idea which can, at best, be described as tiresomely uninspired. Nor is there brilliance in transforming the image of the lead character just so that they could build the role around star-of-the-moment Will Smith. But out of that horribly perverse example of Hollywood commercial packaging there is an intriguing premise, which naturally seems to have slipped past all involved without a second glance. What if the best, brightest and most intrepid government agent working in post-Civil War America was, indeed, a black man? Realistically, how would an African-American, functioning in a repressive, racist society, where even the most liberal thinker would see him as a second-class citizen, indeed, a second class human being, be able to not only outsmart the bad guys, but to impress even the skeptical good guys? It is an intriguing idea because, on the one hand, such an agent would not be suspected of being a threat and, on the other hand, he would have to overcome so many more barriers than a white man would ever face. He would be both invisible and yet stand out like the proverbial sore thumb just about anywhere he went. He'd be constantly fighting two battles. Such a film could be thrilling and funny, yet something rare: original.",1,2005
"No other stinker in 1999 could compare to the witless and tasteless experience that was WILD WILD WEST, a big-budget bomb of epic proportions that is a total disgrace to the TV western of the same name.  Will Smith is James West, a slick gunslinger who, along with his partner (Kline) must prevent a political assassination and save a town from destruction. Unsatisfying visuals and second-rate special effects only add to the horrible acting and the film's unclear direction.  It is so disappointing to see such good actors wasted in such a terrible mess.",1,2004
"I actually walked out of the movie before it was over, and I suspect that audiences everywhere will experience a similar impulse. The movie (I dare not write its name) is another one of the countless pictures that must have been written by some kind of experimental Hollywood software. It takes several excellent actors, one wonderful special effects marvel, shakes them up and out pops the same crap every time.",1,1999
"Wild, Wild, West was a fun, exciting, action packed movie that had wonderful acting by Will Smith (especially Will), Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, and Keneth Branaugh. This movie was one of Will Smith's funniest movie's yet. I think Will is an incredible actor with a lot of talent and charisma. This movie is a must see for anyone with any taste at all. If you don't like this movie you have to be the most boring, unimaginable, unintelligent person there is on Earth. Wild, Wild, West was 100 times better than Star Wars and is the movie of the year!",10,1999
Apparently there is a lot of feelings associated with this title.,10,2015
I realise this 'film' was a fantasy of a kind but even fantasy has to respect certain laws. All the monstrous machines were steam powered and as such would need lots of coal and lots of water. Where did it all come from in the desert and who shoveled it? Also magnets only behave like those ones around the heroes necks in cartoons.,1,2013
"As a fan of the original TV show, I was really rooting for ""Wild Wild West"" to succeed.  Imagine my disappointment then, when it turned out to be a complete failure, a dud of a movie, a huge disaster; in a word, it just plane sucked.  There were so many mistakes and errors made by the so-called ""filmmakers"" that I'm not even sure where to start.  First, casting Will Smith.  Unless your willing to completely disregard the history of the late nineteenth century and make race a complete non-factor (which is not what the writers chose to do) there is no way to sell a black James West.  Hell, the giant mechanical spider was more realistic than a black army officer in the post Civil War army.  Don't get me wrong, I love Will Smith, but because he is black this role was just not right for him.  Second, the writing. Four people are credited with the screenplay, and God only knows how many others ""polished"" the script along the way.  Yet, with all this talent involved, the end result is hideous.  It reminds me of the old maxim that a thousand monkeys randomly typing on typewriters would produce Shakespeare sooner or later; well in this case, they had a lot of writers carefully and selectively typing on typewriters, and they didn't get within a parsec of Shakespeare.  The story and characters were all wrong (they needed to look at the original show, which got it right), the dialogue is truly pathetic (I got real sick of West and Gordon saying ""We have to save OUR president"" ""That monster is after OUR president"") and NONE of the jokes work.  The absolute lowest point was when the writers tried to milk humor from a lynching; perhaps in their next effort, the writers will find the humor in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, or the killing fields of Bosnia.  The musical score was also a complete failure; it was flat, unimaginative, boring and unengaging.  The music should have been building suspense, providing a rousing theme, etc.  Except, about all it provided was a headache and all it roused was my ire.  ""Wild Wild West"" is the posterchild for the hallow, overhyped Hollywood movie that is supposed to be a guaranteed blockbuster (see also ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Avengers""), and it truly deserves the heaps of scorn and criticism which have been dumped on it.  I can only pray that Smith's next project can restore his now tarnished reputation, and that Barry Sonnenfeld never makes another movie again as long as he lives.",1,2000
"I'm not sure if anything short of burning the negatives could improve this film.  A plotless mess that exists it some sort of limbo-history, where impossible and dull machines slog across a computer generated West (though most of the movie seems to happen in Washington or Louisiana).  Oh, and there are some actors, though I hope no one involved keeps this one on their resume.  Kevin Kline is wasted, Will Smith is uninteresting, Selma Hayek is tacked on, and Kenneth Branagh is shrill.  Pointlessly crude, this is a film that should not have been made as it pales before the original series, or even a napkin with the words ""Quality"" on it.",1,1999
"I never saw the original TV show, so I can't compare, and I'm willing to concede a comic-Western-meets-James Bond-type show could work, but I know this much; this movie doesn't work.  The story drags on too long, the so-called gags are lame, some fine comedic actors are left twisting in the wind(only Branagh held my interest for awhile, and I even got tired of him), and it's hard to believe Barry Sonnenfeld, who made the ADDAMS FAMILY movies and MEN IN BLACK so entertaining(not to mention GET SHORTY) could make a stinker like this.  Some nice photography by Michael Ballhaus, but that's it.",1,1999
"I generally avoid paying full price for first-run movie tickets because of this sort of drivel. Unfortunately, I let some friends talk me into making an exception, and I actually sat through this clunker. It was a hot July day, and the theater was well air-conditioned, which is all that prevented this experience from being a total waste of money.",1,1999
"This movie sucked big time. Not that I had high hopes but all the actors involved have actually acted before. Some of them more frequently than others but hey (Will Smith acted once see ""Six degrees of separation""). Salma Hayak as always is pretty darn hot but not even her nice little package was enough to resurrect this ball of dust.",1,2006
"Buying this film I had in mind The Great Race and I expected to see a funny comedy with modern effects and intricate gadgets. Unfortunately the film crew failed to shoot a comedy but shot an implausible story that could hardly have taken place in the American West. It seems to me that people of the 19th century had more respect towards the President than our contemporaries. Anyway, the genre of the film is said to be comedy but the film is anything but funny. It's full of unnecessary violence and cruelty. It's hard to say what IS funny in it. The Great Race could boast a hero and a villain but whatever tricks they played on each other they never resulted in severe damage, if the worst came to the worst they threw cakes at each other or fell sprawling in the mud. Nevertheless, the vice was punished and laughed at. It was not frightening , it was ridiculous. That's why one could safely show such films as The Great Race to children; I for one saw it first when I was 5 or 6 and I still enjoy it. Maybe films of the kind should be shot in this humorous vein. I myself do not mind my p's and q's and can appreciate a thriller or an action film with all the gore and blood if the violence is justified, but Wild Wild West is not the case.",1,2000
"I've always heard people saying ""I was sleeping watching..."" and I said ""There's no movie that deserves to take a nap while you are watching"" WWW proved me wrong, (even tough it's not worst than Mr. Magoo), this was awful...c'mon I thought I was going to laugh and I nearly cried.  Will Smith was funny just in the opening scene, not even the beautiful Salma Hayek make it worth to be seen.  I was very disappointed with all the hype and the promotion this film got.",1,1999
"When I saw this film a couple of years ago, I was sixteen, I sort of loved it. Seeing it again, not in my teenage years anymore, I realize that 'She's All That' really is for teenagers. I still like it, yes, but now that I have seen so many more movies there are a lot of predictable, therefore lesser, parts.",6,1999

"I'd actually recommend seeing it if you don't feel like a heavy movie and just want to watch something fun. The movie is 'another teen movie"" but does have some unique aspects to it, some pretty funny quotes (""what is this, the dork outreach program?"")and moments, but unfortunately, a lot of that average teen movie drama and a few overly two-dimensional characters (Zach's friends and girlfriend). Cool dance scene though, and Freddie Prinze Jr. is bearable Rachel Leigh Cook is likable (I personally thought she was pretty good in it) and notably talented actors like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Anna Paquin give the movie some supporting foundation. Not a bad movie, not a great movie, just simply what it is:'another teen movie'.",6,2005
"Loved this movie. Great for a date, good for a laugh, entertaining and a sweet romantic comedy.",8,2007
"There are some movies that make me just stop what I'm doing and watch. Braveheart, Clear and Present Danger, Casino Royale, Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Top Gun are just a few that come to mind. Not all are classics, but all have _something_ to them that engrosses me. She's All That is one of those movies.",8,2009
"I'm actually surprised at all the negativity aimed at this movie. But I really shouldn't be, you know? It's a formulaic, stereotypical movie about high school and teenagers. In short, it's another teen movie (Not Another Teen Movie - get it?). But there is something disarming about ""She's All That."" It's sweet, it's funny, it's cute, it's charming, and it's kind of innocent (in its own unique way, of course).",8,2012
That the IMDb score is way too low speaks I think to the fact that the intended audience for the film was ... disappointed. Perhaps expectations were too high? Perhaps this story had been done once too often. But the odd fact (and the thrust of this review) is that the film is memorable because the stars rise above the material .... before they themselves burn out and lapse into film obscurity.,7,2014

Laney is an ambitious art student, Zack decides to take the bet and he starts talking to Laney. Difficult at first, Zack actually warms up to Laney and they find out, they have a lot in common. Slowly Zack starts to fall in love with her, while his best friend starts to be jealous and he will do anything to ruined the bet.",8,2010
I just saw this movie for the sixth or seventh time on television and I wondered what Rachael Leigh Cook was doing these days. So I checked the IMDb and to my amazement I saw that this movie is rated with a miserable 5.4! What the hell? In my opinion She's all that is one of the best movies in it's teenager/highschool/romcom genre. The story is comfortable predictable and all the performances (from Freddy Prinze to Rachel Leigh Cook and even Matthew Lillard - who's pretty hilarious) are great. We also find Paul Walker (pretty scary!) and Anna Paquin in one of their earlier roles.,9,2008
I loved the movie it had a good plot and great acting. This movie was so good it won like 8 awards. It is your average teen movie. Zach Siler(Freddie Prinze Jr.) makes a bet that he can turn and unpopular girl Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen after being dumped by his girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). The movie has some aspects of a Rom com with the odd witty comments. Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook play the characters amazingly they give you a great impression of the character and how they react in certain situations. If you have seen Not Another Teen Movie then you will find the plot line similar thats because they stole It from She's all that. This is a amazing typical romantic teen movie that will make your heart melt and i strongly recommend it for girlie nights in.,10,2007
"While I would never put this film up with the contender teen flicks (American Pie for instance), if there was a pick between this and Bring it On, I'd go for the first.  The story follows a smart, preppy, and popular teen (Freddie Prinze Jr.) called Zach who gets dumped by his girlfriend, but then takes a bet the to turn a outsider art girl (Rachel Leigh Cook has some great charm and sexuality) into prom queen.  While I wouldn't call this the best idea to turn someone's mindset like that, the film makes it almost work, and slightly (though never completely) makes Zach's lifestyle apealing.  Sweet romantic comedy, though it isn't a quality flick. B-",5,2000

I honestly think Zac shouldn't have really changed Laney but really let Laney change for herself like!",9,2015

"It was fun, but the idea is a little used. I have seen a couple of movies like this, but this one was actually entertaining, it had a good deal of jokes, but also is´s sappy moments.

There is the gang of posh, snotty nosed bullies, the nerds, then all the people in between, and this film shows what happens when the two extremes come together and clash.  It depends on which group you fitted into at school as to whether you will like this film or not... If you were a nerd, or anyone in between, you'll love it, because it shows that the bullies don't always come out on top.",10,2000

"I never give a second thought to any teen movie, specially the prom-movie craps, but I liked this movie....because most of the stuff in this movie was not blown out of proportion.

The way Leaney half-smiles, the character was SO strong, SO cute and SO lovable and SO sad....would give anything if something like her happened to me in real life. Loved her geeky talks. When she talked about the ocean, or the children in Mexico, or when she says to Taylor ""....this is the reason why I always avoided places like these and people like you."", never met anybody so soft like her. When she trips in her red dress and cries...her eyes covered with her hair.....you should listen to her voice at that time. She is a very good actor. Somehow she made ME feel romantic....which I think is an achievement. Didn't like Zach tough (Freddie Prince Jr.), was too perfect, almost stupid. You should also see her when in the last scene in which she bursts into a laugh, when Zach accepts his graduation without his clothes, because he lost the bet. He does it for her, because he had fallen in love with her and she becomes more important to her than his bet. But somehow in the movie her hair keeps on growing long and short.....weird!!",4,2005
"Easily one of my favorite comedies, and sort of a source of medicine for the pains of working in an office with complete idiots. Ahh, cubicle life. Anyone who's ever worked in a corporate office can relate to this film on some level, and can probably swear that they know someone exactly like one of the characters depicted here. Mike Judge really captures the aspect that makes office life so miserable, which is without a doubt the characters that you must deal with that your personal life would normally exclude. There is no question that he must've had his own bout with the way of the office bitch, as he shows that he knows it all too well. Out of the comedies I've seen, I can most identify with this one.",9,2004
"It still boggles my mind that this classic working-person's comedy was overlooked at the box office. Unlike today's dumbed-down, unfunny comedy-schlock, Office Space's script was carefully written before the camera began shooting. Based on his Milton shorts, Mike Judge wrote and directed Office Space and did a great job. The film is cleverly written, nicely plotted and paced, and holds interest even after repeated viewings (something I can not say for most comedies).",9,2007
"Every aggravating thing about working in an office, from the traffic on the way to work to that damn copier, is in this movie, and dealt with in ways that we've all wanted to, at some point or another. Well, except for the traffic, of course. The traffic  remains undefeated. Besides telling a highly amusing story about office workers who are just fed up with it all, Office Space is full of other little comments on society, such as the way the film points out the sheer goofiness of geeky white guys who listen to hardcore rap music. The film presents a heavily exaggerated version of the typical office, but underneath that exaggeration, the depiction is very accurate. You have the fairly timid but passive aggressive superior, Bill Lumbergh, portrayed hilariously by Gary Cole, the repressive office cubicles, the mumbly guy that kind of weirds everyone out, and of course, the disillusioned office employee who just doesn't care anymore.",9,2001
"I must admit,I did not think much of Office Space when I first saw it in the theater,but I've seen it several times since,and I have got to say it has grown on me quite a lot.This is an appropriate tribute to people like me everywhere who hate their jobs.I am not a big fan of rap music,but the rap score somehow makes the film even more appealing.The plot is hilarious,the characters are hysterical,and it's just a fun movie.If you hate your job want to feel at least a little better about it,this film is for you.",8,2001
"Incredibly true-to-life story about life at work.  Anyone who's ever worked in a large office will find at least one thing, probably more, that they can relate to.",10,2004
"Life in the office couldn't be portrayed more accurately in this wicked satire by Mike Judge. A sleeper cult movie, OFFICE SPACE doesn't have that much of a plot as an idea, where every possible cliché of the ""employee"" and the ""manager"" is brought to existence during the first half.",8,2005
"There's something about a study of life in a `cubicle' to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In `Office Space,' writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us `Beavis and Butthead') captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a `corporate structure' is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly `motivational' talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate `mission statements' and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them. 	The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for `Initech,' who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- `efficiency experts' sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about `fifteen minutes of real work' a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out. 	Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the `everyman' who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as `Champion of the Cause' as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate. 	The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of `flare' who has trouble `expressing' herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the `Dilbert' comic strip, `Office Space' works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the `corporate experience' in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at `the boss,' and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.  I rate this one 8/10.",9,2001
"I honestly don't think there's enough good things to say about Office Space. It has everything a great film needs: A great story, great acting, great jokes, great soundtrack, great everything! Hell, we even get to like the characters, as with most films no one cares. Even though this is a comedy, it actually deals with a very big issue: disillusionment. And most comedies of this type don't do that sort of thing.",10,2004
"If you work in a cube, and love satire, this is your movie! Those who would slam it probably do not get it and that's fine but those of us who do will see it multiple times. This movie does for office workers what ""This Is Spinal Tap"" did for musicians. That means it may not be a movie for everyone but for those chosen ones, it means getting together with friends a couple of times a year to enjoy a classic and quote it constantly on those other 363 days when they're not watching it! If you are a cube dweller, then I need you to go ahead and check out this movie, uh that would be great. I too rated it a 9 because of the gangster-rap soundtrack. Save for that, I would've gone ahead and rated it a 10.",9,2004
"Arguably one of the most quotable movies of today's average working stiff's generation. Lumberg and Milton are such classic characters you must be seriously independently wealthy and never worked a day in your life to not be able to identify with a classic movie like Office Space. Thank goodness dudes like Mike Judge exist in Hollywood. I can't imagine a world without a great little flick like this still kicking around. While it would never be considered Oscar type material, I can't help but to think that after all these years, this movie remains among the most tragically over-looked and under appreciated comedies. For no great critical reason other than pure fun factor and pop culture relevance, Office Space remains firmly, a true classic of our time.",10,2007
"Falling Down meets Dilbert is the best way to describe this suburban tale of cubicle dwellers who are tired of getting screwed by ""the man.""  While the story line is nothing spectacular, the dialog and acting keep this movie moving at a brisk pace.  Ron Livingston, who was excellent in a supporting role in Swingers, plays an everyman who hates his life, job, and girlfriend but has no idea what to do about it.  The supporting cast of co-workers are greatness representing just about every office sub-culture perfectly albeit to extremes.  Jennifer Aniston completes the male fantasy aspect of having your cake and being able to eat it as well as serving as a conscience for the protagonist.  Several scenes will have you rolling in the aisles.  The Boyz in the Hood kill the copier scene is the funniest I have seen in a while.",7,1999
"Mike Judge knows quite well the characters he has gathered in a fairly large office. It could be anywhere in the country. Most of us spend most of our lives doing jobs that are not rewarding and they become a dull routine. In large places, like the one we see in the film, some of the supervising personnel are pompous and love to bully the people under them, which is the case with Bill, the coffee drinking supervisor, who loves to make Peter's life miserable with the petty little details, like not having the reports with the proper cover sheet.",10,2006
"There is only one movie ever made that correctly depicts life in the American corporation. This is it. From the ritualized assassination of a copier to the gutting of fresh catch in the cubicle, this is a fantasy tour for the cowering, paranoid, and bored technology worker trapped in the oppressed land of Lundberg and the TSA reports.",10,2009
"As someone who is recently retired from cubicle life in the software business, I have to say this movie hits all the high points. Every nasty, annoying, nonsensical facet of life in the high tech world is lampooned here in a highly intelligent, perceptive and hilarious way, from the grating voice of the secretary answering the phone, to the endless memos on insignificant subjects, to the constant watching your back to see who gets laid off next. They even have the fashions right, as witness the matching tie and suspenders of the boss we all hate. I can see how viewers who have not lived this life might find the movie pointless, but for all of us who have been there, this is a must-see film. Particular mention must be given to the brilliant (I don't use that word often) script, which makes so many subtle points so effectively. I think this is going to go down as one of those ""sleeper"" classics. I myself had never heard of it until my former boss (herself a victim of the downsizing portrayed so hilariously here, although not so hilarious for her) mentioned it in a meeting. If you love ""Dilbert"", this is it brought to the screen.",8,2008
"This is easily one of the funniest movies of the past ten years and, you guessed, one of the funniest comedies ever. I saw it 99, when it was a new release on video and I didn't think it was that funny. I saw it about a year later again, and found it hilarious. (Could have been that I was smoking really bad weed back in 99 and I was also 19 years old). This is one of the most re-watchable comedies I've ever seen, and I think that has to do with a combination of things. For one, it is brilliantly written. The dialogue is incredible. Also, all the actors give great and hilarious performances. The story is great, and the pacing and mood of the film is perfect. This is a ""must own"" movie, because you can watch it repeatedly and it never gets old. Mike Judge is a genius!",10,2006
"In the Initech office, the insecure and bored Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) hates his job and the abusive Division VP Bill Lunbergh (Gary Cole) that has just hired two consultants to downsize the company. His best friends are the software engineers Michael Bolton (David Herman) and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) that also hate Initech, and his next door neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader). His girlfriend Annie is cheating on him but she convinces Peter to visit the hypnotherapist Dr. Swanson (Michael McShane). Peter tells how miserable his life is and Dr. Swanson hypnotizes him and he goes into a state of ecstasy. However, Dr. Swanson has a heart attack and dies immediately after giving the hypnotic suggestion to Peter. He dates the waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and changes his attitude in the company, being promoted by the consultants. When he discovers that Michael and Samir will be fired, they decide to plant a virus in the account system to embezzle fraction of cents in each financial operation into Peter's account. However Michael commits a mistake in the software and instead of decimals, they steal a large amount. The desperate trio tries to fix the problem or they will go to prison. ",6,2010
"I usually start laughing at the opening traffic scene and don't stop until the end! It is funny all the way through. My husband and I put this flick on whenever we need some light comic relief. Everything works in this movie. The actors all do a terrific job. I especially love the awesome facial expressions! All the characters are really comical in their own way. Even the supporting characters are funny. What makes this movie great is that anyone who has ever had a job can relate to it. And it's one of those that the more you watch it, the funnier it gets. Each time you pick up on more hilarious expressions and subtle humor you might have previously missed. Enjoy!!",9,2007
This is a really excellent little film from Mike Judge but all involved have done a fantastic job.,10,2009
"A movie that snuck up on me, Office Space is one of those films i saw for the first time and went 'meh'. It was OK, but i had heard this film had such a devoted following, i was expecting big things. But over the years i have for whatever reason wanted to come back time and time again and revisit it. its one of the very few movies that after about 10-15 viewings just does not get stale or boring. its not laugh out loud funny, but its situations are captured with such an observant eye, you cant help but identify with the characters and smile in acknowledgment as you recognize a similar situation in your own workplace.",9,2008
"I did not follow The Office on UK television, in retrospect a mistake, perhaps, but after seeing this, and Nine to Five, and others, I am so glad I never had to put up with this. It all rings gruesomely true, because the performances make it so credible: it may be hard to believe in anyone as terminally nerdish as Milton, but he was very well played, and so was the Lumbergh character. I suspect everyone who reviewed this has commented joyfully on the complete mashing of the printer - also, maybe, everyone who has ever used a PC or a Mac and got enraged when it throws a snit and decides not to boot up or to crash or just not to do something for its own arcane reasons.",8,2007
"I can't think of too many movies I'd watch 5 or 6 times a year, but ""Office Space"" definitely makes the cut.",10,2006
"'Office Space' is, without question, one of the greatest films ever made. Forget using big name stars, multi-million special effects etc. For script and characterisation alone, this is pure genius. This film goes back to the fundamentals of what makes good drama; something which is so often overlooked these days in favour of CGI and FX.",10,2005
Without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.,10,2005
"This show was one of the best on television and always struggled to stay on the air and that is crazy although not surprising. Unique shows like this do not fair well on television. It lasted 3 seasons and this first season was one of the greatest first seasons that any show could ever produce. People might have been turned off by too much sci-fi or romance, but i thought they did a great job of balancing the two and it is a shame not enough people watched this show. The chemistry between Behr and Appleby and Fehr and Delfino was just great. They are all great actors. The romeo and juliet aspect of the show was very unique and rare for this age of TV. I first saw this show in 99 i was 17 and could relate to the characters very well, alien part aside. This show can be enjoyed by people of any age or gender. I highly recommend buying this show on DVD even if you never seen it before its well worth it. People afraid of the sci-fi part should know the aliens are just like humans no green skin or big eyes. They just simply can do things normal humans cant. The first episode Max (behr) heals Liz (appleby) after she is shot and their lives are changed forever. They both fall in love from their and their problems also start because now the sheriff and FBI start to suspect something isn't right about Max.The alien part of the show is what causes a lot of problems that are impossible to have on other teenage dramas, which is why its unique. Katims who is the creator behind the show is just a genius. So again I highly recommend this DVD set. The second and third seasons will be out soon enough.",10,2004
"I missed the TV episodes of ""Roswell"" because I worked nights when it was on television, but my daughter found the 3 season DVD's in a store, bought them, and invited me to watch them. I was hooked on the series from the first episode on, and I regret that it is no longer being produced. I enjoyed the romantic involvements, the comedy, the drama, the many heart wrenching scenes, and loved the final episode. When the last episode ended, I felt a great sadness that I would likely never again see these lovable aliens and their human friends. It was a show that left an indelible impression on my mind. It brings out the youth, dreams, and fantasies in all of us. I can think of no other TV show I've watched that I loved and will miss so much. I hope to see a motion picture come out of this series one day, one featuring the same actors and actresses who starred in the TV series. The series showed the ups and downs of everyday life which we all experience, and showed there is always hope for a new and better tomorrow, if we truly believe in ourselves. It was a great philosophical show. And now, it is gone. I will miss it, but I will never forget it. Thank you 20th Century Fox for giving us the show.",10,2006
"""Roswell"" is probably not one of the few shows that really sticks with you. It's not ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", it's not ""Six Feet Under"" or ""Dead Like Me"". It's not groundbreaking or brilliant, but it's a very nicely entertaining show with a heart.",5,2008
"I have to admit I boycotted Roswell when it first aired on TV. I was just not interested. I had just started to watch Buffy and thought Roswell would be kind of a copying show. But hey, I was wrong. I didn't hesitate to buy the DVD and I am happy I did, because those lazy nights are great to be spent with such a TV show like this.",10,2005
This series was amazing. I watched it on the WB in 99 and followed it through to the end on UPN. I purchased all 3 seasons on DVD and I still can't get enough of it.,10,2007
"i advise you utter and complete honesty not to watch this show.... i have intense stamina for digesting even the crappiest of films and TV shows and sit to the end without skipping a scene and i am pretty good at taking in all sorts of bizarre and nonsense ideas...and i am CULT follower on Roswell and alien landing etc (feel Free to judge my mental health). but this show is way beyond my patience...imagine yourself...u must have seen plenty of those HIGH SCHOOL sort of films in which the girls first boyfriend is is always a ace football player now take ALL the elements from such films and mix them with ALIENS AMONG US IN HUMAN FORM theories and opinions and you have ROSWELL TV show. now u tell me could it be worth watching in ANY way ? i have watched 7 or 8 episodes so far of the first season and it is utter nonsense and pathetic....i have lasted it so far thinking that MAYBE if i somehow manage to finish one season it might get better by then but honestly...i am not very hopeful...and i am surprised and shocked that this show is rated 8.4 ? this show is probably written/directed/created by someone who is expert in making teenage high school films and who wears kids dresses and talks like """"""DUDE!! i just had this totally crazy idea about this whole Roswell thing...now imagine a cute chick dating/falling in love with a shy guy who is an alien in human form....and we gotta put in some FBI guys after them just like X-files mojo u know?...it sounds pretty cool right ? hey u told me Ur dad works for TV i am sure he can swing some budget for us to shoot this show and i am like totally sure its gonna be huge...and don't worry abut actors u can bring Ur cousins in all i want is Katherine heigle cuz she has these TOTALLYy huge boobs"""""". i hated the show ALIAS and always wondered how it lasted so long but i have to say if things like ROSWELL can last 3 seasons then alias surely deserved to last so long. in short its been made by people who i call DTK (DUDE..TOTALLY...KOOL) people...imagine the quality and creativity yourself.",3,2009
"I'm astonished at the amount of positive user comments for this show. Apparently a lot of people like very jejune shows with melodramatic acting and a hefty dose of teen angst, poorly-developed story lines and insignificant character development... If that's your thing, you'll LOVE this show. Initially the kitschy quality of the weird sci-fi elements coupled with coming-of-age conventions appealed to me -- however, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a contemporary of Roswell, accomplishes this about a gazillion times better. This show takes itself too seriously, there is not enough humour (another thing Buffy had pined down perfectly, the combination of clever pop culture references and snappy wit that this show sorely lacks), the characters become quite unlikeable as the series progresses, the story-line is overblown and contrived without being interesting, there are too many details that are not resolved / explained properly, and it's hard to tell if the actors are decent or not, since the script is so crappily written. If you like stuff about aliens, watch X-Files; if you like high school shows, watch Freaks & Geeks; if you like cheesy crap, watch Roswell.",2,2007
"This was three shows in one. In descending order of quality, they were:",4,2002
"I love the show ""ROSWELL"". It will certainly be very missed because there is no other show like it. Hopefully the producers along with the cast can get together again and continue with the seasons. I definitely recommend people to watch it, trust me, you'll get hooked on it! Its been 6 years since the last season but I still get some of my friends to watch it and when they do, they cant stop. Not only does the show have action ( something always going on) it has love & romance specially between Max and Liz ( Jason Behr & Shiri Appleby). By the way he is so romantic and Hot in the show. If you're a romantic person you certainly will LOVE IT!",10,2008
"I started watching Roswell in 1999 when I was still in highschool. One day I was flipping channels and came across this show. I didn't even realize I was on the space network until it went to commercial(Canada only had this show aired on the space network). At first I thought it was strange the show was about aliens but the storyline was so good that it didn't matter to me, I was instantly hooked. The love story between Liz and Max and the emotions and fear felt through Isabel, Max and Michael felt so real that I began to go thru their journey with them. I devoted myself to this show and during that hour I was hypnotized. Unfortunately the space network was cancelled and Roswell was forgotten, I never got a chance to finish it. It was not until I watched Swimfan on TV this summer (starring Shiri Appleby), that I remembered how much I loved Roswell. I went and bought Seasons 1 & 2 and once again I am hooked. I have not seen Season 3 yet, I haven't read many good reviews on it but I will judge that for myself.",10,2007
"Yet another show destroyed by the networks. Seems all the teen paranormal dramas get smothered by control freaks, it's really sad. We saw it recently with Point Pleasant. These shows have the potential to be great, but are never allowed the sky to spread their wings and take flight. But, that's the description of a crime, and this is supposed to be a review, so let's get to it.",8,2006
"Jason Behr, Katherine Heigl, Nick Wechsler and the writers of this show insulted Buddha and Buddhism with their rude and disrespectful comments and insinuating remarks. If they had made these kinds of comments on Christianity or Islam they would have immediately complained about it so why did they make this exception for Buddhism.",1,2010
"I LOVED this movie. Not as great as ""50 First Dates"", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was ""cute"" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. With all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! Drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of her best roles!",9,2005
"This is a truly hilarious film and one that I have seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as her brother. You cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like! Her outfits are wacky and weird, and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! The gorgeous Michael Vartan was adorable as the teacher (wish there had been teachers like that when I was at high school!) and Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a film you could watch again and again, with a fabulous sound track! One for all those at school in the 90's to watch!",10,2005
I think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress Drew Barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something I never imagined her being. A great flick with lots of laughs . I don't usually go for those feel good movies but I really enjoyed this one.,8,2000
"I can't say that I embrace this as a Romantic Comedy, as I found little funny about it. I did find it endearing, entertaining, heartwarming, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, I found them more bittersweet than outright comedic.",8,2007
Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. Actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age I doubt I could pull it off the way Drew does.,7,2008
"Very sadly, I can relate to this movie, as I'm 17, and have yet to be kissed, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review I re-watched it, and remembered everything I loved about it.",7,2005
"I really tried hard to like this film. After all it has the adorable Drew Barrymore, and the mesmerizingly beautiful Leelee Sobieski in it. It had promise in some scenes, but all in all it's a very lack-luster film that feels way too forced. It is chalk full of the usual overdone Hollywood stereotypes and standard formula, and there just isn't enough good laughs to make up for it. I must say that Leelee Sobieski who plays the schools 'biggest nerd', is by far the hottest nerd I've ever seen, in real life or in Hollywood film. I'd even join the math club to get next to her. I only gave this film a 5 because it was worth a watch based only on seeing Jessica Alba covered in dog food, and mostly for seeing Miss.Sobieski in a one piece skin tight body suit. Leelee's body in that skin tight suit was by far, the greatest highlight in this overly stupid and rarely funny force fed wreck.",5,2010
"This is a very predictable little story; but the finale is the most romantic I've seen in a while. A 25 year old copy editor for a Chicago paper gets her first assignment as an undercover reporter. She ethically blows her own cover, ruining her story; but turns in an alternate story about her real experiences in high school.",5,2000
"Never been kissed starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named Josie Gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High School was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally ""fit in"" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.",8,2004
*POSSIBLE SPOILER*,7,2002
I saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. I have the DVD. It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. ,10,2007
"I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It's got all the essentials I look for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor...a lot of heart-warming moments too. The flash-back moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry though. Every single time. I'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even though it is, in a way, a teen movie. Sure, if you're a guy, and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time, then this isn't for you. But if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great in this one!",9,2006
"Josie has never been kissed, she was just an unpopular, ridiculed nerd in high school. But now Josie is 25, working for a newspaper when she gets a chance to go undercover and report on the high school scene. Drew Barrymore stars as Josie, and as usual, she is very cute and charming.",6,2010
"I thought this movie was really awesome! One of Drew's best. I am also a fan of Michael Vartan so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would want to watch this movie over and over again if I could. I also loved the ending. This movie clearly has shown a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love them both so I also highlighted this movie. At the end, when Drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in High School. Again, the movie was amazing. Defiantly a 10/10. Hope this comment was very useful to any IMDb readers.",10,2007
"I saw this movie for a first time years ago, when it was still new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood make-belief story for teenagers. However, it's not lifelike. As much as you would want to believe it, these stories never happen. That's why it is irritating to watch movies like that. They play with teenagers' minds, just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea isn't worth a 10. There are a lot of films about teenagers. So why don't we make a better one?",8,2005
"I'm not a fan of teen ""comedies"" but this was on ITV at the weekend so I thought I'd give it a go. I didn't know much about the film except that Drew Barrymore (I'm not a big fan) was in it and what genre it was classed in.",6,2003
"it doesn't matter whether drew or leelee are total babes, but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy. This movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for ""real"" people.  It made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this movie represents the real world and that what really matters.",10,1999
"To me, NEVER BEEN KISSED is a good film that's very funny, romantic, and touching. I thought that Drew (Barrymore) and the entire cast did an outstanding job. Even though I've only seen a few of her films, I think she's a good actress. I felt sorry for Josie (Drew Barrymore) because she was tortured in high school. You poor thing. Each time that happened, I wanted to cry. This was because I could sort of relate to how she was tortured. Even so, this film made me laugh at times. Mainly, it made me feel good. To all you Drew Barrymore fans that have not seen this film, I highly recommend it. When you see it, prepare to have a good time and be touched.",9,2005
"This film looks like it was written by people who never went to high school, who instead formed their impression of human experience by watching TV shows. Watching this film, you'll learn:",1,1999
"In today movies, is very hard to found good teens comedies, but famous ""Mean Girls"" (2004) proves that this genre is not death. And i think that films like ""Never Been Kissed"" (Althoug its 8 years of been realized) are another great teen comedy with successful characters that don't fall in an awful cliché, as its plot.",10,2007
"Wonder how old most of the reviewers, here in, are? Read a few pages and most are raving... about? ",1,2006
"A rich slice of modern life presented wonderfully by Paul Thomas Anderson. Nine or so ""broken"" people are followed through the film, each of them at least vaguely interconnected to the others. We are shown where they are currently at in life, and find out what has happened to have brought them there. By the end of the film, they are finally at a point where they can confront what is making them so unhappy and perhaps take control of their lives and look forward to a brighter future (even if their time is limited).",9,2003
"And it is a FILM.  It is no ordinary movie.  As a fan of Boogie Nights, I couldn't wait for Magnolia.  Although its running time has made at least 20 people leave the auditorium, I have stayed for every single second.  The mood and stories and characters keep building and building and building, and when it finally comes down, I feel this immense sense of relief and wonder at how PT Anderson was able to come up with something so clever and intertwining and wonderous, and was able to pull it off.  This ""movie"" is not for everyone.  It is thinking-hat required.  I have also never been so excited to look up Bible verses before. The cast, as you have probably read, is superb.  I have never been so impressed.  This film has ""restored my faith in the filmmaking industry. To see these actors, crew, and the writer/director/genius at work is inspiring.""  These people obviously love their craft, and one of my friends even said that the cast was ""touched by the hands of God..."" to which I whole-heartedly agree.  He also has said, """"This film not only teaches film makers how to make films, but it teaches movie watchers how to watch movies!"" to which I again whole-heartedly agree a thousand times over. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely outstanding as the only character who is ""normal.""  His performance has made me smile and shake my fist in the air the three times I've seen Magnolia since it opened.  Tom Cruise is also spectacular.  As with every single last character, every line he utters is important to his character and what it means for the rest of the stories. Another outstanding performance/character is the part of police officer Jim Kurring, played by John C. Reilly.  His character is just so perfect and JUST SOOOOO PERFECT that it makes me smile every time he is on screen. Add to all of this one incredible soundtrack, and you have something that will go down in film history as legend and probably one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, and definitely underseen films of all time.",10,2000
"Never have I seen a more smug film than Magnolia. It's a movie that thinks very high of it's self. It's not an important film or the masterpiece everyone thinks it is. I find it funny seeing the defense of this movie because dissecting a movie shouldn't be rocket science. Like the smugness of Magnolia as it's cast seems to wink at the audience saying ""This is deep material we are covering here"" the fans of Magnolia seem to say that if you don't appreciate this film you don't have their level of intelligence. Magnolia isn't overly complicated, it's a three hour mess about self-hating individuals complaining about how life has been so cruel to them. We are meant to think it is quirky and intelligent by having over the top performances and an overpowering and unfitting soundtrack in the background.",5,2008
"""Magnolia"" is a film of great passion, wonderful directorial virtuosity and stunning acting. In an age when filmmakers are afraid to make films that are actually about something. P.T. Anderson made a film that is about the most important thing: simply living day to day with all the tragedies and frustrations that can happen in our lives. That he does it with an incredible energy and spirit and passion makes the film even more powerful.",10,2001
"A serious wake up call to the land of cinema has arrived with the incredible film MAGNOLIA. Human pain and suffering, as well as the ability to avoid making familiar mistakes, are hypnotically explored in P.T. Anderson's intricate motion picture. This is the best movie I've seen in over a year and hopefully will set a new example of realistic cinema depicting real human loss and tragedy. You grow and suffer with each and every character in this huge ensemble movie. ",10,2000
"Magnolia is a film of epic proportions.  A film that is our generation's. It's about real life, real people and real coincidences.  These things happen, this is happening as Stanley Spector states.  Magnolia is as perfect a film as you will see these days.  P.T.'s camera acts as the protagonist, and the ensemble cast is one of the most solid in film history.  Told in 24 hours, set up by a remarkable prologue and finished with a beautiful epilogue, Magnolia finds beauty in the darkness of life.  In the redemption of the filth life sometimes brings us.  It shows us that we are all connected through pain and suffering and sinning and yet, it does not give us this pessimistic view.  Certain films cannot be described, they must be viewed and everyone should view this masterpiece!!!",10,2000
"I remember being startled when I saw ""Magnolia"" back in 1999. I enjoyed it throughly and I sang PT Anderson's praises. We're in 2007 now - two days into the New Year - and I decided to see ""Magnolia"" again with a couple of people who were seeing it for the first time. Shocking really. The brilliance is still all there but I couldn't help seeing through it. It all felt so damn calculated that its smart ass phoniness took over my senses. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance made me ""feel"" something. When I was with him I was somewhere and Tom Cruise is fun to watch. Julianne Moore is unbearable and the whole movie drags from, by now, predictable turn to predictable turn. The frogs are wonderful but they are just frogs pouring over the Valley. I'll see it again in another six years and let's see what happens. I feel that Mr Anderson, if you forgive the impertinence, needs a doses of humbleness. Talent he has, in enormous quantities.",6,2007
"A film such as Magnolia does not come around often enough.  Though I felt that Boogie Nights attempted the same effect: exposing the base, unrelenting, human desires of Angelinos, it failed in several ways. Magnolia does not.  Mr. Anderson sets out to show the underbelly of Americana, much like Mr. Mendes has done spectacularly with American Beauty. At the end of the century, these two films stand as landmarks in the evolution of the American.  What we pursue in name only, piety, commonness with our fellow man, family, fame, fortune, and peace of mind, come crashing together in Magnolia, in an apex of misfortune, misunderstanding, forgiveness and renewal.  These two films should scare the living daylights out of Americans, especially those living in Los Angeles.  The stories show us that merely giving lip service to morals, self-improvement and camaraderie is not enough, we can fake it for only so long, before life overtakes us in a deluge of happenstance and retribution.  Mr. Anderson is a wonderful storyteller, and Magnolia is the most visually and aurally satisfying film in years.  Ms. Mann's music and the ensemble acting are symphonic.  This movie is as tightly composed as any work in cinema one can remember.  Obviously, I highly recommend it.",10,2000
"I can't tell you how angry I was after seing this movie.  The characters are not the slightest bit interesting, and the plot is non-existant.  So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first of all, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible (a significant portion of the population) or Charles Fort (a still larger portion). As a somewhat well read person, I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode.",1,2003
"I rented this movie from Blockbuster without knowing anything about it.  I was hooked from the opening scene until the final frame and was sad to see the movie end.  The character development, plot, and acting were magnificent.  I was moved on many levels and felt almost every conceivable emotion at one point or another.  The characters seemed so real to me that I was hard pressed to think of a movie that had the same strong level of character development across the board.  The only negative comment I can make is that I felt like there were a couple loose ends when the movie finished.  But this may have been intentional and was a minor blemish in an otherwise very fine film.  Even Tom Cruise reached new levels as an actor in this film.  I gave it a 9 out of 10, only because a perfect 10 is a once in a lifetime film in my opinion.  A must see for serious dramatical movie lovers.",9,2000
"That is what this film is about and ""Strange things happen all the time"" are the best ways I can think of to describe the overall plot of the film.  The story of a dozen people, on one incredible day, in one very wet valley, on Magnolia Avenue.",10,2000
"The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood. I won't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.",1,2007
"Forget American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, Eyes Wide Shut. Magnolia is definitely the best movie of 1999, and one of the best American movies ever made.",9,2000
"Magnolia is an exhilarating experience for any film lover who wants and desires for films that go above and beyond what the vast majority of movies produced today will give to the audience. Got to the theaters and all you will see are mainstream productions completely formulaic, money-driven and without any real emotion or power. It is a fair argument that all film producers care about today is making a profit, getting the audience in and out as quickly as possible and waiting for the next big thing. Paul Thomas Anderson is not such a filmmaker.",10,2010
"It both humours and kills me to see so many users glorifying this film. I can tell that Paul was hoping to achieve a lot with Magnolia, and im sorry to say he came up seriously short. ",1,2012
"I'm sorry, but as I write this, voters here have ranked this as the #103 film of all time.  It's just not that good.  In fact, I didn't even like it. A lot of great actors deliver some great performances, but the movie is so all over the map that it doesn't seem to know what it is trying to say. And, as an unbreakable rule(which bad directors keep breaking), if a movie is going to be more than 3 hours long, it had better be as good as Citizen Kane(which clocked in at just under 2 hours). At least a long movie like 'Heat' is an action thriller.",1,2001
"The dialogue: Repetitive, cliché, full of cursing and is in no way original.",1,2008
Seldom has a movie been this highly praised been such a pointless bore.3 hours plus to build up to precious little.yes the acting is good but the film goes nowhere very very slowly.if this is so great why did it fail.in my opinion just like Fight club people a few thousand enjoyed it while the more entertainment driven mainstream audience chose wisely to avoid this.i made the terrible mistake of buying this on dvd i soon traded it in.,1,2001
"I have to admit, I was looking forward to seeing this film. My money situation was tight, so I pinched it from a friend's house, darted back home and felt as though I was in for a treat. I started watching it, and the introduction looked promising. I have no problem with long films; as long as I'm entertained I'm happy to watch a film for any amount of time. At this point, I didn't actually know it was 3 hours long, but it had only been playing for 10 minutes, and I was enjoying it. The cast looked excellent, and I enjoy films that are a bit peculiar, often dealing with a wide range of characters and how chance and fate interlaces them. So I continued watching...",1,2007
"I saw Boogie Nights before Magnolia, so I was obviously excited about this film. Three hours later, I found that my excitement had turned to boredom.",2,2005
"Those who enjoyed Mangolia have a habit of rubbishing the opinion of those who didn't, and dismissing them as ignorant, brain-dead and bereft of emotional appreciation.",1,2000
"Never, ever have I seen a movie so bad.  It started off ok, but then as it when on and I realized I didn't care for the characters, I became exceedingly bored.  Not just me but almost everybody in the theatre was the same way, one guy started yelling stuff out, and it was funny and everybody was laughing.  On the way out the staff asked us what we thought about it, everybody was saying it was awful.  The review I saw on the internet that was the best is ""Twice as long as the Blair Witch and just as bad"".  The never ending movie, with no point, and those of you who have found one, it's so convoluted, that I don't care.  I wanted all the characters to die just so it would end.  Spoiler -- The raining frogs part was retarded, abso-freaking retarded.  This movie represents a downslide in movies on a whole have been going on for a long time.",1,2000
"Looking at the IMDb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them(the top ones at least)were quite outdated,written in 2005-2006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes.Having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 movies(strong world,film z) as of the day I'm writing this review.I hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it.I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.",10,2013
"Let me start by saying, I don't understand Japanese and I'm a huge fan of Naruto, Shippuuden and Bleach (of course, all original Japanese versions). One Piece was shown on Cartoon Network when I was 13/14 & I thought it was lame. Now, I see why it was lame, it was 4kids English version which was pretty horrible. ",10,2010
"I watch a lot of fan subbed anime and occasionally watch some dubbed anime if there is nothing else good on TV. Well one day while watching Toonami in the UK i stumbled across show called one piece. It wasn't amazingly good, there were obvious problems with the dub, but it was enjoyable none the less. After i'd watched few episodes i started to become curious about the characters and the origins of the story. I did a little bit of research on the web and found out that the version of One Piece i was watching had been butchered from its original format. There were A lot of sources that all said the same thing, that the original One Piece was brilliant and that the dub was nothing in comparison. I liked the show and wanted to see what Uncut One Piece was like. After a little more searching i found some fantastic fansubs and my real One Piece experience started. What can i say, Japanese One Piece is one of the best stories ever told and is by far my favourite show to watch. I look forward everyweek to watching the next episode when the fansub is released. 280 episodes into the series and its still as great as it was when it first started.",10,2006
"On first glance, One Piece is not too different from other Anime series. It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.",10,2006
"I don't know what to say...I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best. Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter, agony, suffering and so much more. Kudos to the One Piece's production team especially the amazing creator, Eiichiro Oda; for creating a world that is beyond ordinary but still can amuse ordinary people like me and you.",10,2010
One Piece is an excellent show. It's exceedingly funny and I guarantee that you will laugh. The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them. ,10,2006
Well after watching this show for quite a while i noticed one thing. The English dub is horrible and all the scenes of the so called violence are cut out. ,10,2007
"I used to watch One Piece as a kid occasionally when I came home from school, but stopped watching at a point, because it was too much of a ""kids thing"" for me. In the last years a lot of people told me it is worth watching even known it is animated, because the story makes the series perfect! So last year I started watching it from the beginning and I already can't stop! The whole story gave me moments to laugh and moments to cry but all in one it really makes me happy to watch the adventures around the straw hat crew. If you ever have the time to even watch one episode.. give it a try!!! Maybe there are sometimes fillers and episodes that are focusing on the wrong things for too long, but there always follows an episode that is sooo amazing that you can't even think about stopping!",10,2012
"I have watched a lot of anime, however one piece is one of a kind, after watching all the episodes, I'm finding it really difficult to enjoy any other anime, I wish there is another anime similar to one piece, because I just cannot forget it. The arcs, the characters, feels like I am on a journey with Luffy to find one piece and to become the Pirate King!",10,2013
One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time.,10,2014
"It tops every other show I've seen. watch the funimation dub though, the 4kids is terrible in comparison. Every character has great chemistry with one another. It has a great action to comedy ratio. There are many twists you never see coming. It takes place during 'the great pirate era' and everybody is searching for the legendary one piece which is rumored to rest at the end of the grand line, the most treacherous sea in the world. It is the best show i believe I've ever seen and I'm not even one for anime. If only they aired the uncut dub on television I guarantee it would have been as big, if not bigger, than dragon ball z. Its not just a show for people who like anime but for everyone. One day it will hopefully be televised.",10,2012
"This is simply the best anime TV show or comic out there. In my opinion, it is also better than all non-anime TV shows. I am American, and I do watch almost all the shows produced here except crap like Jersey shore and 90210 and and stuff like that.",10,2012
"One Piece, what a simple title for a manga. You first read that name and wonder what's it about a bathing suit, a place, your not sure. You then open the pages or watch the first seconds of the anime and learn that the story is really about a world of pirates and that One Piece is actually a treasure that once belonged to Gold Roger (later you learn his real name is Gol D. Roger and that he is connected to something call the Will of D. good stuff) who was considered the Pirate King, the dream of all pirates to be. HE was executed 20 years before the story began and before he died told the world that his treasure was waiting for whoever could find it at the end of the Grand Line. You then come to the story of Monkey D. Luffy (wink wink maybe there is a connection between the two). Luffy is a naive, happy, curious teenager with a body of rubber which he got from eating a devil fruit ( a powerful fruit which gives the eater amazing powers but robs their ability to even swim, drowning them if they even try to swim, you find out there are hundreds out there and each with different abilities) Luffy dreams of being the pirate king and to be better than his mentor Red Hair Shanks one of the most powerful pirates on the sea. Luffy on his adventures meets new and exciting people and his crew gets larger along the way first his first mate and swordsman Roronoa Zoro, the sniper Ussop, the cook Sanji, the navigator and thief Nami, the doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the archaeologist Nico Robin, the shipwright Franky, and the musician Brook. One thing that sets this crew apart from all other pirate crews is not only is there crew much smaller then the others but also that each has their own special dream and are the best at their specific job. As you read the story you find out that each crew member has their own strengths and weaknesses but that they also wouldn't be around if each crew member wasn't their to help, making each person invaluable to the crew. Also you find out that unlike what many people believe Luffy is not your typical pirate he doesn't go from port to port robbing and pillaging the innocent people he actually has helped many people with problems with other pirates and can't see a friend hurt. Whats also interesting is while their are good and bad pirates the World Government which are the leaders of the world, which who are suppose to help the people are also bad and good and that the leaders have a dark secret that you begin to learn about much later. All in all the story is so well done not one arc is wasted, not one character is wasted, even minor characters get their story told and you learn of their dreams. Eiichiro Oda brings so much emotion to this story. You will cry I promise you even the toughest of guys will cry in some arcs. You will laugh there is no doubt about it the crew is just to crazy for you not to laugh. You will cheer for the crew and hiss at the bad guys. There is nothing more I can say about One Piece it is an experience that will touch you and make you rethink mangas. You will soon love One Piece as much as me and thousands if not millions of others do to.",10,2008
"One of the extraordinary shows of the world.When I started it I didn't realize that this show will have a effect on me.But I was wrong.Guys if you think the show is only about pirates,then you are wrong guys.",10,2014
"One Piece, what can I say? It has become a part of my life, wait no, One Piece is my life. It is the most beautiful thing mankind has ever created. All thanks to mastermind Oda. Starting off with facts of it being the highest selling manga and being in the Guinness book of world records, also having an extremely dedicated fan base which no community can ever have. It's simply the greatest story ever conveyed and portrayed in a comical form. As I've seen many movies and TV shows(which includes American TV Shows, Indian cinema.) Read thousands of books, no story has ever enlightened and amazed me as One Piece did, I personally feel it to be on par with Mahabharata, Ramayana & Shakespeare's works. 732 episodes, 819 chapters still looks fresher than ever, without being monotonous, not only it entertains you, it scars you for life. A show so strong, that it changes your life. A show so good you can never stop watching. It's more addictive than any drug in this world. Coming to the characters, Monkey D Luffy, even people say he is typical Shonen material, he is the greatest protagonist a story can possibly have. He goes from dumb & funny to badass & idealistic. He's like a brother I never had. Roronoa Zoro, a lad so influential with his quotations, you start following his mannerisms in real life. With many characters and their unique personalities. I don't want to spoil anything for you, get amazed by the characters by yourself, I'm sure Oda will never disappoint you.",10,2016
"I'd give this anime a huge, whopping 10 if it's rating the Japanese show. The American ""kiddy-cartoon"" though...can we give half-negatives? -_|| Please? Darn you 4kids. More than 30% of -their- show has been cut and changed. The names, the attitudes, the actions. Entire episodes and arcs have been taken out. Was it worth it to make a show, 4kids, that was NOT INTENDED for the 6-11 yr. old demographic and force it into that category? Haven't you squeezed enough $ out of this wonderful Japanese phenomenon? Yet the Japanese anime... Oh goodness yes. I couldn't rate it enough stars! Comedy/drama/romance, whatever you want it has it, along with a fabulous music score and marvelously innovative characters. There's something for everyone (even an anthro that isn't a let-down like some anthro characters are in anime shows.) I just can't stress enough to people: buy the Japanese DVD's! If you complain that this show is annoying and you can't stand it, more than likely you're watching the hack job that 4kids produced. I'll admit some people just can't stand Oda's odd style of elongating people, and his very unique styled characters no matter what. But you can't say it gets stale fast. I'm up to episode #160+ and it's still going strong...past 260 as far as I know.",10,2006
"Shonen manga is a really biased genre. Not only for people who only see manga as ""japanese cartoons"", but for people who only like Naruto or hate all shonen too. One Piece, however, is so original and deep that any art critic could look at it as a romance book rather than plain entertainment. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year old boy who consumed a mysterious fruit which made his body have rubber properties and his dream of finding a legendary treasure called One Piece, thus becoming the Pirate King. My description sounds dull, because it is really hard to explain even one percent of the complexity of this show. It is about dreams, about promises, about the value of life and about so many things that every new arc becomes a new life experience. Of course, the quantity of episodes may scare people, but after some few arcs, it makes the viewer feel every single message transmitted through the story. The storyline is really surprising, and every new episode can change what you thought to be certain. The details are not spared by the author, and are commonly used in further episodes. This attention to small things make the story progress in a beautiful and quick way. The character roster is rife with complex personalities/back stories, and it is really hard not to love them (with the exception of Donquixote Doflamingo). If you want some good story to laugh and have fun, you may like it. If you want adventures, art and romance, you will love it.",10,2012

Carter Blake is my favorite Thomas Jane role he played. It is my childhood movie I saw it as a kid, I never had a problems with the film. It is fast paced, entertaining action horror flick. The idea about Alzheimer's disease making sharks smart was brilliant.",10,2017
"Deep Blue Sea is one of those films that you simply cannot take seriously or you will go out of your mind with annoyance. It seems like the film makers thought about having a plot, but then they found they could have way more fun playing with the CGI Sharks (which are pretty good actually) The conversation between the film makers probably went something like this.",6,2006
"I thought Deep Blue Sea was one of the best shark movies created. I was very fascinated by the scientific part of the movie. The basis wasn't just on terror and blood. I think there's a real personal side to it for the lead character. She had watched her father suffer for years, and that drive and desire to prevent the same thing from happening to so many others gave the movie the obsession that it had. I found it refreshing that this movie had a woman obsessed with helping others instead of some risqué character obsessed with sex or violence. However, the other characters were not introduced to well. You never really found out anything about them. There were some suggestive hints about Carter having a background, but it was as if the movie left you hanging, or you got to make up whatever happened yourself.",8,2006
I've always enjoyed Deep Blue Sea since I was 9 years old. It's just so much to watch.,8,2012
"If 'Jaws' and 'Alien' had a baby, that baby would probably look a lot like Deep Blue Sea', a big, loud, dumb action movie that doesn't try to pretend to be anything else.

If that's the case, then this movie is simply ""Jaws"" meets ""Aliens"" via ""Godzilla"" or ""Jurassic Park."" It is a very simple premise. But this movie is all about the execution.",8,2008
"Deep Blue Sea is really more of a satire than anything else, despite the frightening image on the DVD cover. As you view this film, you will notice the tendency of the better actors to become shark food before the lesser ones. This actually leads to some pretty good surprises along the way.",6,2006
"i'm no professional, but i thought deep blue sea was an excellent shark movie. the sharks were scary, surprising and fast. i thought the casting was excellent (""carter"" was a cutie and the cook was funny) and i really liked the ending...no matter what anybody says. i thought the plot was good and simple enough that you didn't have to do any deep thinking really. and there really wasn't enough time during attacks for my stomach to untense. the girl scientist's accent got annoying at times, but she was a believable character. i wasn't crazy about samuel l jackson's character, but he made it work...and did i add that the shark attacks were scary and GOOD!! i'll admit it...i JUMPED!!",7,2005
"This is a lot better than people seem to think. Its a good shark movie, but completely different then the more sedate Jaws and some of the scenes are actually quite scary. When i first watched this i must have been 9 years old and i WAS scared. It has humour, shocks, action what more could you possibly ask for? Who cares about a complicated plot, this is a popcorn blockbuster which you will enjoy for 1 1/2 hours. The simple plot works (scientist finds cure for Alzeimers in sharks brains, unfortunately sharks brains are too small for the drug to be widely produced so the scientists create genetically modified sharks that are bigger so therefore have bigger brains. Unfortunately (again) the sharks get smarter and etc. Also this gets 5.5 out of 10 and Deathwatch gets 5.6 out of 10, no way is that very poor excuse for a horror film is better then this shark infested tale",7,2005
"Deep blue sea is without a doubt the best Shark film since Jaws. Since Jaws Shark films have been generally poor with the jaws sequels and lame shark attack movies proof of that. Deep blue sea does buck that trend but it itself is no classic, rather a mildly intelligent hunk of fun. The story whilst not completely cardboard is pretty simple, A group of researchers are testing on sharks in the hope of curing alzimers. They are doing their testing in a marine labratory and Samuel L Jacksons character has come to check up on their research. Disaster strikes and the sharks break into a flooded research centre and the group attempt to escape. The acting is average at times worse, but that is not what we've come to see the film for. It's the sharks and they are nasty and very cool looking. They have become super intelligent through testing and are maybe the deadliest we have ever seen on screen. The film has faults but it remains highly entertaining and is an effective thriller in its way.",7,2006
"This is true but that doesn't mean it was a great movie. The effects were just simply great, especially for a shark movie. Definitely ahead of the Jaws series and almost everything else in terms of effects.",6,2008
"The problem with shark films is that, once you hear about it, people immediately think of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece Jaws. So how do you approach a shark film without repeating Jaws? The answer is Deep Blue Sea. ",6,2015

"A team of doctors, scientists and other professionals are sent to a remote research facility to study sharks in the hopes of finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease. But the Bio-engineered sharks soon use their newly acquired intelligence to try and outsmart their human counterparts. One by one the team, a cast that includes Michael Rapaport, LL Cool J, Samuel L Jackson, Saffron Burrows amongst others, begin to be eliminated one by one as a struggle for survival begins when the sharks sabotage the facility by causing it to deliberately flood so that they (the sharks) can escape into the open sea. I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense and thriller aspects of the film, it wasn't too gory (compared to some other films) but the script as well as certain situations were very annoying and not to mention predictable.",7,2006
"A very short summary of Deep Blue Sea might go something like: ""dumb plot, dumb dialogue, dumb characters, dumb situations, pretty good suspense"". And that would more-or-less be that. If you like being jolted out of your seat, this movie contains five or six moments that genuinely deliver. That said, if you like movies with a certain level of intelligence and credibility, you might just as well watch an episode of Road Runner (which would be twice as believable and ten times shorter!) It's a fair comment to say that Deep Blue Sea is the very epitome of the no-brainer popcorn flick.",5,2005
Deep Blue Sea is very good shark movie. The cast is different and the acting is good especially by Jackson.Thomas Jane and LL Cool J was good and the scenes between him and his bird were funny.Saffron Burrows is really a good actress and a very good looking woman!I was disappointed that the great talent of Ronny Cox didn't say not one word:( The music by Trevor Rabin was great and the effects are awesome! I was surprised by who got killed and who lived. The making of Deep Blue Sea on the special edition was really good! If you like Jaws then see Deep Blue Sea because its just as good!,10,2003
"A group of people studying sharks way out in the ocean get more than they expected- the sharks have turned evil, huge, and smart.",6,2006
"I first saw the film when it came out in theatres and as a teenager then, I really liked it. Even now after watching it again, I still think it's one of the best shark films I've seen. The basic plot may seem unrealistic and rather weird indeed, but the action sequences and the script are really original and intelligent. The ending, especially, is quite unpredictable and I appreciate it very much.",6,2006
"I'm sorry, but I loved this movie!!  In fact, I thought it was even better than Jaws!!  I know I'll get a lot of flack for saying that, but that's just my opinion.  ""Deep Blue Sea"" had to be one of the best films of 1999.  The situation the scientists and other people in the facility had to face was interesting, and since the movie was action packed, I was never bored. These sharks really were a threat.  For one thing (**slight spoiler**), they had enough intelligence to wipe out every human being in the facility and be set free, and secondly, their massive size and strength was enough to make sure their plans were carried out.  I have to admit, some of the special effects were bad, but the overall movie was great.  Even though the sharks made the movie exciting, and Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great, the best thing about this movie was the ever-so-fine LL Cool J (the fact that LL was in this movie is what got me interested in it in the first place). This is the movie that really catapulted him into films.  In fact, almost every movie critic gave him praise for this film, and he deserved it.  He stole every scene he was in.  This movie and the movie ""In Too Deep"" were his best films.  So, if you want to see a lot of action, gore, jump scenes, or if you want to just see LL Cool J in a good role, go out and see this film. Bye!!",10,2001
"I saw this movie last summer and it was very enjoyable summer flick.. I went to see it mainly because of the director Renny Harlin which is one of my favorites. It was really good movie for a long time from Harlin ...well at some points actors didn't act very ""smoothly"" and the best actors of the movie were LL Cool J and Samuel L. Jackson... But the directing work was really great and I'm looking forward to see Renny's formula one movie... I recommend Deep Blue Sea to anyone who likes to see good action with nice special effects but remember to switch your brains off before you push the ""play"" button ;)",10,2000
"This movie had three screenwriters credited.  That was either one too many, or one too few.",1,1999
"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but never did. I didn't get a copy until a week ago and finally watched it with my girlfriend. I have to admit, I've seen it five times in the past week. A lot of teen movies have very basic or clichéd plots, but not this one. It's based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and it has a lot of interesting twists. The music is awesome, every song actually fits the moment, and the two love stories are actually interesting to watch. Even all the actors did a really great job. The only bad thing is the occasional dirty jokes. If you don't care for teen movies, don't worry, you are just like me, this movie is still worth watching. I'm giving it a 10 to bring those ratings up!",10,2004
"I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Granted I'm just 15 years old, and also a huge fan of Shakespeare, but it was really a great film. I would have to say it's definitely more directed towards the teenage/GenX generations, but it was awesome.  The tongue-and-cheek Shakespeare references were great (the ""Stratford"" girls, etc.) Julia Stiles & Larisa Oleynik were convincing in their roles, and not to be shallow but the guys of the movie just all looked really good. =) I recommend this to most teenage girls, although it's not totally a ""chick flick"" because my brother enjoyed it too.  In any case, the scene with the ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" ballad at the soccer practice is a can't-miss for all you love saps. =) I will tell you right now, the ending IS predictable, but not hackneyed. It leaves you with a happy bubbly feeling about teenage love.  Excellent movie, that is.  (P.S. When watching this in the theaters-- DON'T leave as soon as the credits roll.  There are some hilarious out-takes afterwards.)",9,1999
"A movie like this doesn't exactly hit you over the head with its originality, and can only be as good as the actors. They must convince you that you've never seen anything like this before. In this case every single member of the cast is so good that they sold me on the movie from minute one.  Heath Ledger & Julia Stiles make a great couple and his rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" was one of the highlights. When Julia listed the ""10 Things"" she was crying and I was, too - extremely unusual for me in a movie like this. Everyone else was just as good and this movie is a keeper.",9,2000
"All the praise in the world goes to every individual involved in the production of 10 Things I Hate About You,a film that rarely leaves my DVD player.I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's traditional plays,but the modern day screen adaptions are brilliant,and 10 Things I Hate About You is no exception.The highschool stereotypes of the cool kids nobody messes with,the wannabe's that try too hard to be something they're not,the geeks everyone picks on and the rebels everyone is afraid of,mean there's a character in this film everyone can relate to.The stand out performances are Heath Ledger as Patrick,the rebellious,feared and elusive bad guy who wins the heart of Kat Stratford played to perfection by fine actress Julia Stiles who has no interest in the opposite sex and is perceived to come from the planet 'Loser' while her more sociable,boy crazy sister Bianca (Larissa Oleynik)hails from planet 'Look at Me,Look at Me'.Her good looks catch the eye of the smooth,suave and egotistical Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) who is a male model,and fights for the affections of the prettiest Stratford sister with Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the highschool geek,with a big heart and a big crush on Bianca.The hilarious Larry Miller stars as Walter Stratford-the kind of father who puts his girls on a short leash and desperately tries to shield them from the horrors of sex,drugs and rock and roll,and of course,boys.A typical teenage comedy,but its witty dialogue,goofy,sexy,cool and bad ass characters,and enjoyable storyline set it apart from all the rest.There's plenty of memorable moments,romance,and clever and classic lines,all leading up to a predictable but perfectly good ending that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling about teenage love.",10,2005

"i know that teenage movies are extremely worn out, but this one will stay hip for ever! i think i will re watch it a hundred times and i will never get bored! why? because it's super cool!! you have the adolescents in your normal high-school, and you have the prom and this cute all-adored babe and this very hot and hip guy is after her but of course something is in their way: her sister! and we have our normal constant fight and arguing. but....there is Heath Ledger who is the ultimate babe and the perfect guy in this movie, and seriously gets you thinking 'why didn't this happen to me when i was in high school?'.the story is extremely cute and i think i can say original, anyways more exciting than the other movies that are in this category. there are some extremely funny scenes and you will never ever get bored! a must-see!!!!! and a perfect 10 score!!!!",10,2006
"Love love LOVE this movie. It is a classic, story is great, the actors are amazing, and the comedy is funny! There is something to laugh at every minute, and all the elements marry together perfectly to make a feel good movie, with depth and humour that isn't seen very often these days.",10,2015
"To see or not to see? That is the question isn't it? Although simplistic at times, I do recommend everyone to see "" The 10 Things I Hate About You."" The movie is yet another one of those adolescent modern stories that are based on old shakespearean plays. The difference with this one is that it does work. Why? I will give well what about 10 reasons for you: 1) Humorous screenplay 2) Well-ensembled acting 3) Julia Stiles 4) Adequate duration time 5) Julia Stiles 6) Larry Miller's obsessive parental performance 7) Julia Stiles 8) Nifty soundtrack 9) Julia Stiles 10) Feel good movie",7,2000
"I'm sorry but this movie tries way too hard. I understand the cleverness of the characters' names and all but the movie kind of over does the Shakespeare thing. It's like, ""I get it, you're basing it off of the Taming of the Shrew."" I'm really sad I didn't love this movie because I love the cast. How could you not love Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles? My problem is with the writing. Kat's character is unbelievably harsh and cynical. It's too much. and as for the teacher rapping sonnets? it could have been really cool but came off cheesy instead. Basically, the whole time I was cringing because of the script- not the acting. I'm truly sorry I had to give this movie such a poor review, but it just wasn't that great.",5,2009
"It's kinda weird that people say this story was based off of a Shakespeare story, yet no one ever mentions what this was based on. But 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the classic teen movies that came out of the 90's that was actually pretty good. It had a great cast, the story was original and a lot of fun, and the whole movie made you laugh and feel good. This was the movie that really sky rocketed Heath Ledger's career in America and I remember in school how all the girls were just drooling over him. Also all the guys fell in love with Julia Styles, she was also just awesome in this movie and made for a good strong female lead. This movie captured a great amount of what most teens go through in their world, wither it's just wanting to be different, popular, having an over protective parent, dealing with sex and rejection, this movie just worked on so many levels.",7,2003
"I'm 19 now (so was only 9 when '10 Things I Hate About You' came out) and I have seen this film way too many times to count. There have been countless sleep-overs, film days, random get-togethers and quite evenings alone that have all featured this film, so much so that I can now pretty much recite the entire script off by heart. Yet it is a mark of just how great this film is that, despite knowing it inside out I can still sit down and watch it and thoroughly enjoy doing so - it is and always will remain one of my favourite films.",8,2008
"Great movie for the teenage girls in us. This is my most favourite film ever! It appeals to the romantic in me as well as the (i hope) strongly minded woman in me. I love the character of Kat i think she's amazing and Heath Ledger is just so amazingly hot!! Some may see this movie as cheesy but i've seen worse cheese in a movie, you seen the wedding singer? that one is covered in brie!! I recommend it, i love it and atm i can't stop watching it!!",10,2006
"This movie makes me want to be a kid again. I loved it. Julia Stiles and Heather Ledger are just coming out of the gates. Julia is a perfect Cat to Ledger's Patrick. And I love the father in this movie, and his fixation on his girls avoiding teen pregnancy.",10,2006

"After hearing lots of good commentaries involving this movie, I thought maybe it would be a refreshing teenager comedy. Its title doesn't fit with the plot or story-- actually it makes sense only in a fast scene in the end. Several moments of this picture are similar to the controversial ""Not Another Teen Movie"", the difference is that ""10 things"" doesn't make jokes or references to other films. Heath Ledger doesn't show any differential in his acting-- people would never imagine him as the unbeatable Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" years later. Rest of the cast is just okay and the plot is the classic American stereotypical, just like in the other teen pictures. Don't expect too much from ""10 Things I Hate About You"".",6,2012
"...for a refreshing movie like 10 things I hate about you. Let's be honest, maybe back in the day when this movie first came out people thought it was only so-so... but having just watched it again after all these years, well I bloody well loved it. There was just something about the 90s. There was less technology to hide behind, feelings were more true, movies were more original and actually funny. And who would of thought the underdogs like Joseph Gordon-Levitt would of turned out as handsome as he has today? What I'm basically trying to say is give this film another chance because it definitely deserves more than 6.9/10 rating! It has everything: real visions of high school, crazy cliques, teenage angst, HEATH LEDGER IN GLITTERY TIGHT PANTS, real chemistry & etc. It was just a really cute, cute movie I don't know how else to put it. Instead of just everyone sleeping with each other throughout (ahem, seems to be a popular storyboard these days) 10 things had the works: Pretty boys aiming for the fresh meat, caring but somewhat psychotic parents (can relate), misconstrued images of one another, I mean the last one in particular DEFINED high school for me. No one was who you thought they were, in fact they were better.",10,2011
I'd give this film 11 out of 10 if I could. It is so faithful to the original Shakespeare play whilst being hip and up to date. I fell in love with Heath Ledger and in fact I began to watch other Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger films off the back of this. From the opening to the close this film grabs you.,10,2007

"Angel is a show that is going to live forever because it never gave in and changed itself around in order to be more friendly for the masses. I have no intention of giving each season or episode a number evaluation as I feel the entire body of the show is whats important. Well thought out story arcs were the norm in this amazingly diverse world inhabited by the most fleshed out characters on any TV show. A perfect example of this is the character Wesley who started as the comedic sidekick and slowly, over the seasons, transformed into a certifiable bad-ass without ever coming across as forced. Angel never treated the view like an idiot, never wrapped everything up in a nice little package after every show only to forget about the previous events in the next episode. Angel also never got stale, in part because it was cancelled in its prime by the WB for no solid reason as it was one of the highest rated shows on the network. Every season seemed to get a little better with the fifth, and final, season being the best, in my humble opinion. The show has become like an old friend to me which I can visit from time to time to remember what TV should strive to be like and to see an example of great story telling. In a time when TV is turning into a wasteland of trends and shows that do nothing but recycle, Angel was a bright spot which has sadly gone out. Buy the DVDs and let the show live forever as most of what else is on TV is already dead.",10,2005
"If you asked me a year ago what Angel was then i wouldn't of have a clue, now it's 1 of my favorite shows.",10,2005
"This is definitely the most underrated series i have seen. A series this good should easily have been given a rating of above 9.0. I have watched many series including Lost, Prison Break, The Shield, The Wire, The Walking Dead, Dexter But non of them are as dark, emotional and addicting as Angel. I wished this series could have continued 5 seasons are not enough for a story line so intriguing and perfect. Each and every element of the series is Perfect especially the intro music. Its my favorite music and definitely the most dark and addicting music ever. You might not like the first few seasons but please watch it to the end because after you finish the last episode I bet you'd agree with me that Angel is the best series there ever will be.................",10,2013
"Angel is a surprise to watch after getting through the Buffy the Vampire series. They're not really alike, except that both shows have weekly monsters (or sometimes do, other times focusing on mishaps with the central characters) and the 'Big Bad' (in this case, for a while, law-firm Wolfram & Hart). While Buffy chronicles what it's like for a young woman becoming a hero, the saga of being a kind of superhero with super strength but still being a regular human being, Angel is about its own hero of sorts, a vampire who has been ""cursed"" to help others and has a soul. So, he goes to Los Angeles, teams up with a few people- Cordelia, from Buffy, and Doyle (who didn't last long), Wesley (who did last long), and Gunn, a street hood who is his own kind of slayer- and opens up a kind of detective agency ""to help the hopeless"".",9,2010
"Angel starts out where Buffy The Vampire Slayer season 3 left off, with Angel, a vampire with a soul, leaving Sunnydale so that his beloved Buffy can have a semblance of a normal relationship, which the two of them could never have. The entire series can be divided into three parts, all of which take place in L.A., Angel's new home.",9,2010
"OK, this show never dissembled to the masses. In the episode I just watched Lorne says ""bon mot"" come on...how many shows let their characters use words/phrases 90% of the population has never heard? They make fun of themselves and refer to prior events - even as far back as Buffy. I love that sense of continuity. But the best, the very best part of this show is the dialogue. It's quick, intelligent and delivered by skilled words-men. Now, for the best scene ever in any show on TV, it is in Not Fade Away the very last episode and it takes place between Wesley and Fred/Illyria. It had me sobbing and even had my tough grown son tearing up - on his second or third viewing. It's really wonderful! If you are looking for entertainment, to be captured by characters, to have your imagination tweaked (but not your intelligence insulted), to spend an hour and not see the time go by...Angel is it. Rent it from year one to year five and you will not be sorry - except that it ended. (then go do the same with Firefly...you'll be outraged it ended in it's first season!) Have fun!",10,2006
"Today, everywhere I look there are vampires. They are all in struggle because they love some mortal girl, or just fighting each other for some reason. I like vampire stories, but those above are empty, boring, and pretty much the same. The last good movie I saw was Interview With The Vampire. I knew nothing about Buffy the Vampire Slayer or David Boreanaz. But then last December I started watching Boreanaz' current TV Show Bones, and after a few episodes I was hooked. Friends told me about Angel, so I got curious. I thought, if it's just another teenager show, I can stop anytime. So there I was, a little worried what I might see. But Angel got under my skin in the very first moment, and made me care about his beautiful, tortured soul. It dragged me down, but in a sweet way, made me cry for him, be happy with him, laugh at him, and sometimes even hate him. He fights for a better world, for us, for his friends and for himself. Last night I've finished the last episode, and I am sad it is over. But Angel left us with a very important note: There is still good in the world, that is worth fighting for. No matter what. I will do anything to by the DVDs and return to him whenever I want to. If you are like me (too late) and haven't seen it yet, you should take the time, you won't regret it. Of course you must be able to read between the lines and not only looking for blood and action. Now I will begin to watch Buffy to see how it all began. For those of you who understand: enjoy! And if you're not, feel free to use your remote.",10,2011
"Angel had its links to Buffy, there were crossovers and tie ins, and the similarities at the start of the show were noticeable. But as the seasons progressed and the characters became darker and the plots heavier, it seemed what we were watching was not entirely the same. As times have progressed, it seems audiences desire a darker more gritty version of TV, with shows that don't shy away from the harsher aspects of life, the Wire to name one, are shows favoured for. Angel had its comedic episodes, but the over arching themes were of the dark fight against darkness, being forced into positions where the right path isn't always visible and the seeking of salvation. This show was brilliant, and though it has carried on in comics, it will be sorely missed.",9,2013
"Are you one of those who loved Buffy but is not sure to watch this spin off with Angel? Well, let me put you on ease. It's worth to watch. It's got a different tone then Buffy. It's darker, more serious and again much darker. The first season is like with Bufyy a slow starter. But with the second season it started to find its way. It can, like with Buffy feel a little b but admit it, thats why why we love it. Mostly it can feel that because of the low budget and that the casting is not always god. But the scripts is often fantastic, especially the ones written by Joss Whedon. So stick with it and you will see some great episode in season three, four and five.",9,2013
"In my opinion, Angel is the best show ever.  It has everything I could ever want.  It has brilliant acting, especially from Boreanaz and Hallet. Every other actor plays their roles excellently as well, but Boreanaz switching from Angel to Angelus and also his ability to portray the child within is truly amazing. The great variety and creativity in the demons and other foes that Angel and Friends face always keeps me on my toes.  The makeup is excellent by TV series standards and the battles are great. The best part is the character development and interaction.  The characters interact just as I would expect and it is frequently humorous.",10,2004
"I fell in love with this series 5 years ago and it has never disappointed me. The storylines are intelligent and amazing. The acting is truly excellent which often is rare for a TV-series. This and ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" are my favorite TV-series and will always be close to my heart. I collect the seasons on DVD and so far they're the best things I own and I never get tired of watching the magic the actors and writers have created. My heart broke when I heard the news of the WB cancelling the series. It's such a waste of great talent. I will however happily continue to follow the cast and crew's careers. A big thank you to everyone that has been involved in the making of ""Angel""! Five amazing years that will last forever...",10,2004

"Spongebob Squarepants used to be Nikelodeaen's signature series. All the characters were good and the plot lines had meaning, and the show had talent. Nickelodean said in 1999 (when the show was created) that they would do three seasons and then do the movie. and that was it. until after the movie in 2004 the show boomed with popularity. so nickelodeon renewed the show for a forth season. After the movie, series creator and creative writer Stepen Hillenburg basically left the show and Paul Tibbit basically took over everything. This is when the show started going down hill. Then more rookie writers were hired and gave the plot lines dry, stupid humor. Everything that the first three seasons and the movie had set in stone was then defied and questioned in the past three seasons. all the characters have just became stupid. Spongebob has become high-pitched and annoying. Patrick is just oblivious to anything, now. Sandy is too smart and is overused. Mr. Krabs has become TOO cheap and his cheapness has been reused in too many episodes. Squidward has become too sarcastic and obsessed with himself. TOO many plot lines involving Plankton trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Spongebob has just become a whiny baby. If people thought he was gay when he came out, they should look at him now! It isn't funny any more. All of the plot lines are extremely predictable.(Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, Mr. Krabs pinches a penny, Spongebob cries.) Nickelodeon is just bleeding this show dry, such as what FOX is doing with the Simpson's. They know people will continue watching it and they will keep on bringing in the MONEY. They will sponge off of this show for as long as they can.(pun intended) The show used to be for adults and kids alike, now it should be put on Nick Jr with Dora and Deiago. I would have given this show a ten star rating for seasons 1-3 and the movie. Now a one. I 100% recommend seasons 1-3 and the movie(especially season 1) Spongebob used to be the Coupe De Ville of Nickelodean, know it's just like the rest of the shows nick is limping out to the barn with.(Mighty B, Penguins of Madagascar, Back at the Baryard.)",1,2010
I HATE the new Nickelodeon. Especially the new SpongeBob. It went from awesome to atrocious. I want to kill every writer who worked on it. ,1,2013
"It pains me to give Spongebob Squarepants a 1 because I used to watch it all the time as a kid! When I was growing up the episodes were great! It was witty, fun, and quirky humor. I'm eighteen now and the loved show that I grew up with is gone now. I watched the show with my niece a few times recently and I was shocked! The episodes are truly disgusting. The scenarios were so weird, gross, and outright inappropriate for young kids to watch. I really could not believe that it was on for Saturday morning cartoons! The new spongebob episodes should be on Adult Swim. I am absolutely appalled with how much this show has changed. I don't know if less effort is being put in Ir if they are trying to cater to a new audience, but I know that I wouldn't let my children (if I had any) watch the recent episodes of this show.",1,2013
"I can recall back when I was a wee lad about five years old when this show came out. And I thought it was a pretty good show. It was funny and kept me interested for a very long time Judging by the 8.2 rating of this show, most people agree.",5,2009
"This show used to be great and have great characters. USED TO. Nowadays this show used way to much filler to stall having to write because the new writers ARE DEMENTED they think Mr. Krabs driving plankton to SUICIDE is funny. Plankton straight up said he was waiting to be run over by a bus because he was constantly being tormented by Mr. Krabs. The new writers think gross out humor is funny. Squidward is the ONLY semi- likable character. Since the towns people are two faced, hypocritical, asshole, bullies who always do terrible things to the main characters for no apparent reason. Sponge bob should have ended with the movie so Nick wouldn't play this LITERALLY 12 times a day. Squidward is tortures mercilessly for doing nothing wrong in almost every episode. And in little yellow book Squidward and THE TOWNSPEOPLE read sponge bobs diary when Pat- Prick makes fun of sponge bob and bullies him while the towns people laugh (weren't these two friends at one point?). Then sponge Bob runs away crying and the towns people blame Squidward and claim they didn't know it was sponge bobs diary? WTF?! First of all the bullies, i mean towns people were making fun of sponge bob because of the diary so how did they not know? Then at the end Squidward gets tortures and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS to the townspeople. This episode is just one of many example with messed up morals and predictable endings.",1,2014
"When ""Spongebob Squarepants"" first started, I was one of those who watched it religiously. I absolutely loved it, and thought it was the best animated show on Nickelodean. I loved the fact it was funny, creative and original. It was vibrantly animated, with lavish colouring and convincing character features. The theme tune, what can I say? Probably the catchiest theme tune out of the shows airing on Nicolodean now. The writing was witty, funny and even intelligent, and the characters were endearing, from Spongebob himself, cynical Squidward, Eugene H. Karbs and the hilarious Patrick. And the voice acting was well done.",7,2010
"This show has to be one of the greatest shows of all time, if your not counting seasons 6-9, I know most people say either seasons 1-3 were the only good ones or 1-3 were amazing 4-5 were OK, but I think season 5 was good it might just be nostalgia talking but there were definitely good episodes in seasons 4-5.",8,2016
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frazer) leads the beautiful Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) to Hamunaptra (The City of the Dead) where reading from a book brings Imhotep (Pharaoh Seti I's High Priest) back to life.,8,2005
"""The Mummy"" is an adventurous yarn in the vein of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a lot of fun, very charming, and never tries to be more than what it is. What is it? An entertaining summer flick which is not only worth seeing, but perhaps even owning. It's one of those fun movies you can return to over and over again and never grow tired of doing so.",8,2003
"Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.",9,1999
"This is one film that caught my imagination like very few other Hollywood action films I have seen before.Yes,on the face of it,this is another sci-fi action adventure,a surefire winning card for Hollywood -what's so special about that ?Oh yes,there is !To begin with,there is the scenery at the beginning of the film that completely blows you away,making you feel that this movie could be something above what you had expected.And you are not wrong.The first surprise is Brendan Fraser as the American soldier Rick O'Connell, who accidentally stumbles upon Hamunaptra,the city of the dead,where the wealth of Egypt's greatest emperor Seti the First is buried.After seeing him in ""Airheads "" ,""Dudley Do-Right "" and "" ""George Of The Jungle"",I was very very impressed-this is one actor who can do both comedy and action and look good doing it too !Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz ,playing Evelyn Carnahan,who teams up with him to find Hamunaptra.She looks great playing her role,and never allows herself to be upstaged by Fraser, matching his brawn with her ever-alive intellect and quick thinking.Kevin J.O'Connor who plays the double-crossing Beni is a very new kind of villain,looking evil and ridiculous at the same time.But when the resurrected high priest Imhotep( played by Arnold Vosloo)makes his appearance in the form of ""The Mummy"", everything else becomes secondary.This is CGI at its ultimate best,and precisely why the film is so unusually absorbing .The horror and threat surrounding the curse of the mummy becomes a concern not only for the protagonists in the film but also for the audience-how will they kill something this scary and powerful?, they ask themselves. .The special effects apart from the mummy are also a treat to watch,and keep you glued to your seat.The element that makes this film not only scary but also enjoyable is the dialog.Almost every member of the large cast has a one-liner that will make you laugh in spite of the sinister atmosphere surrounding the story.The script never allows one second of screen-time to be wasted, ideally combining action with fantasy and humor,creating a movie that I consider a classic.Director Stephen Sommers has delivered a film that is bound to stand the test of time,and is definitely one of my favorites.",9,2005
"In the 1990's, a stream of remakes came out after the universal horror films with the monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), The Wolf Man(Wolf) and now The Mummy made after the same title. The original stared Boris Karloff and is truly a haunting movie. Despite the fact that slow moving mummies are not as scary of a villain, Boris brought in an incredible eerie performance that is so memorable that made mummies scary. How could we update the story to make mummies more terrifying to a newer audience? Make them faster? Make them smarter? How much they could control? How dangerous they truly are? They put a bunch of CGI into the film but somehow despite it being over the top at times, the story is what makes The Mummy into a great remake and respects the original making the mummy scary again.",8,2003
"The Mummy is the best mummy movie ever to be made. This movie will blow your mind by its action, romance, adventure and music score. I loved The Mummy because it's one of those roller coaster rides were you just jump on and never let go. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 mummy which starred Boris Karloff who played imhotep. The Mummy is about an expedition of treasure seeking explorers in the Sahara desert in 1925. They stumble upon an ancient tomb, the hunters without knowing set loose a 3,000 year-old inheritance of terror, which is personified in the vengeful reincarnation of an Egyptian priest who had been sentenced to an infinity as one of the living dead. I love watching this movie in 1999 at the big screen. This movie made me love Egypt a lot. I guarantee this movie a classic. Do not compare this with the 1932 movie.  Thanks to director Stephen Sommers which he did a wonderful job on this fantastic film. If you want to see this movie do not watch the 1932 one watch the 1999 one because it will blow you away. Last things to wrap this up Spectacular special effects, Roller coaster adventure, Funny moments, Out of the world music score, Superb acting and wonderful cast. This movie is a 10/10 stars.",10,2003
"First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing ""The Mummy"" because of it's ""weak plot"" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!",10,2008
"Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff's Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo's Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.",8,1999
"It seems like a long time ago when this came out, but I remember it being the first DVD I had ever bought sight unseen, meaning I had never seen the film in the theater. I was pleased. I got what I had hoped for: a fun, special-effects extravaganza. ",8,2006
"I will have to say that ""Mummy"" was an action adventure film in the spirit of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I know there have been other attempts over the years, but ""The Mummy"" comes the closest to hitting the mark.",9,2012
"The Mummy is a great summer adventure for nonstop thrills and kicks. It has a lot of humour; memorable comedic performances (Brendan Fraser), fantastic settings and surprisingly striking CGI for 1999. There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.",8,2006
"Brendan Fraser may well have established himself as the John Wayne of his day with his thrilling performance here.No one can take the place of the Duke of course,but Fraser approached his character with just the right amount of swagger,wit,and charm.This take on an often told story has all the charm of the old Saturday matinee's of years gone by,and all the thrills of the Raiders of the Lost Ark series.Excellent casting,with standout performances from everyone, particularly Arnold Vosloo,Fraser,and Oded Fehr.Highly recommended.",8,2002
"An excellent film, regardless of it's historical accuracy. I watched it today and really enjoyed it. I seriously do recommend you watch it.",10,2010
This film is definitely one of my favourites.,10,2008
"OK, hands down this movie is just awesome...Probably the best mummy movie.",10,2008
"The title speaks for itself.This is arguably the greatest mummy movie ever made(well next to The Mummy Returns).You ask why is this the best one?Its the best one because it has a great story,good acting,beautiful sites at how it really was in acient egypt and some of the greatest visual effects ever seen by the human eye!Everything in The Mummy is fantastic!",10,2001
If you are looking for some lighthearted tongue in cheek comedy with a touch of excitement and great effects.... look no further this is it!!,10,2004
"This is a perfect film to all adventure fans. Thanks to Stephen for the great adventure movie. This film has an interesting story and great ideas that help to tell it. When you mix excellent work such as Stephen's directing, Jerry's awesome music, cool ILM's effects, perfect make-up, plus a good story, exotic locations and ancient Egyptian time, subtle humor you get a movie that does not need anything else. I really like Stephen's creativity and the way he freely expresses his ideas. I am waiting for another good project from Stephen. By being a visual effects artist I can say just I wish I was a member of its effects team. Good job !!!",10,2006
"The Mummy (1999) is my favorite true nonstop action epic movie!!! Filled with dazzling visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling. It was the second movie i went to see in the theaters in 1999 with my mom as a kid. I was just a teen than I have enjoyed this movie a lot. The first movie in 1999 I went to see in theaters was The Matrix (1999) with also my mom and I have enjoyed both of this movie. Every time I am watching it, I still enjoy it! I had no idea it was a remake of 1932 film The Mummy. I never watched movies from 1938. There were spawned 2 sequels and one prequel/spin-off film. I love and I like both of the sequels on their own way and I hate the prequel/spin-off film. ""The Mummy"" (1999) was one of the finest Fantasy action adventures of all time. For the Mummy, achieving that level of serio-comic entertainment was unprecedented, and I still do not think it has been duplicated. All the witty dialogue, near perfect script, Dr. Bey... This was a very adult movie, but also for children too, and therefore accessible at different levels. The comments by Ebert, and co. were silly at best, as we have an example of critics turning up their nose at a great film, just to be 'in', be smiled upon by the academy, etc. It was therefore a poor review, a poor appraisal by the twain: this time you should not have used them. ",10,2015
"The Mummy is an action-adventure film in the vein of classics such as Raiders of The Last Ark and The Goonies. It is a movie filled with moments scary enough to make your skin crawl, but in equal amounts moments that JUST make your heart warm. The chemistry between the cast is amazing, especially between the hunky leading actor Brendan Fraser and the ever beautiful Rachel Weisz, who both give an outstanding performance that carries the movie forward as an adventure film with a lot of heart for the whole family. ",10,2015
"So before I begin this rather short review I will say this, don't watch this movie with Indiana Jones in mind as it has been compared in the past...its just simply not its a ""Fun"" adventure in Egypt",9,2015
The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.,8,2010
"The surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.",10,2005
"The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant",10,2000
"This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.",9,1999
"The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days.  In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.",10,1999
"This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.",10,1999
"This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.",9,2006
"...but I had to watch this one again, right afterward, because I needed to go back and watch for clues. Honestly, and I won't give away the 'ah ha!' moment, but I knew that he was... well, you know, what he was. What I didn't get was how that was possible, or how the interaction with the others that I saw... so I had to go back and watch the movie AGAIN, just to make sure there were no errors in the filming of it. Sure enough, I found none that I could call an error, and was totally blown away with how this was filmed. I am a writer, and I also adapt novels for scripts, and when something like this comes along, that something that just totally grabs me and says, ""This is something special... this is not the ordinary..."" well, I am impressed. I aspire to write something that can really AH HA! someone in this way. I recommend the movie, highly.",9,2008
"""I see Dead People!""  Sixth Sense is well worth the ticket price.  It's a tight story and the acting is outstanding.  There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)",8,1999
"M. Night Shyamalan has created something that will not, can not be outdone. This film is so simple, yet so complex. It is so out there, yet one gets a strange feeling from the film because it seems so real. The acting is amazing. Bruce Willis has never been better. Toni Collette is at the top of her game. Haley Joel Osment was robbed at the Academy Awards, because he gave in this film the single best child performance and one of the greatest performances of all time (adult or child) in this movie. The only child performances that rival his in this movie are Osment's other performances. And let's not forget Olivia Williams who had perhaps the hardest time since she had to play the part that can be viewed on two very different levels. *hint hint* Perfect.",10,2007
"A perfect balance. Sad, but not self-pitying. Triumphant, but not cheesy. Frightening, but never grotesque. Shocking, but not gimmicky. Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.",10,2006
"I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. (The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) ""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? ""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.",8,2008
"Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is a young boy troubled by an affliction, he can see the dead all around him, for much of the time and he is labelled a freak by everyone except his mother. Haley Joel Osment puts in such a fine performance in this role, it is hard to believe he is a child.",10,2005
"The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that once you've seen it the first time, you're never going to be able to watch it the same way again, due to the gasp-worthy twist near the end. So, in that sense, it's sort of a one-time deal. I still remember how I actually did gasp, and feel this jolt of shock go through me, when watching it at the cinema and realising the truth of the situation. And while I can never recapture that feeling when watching this film again, I do still get a lot out of it while re-watching.",10,2013
Cole is keeping a secret from his psychologist Malcolm. This secret is huge and it has to do with more than just mood issues and schizophrenia. Over the course of the movie Cole learns to trust Malcolm and tells him the secret but there is more to this secret than Malcolm really understands.,8,2007
The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.,10,2007
"Upon first watch of The Sixth Sense, I was hooked and shocked at the same time. I expected a complete horror story, mixed with the usual gore and stomach-churning scenes we ordinarily witness in other movies with a similar theme. The Sixth Sense is anything but. It details the emotional aspects of love and devotion, as well as having to cope with being an outsider.",9,2006
"This is a must see film, I'm a great fan of thriller/horror films and this is by far the best. the acting is superb the storyline is superb the horror is awesome!!! this film has the best twist ever anyone who says they knew that the film would end like that is a liar!!!the acting of Haley Joel Osment is incredible he was also brilliant in AI. this is not one of those films that drags on or that is forgettable like a lot of other thriller/horror films (the grudge, dark water)your remember this one forever!!!!",10,2005
***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***,9,2002
"Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.",9,1999
"Stanley Kubrick was tempted to do ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in 1970, but Christianne, his wife, felt that her marriage could be in jeopardy, so she implored him not to do it... But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" came to be after all, the last temptation of Kubrick...",8,1999
"I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.",10,1999
"I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say ""I'm at least half a bum."" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.",10,2005
"I admit that I'm part of the Kubrick cult(people that follow his movies like a religion), and I was first in line to see this movie.  Being a huge movie fan I've seen a wide variety of movies, and have walked away from them with a wide variety of emotions.  This was the first movie to put me in a trance, or dream, like state.  The way the movie was shot, lighted, and so on gave the feel of a dream (to me at least).  I believe that this feel is just what was needed and what Kubrick wanted.  Everyone has to admit to thinking about the dark side of sex, and I believe that in this movie we see that a person can explore the buried desires of their sexual id and still come away a good person.",10,1999
"The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others.  Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.",9,1999
"There is no denying that Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.  He may not have made many films, but every single one of them is a masterpiece.  That is not something that can be said about many other directors.  He is a true artist.  And it is because of that word, ""art"", that his work is often misunderstood.  Rather than create films which reveal everything that the audience needs to know through the dialogue or the action, Kubrick layers his films with meaning.  He does this through all aspects of the film.. the music, the images, the dialogue, and expressions. And by the end of the film, nothing is left clear, because he wants you to think about what you have seen, and come up with your own meaning for the film.  The problem with this is that most people don't go to see films to think, they just want to see the next ""Armageddon"" or ""Waterboy"".  So, if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" fails at the box-office, or is badly criticized by movie-goers, it has nothing to do with the film itself, but is more reflective of the movie-goers, and their inability to see further than what is presented to them on the screen.  Life experience and a philosophical mind is also required to fully understand and enjoy this film.  If you have ever thought of what role sex plays in your relationship, and what love and commitment really mean, you will understand this film.  If you have ever considered what the difference between love and sex is, you will understand this film.  If you have ever truly felt lust, you will understand this film.  Be prepared to think.",9,1999
"After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out.  So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype?  For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.",10,1999
"Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways. ",10,2009
"I admire the work of Stanley Kubrick very much.  All his films remain in my mind with a vitality far beyond most of the other work I see, even though the details of the films are often boring or inscrutable.",9,1999
"And so the last chapter of the Kubrick enigma is written. Trouble is, the real enigma is why anyone thought there was one to start with.",1,1999
"By writing this, I am hoping that I will save people a lot of time and money.  Last night I went with a friend to see Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece.  Supposedly, he had wanted to make this film for twenty-seven years, and spent sixty-seven weeks shooting it, an incredible amount of time for a commercial film.  Being the sort of mug film buff that I am, I thought that I should go to see a film made by an acknowledged master, who had  spent so much time getting it just right.",1,1999
"This is one of my favourite films. I love the tense and psychological atmosphere throughout and every scene was fascinating in its own way. This film was not meant to be particularly sexy as many viewers were expecting. Kubrick would not have allowed it to be marketed in such a way. Many of the characters Bill meets are purely symbolic so people should not complain that they are implausible or caricatured. I would not argue with people who complain of the film's slow pace but it didn't bother me personally. Brief outline: The first part of the film sets the scene and introduces the main characters: Bill and Alice, Nick Nightingale and Ziegler. Bill and Alice's marital situation becomes clear and then her confession sets off a chain of events forming the main subject of the film. Bill has several near sexual encounters with various strangers before Nightingale points him to the mysterious masked orgy at the mansion. I found this to be one of the most sinister and haunting scenes in movie history. Bill discovers that this society is extremely private and that intruders are dealt with severely. He is spared after a woman at the orgy appears to sacrifice herself.",10,2005
"I remember when Kubrick passed away. I read it in the morning newspaper, and was struck with deep sadness I couldn't explain. Mind you, I was not even 12 years old at the time and had barely seen any of his films. ",8,2013
"Stanley Kubrick's final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It's no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren't merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford's sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film's center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters' trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick's favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it's inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man's dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick's contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick's final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick's more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that 'Observancy is a dying art' and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it's easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick's musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick's films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.",10,2012
"Ok if you liked it that's great and I'm glad you didn't waste your money. I found this film to be boring, badly acted and annoying. Maybe if you find all that ""sexual titilation"" stuff exciting then perhaps I could understand it but it seemed pretty tame to me. Definately a thumbs down.",1,2003
This was one of the longest movie viewing experiences I had ever had. I don't know how many times I looked at my watch to see if it was almost over. Through three hours of film I must have blinked during the unveiling of the plot. At the end you wonder what they were making a big deal about all through the movie. It made no sense to me. It was the first Kubrick film I had seen and will undoubtedly be the last one I will watch. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman looked as lost acting in this movie as I was watching it. I think many of the scenes were just thrown in for shock value.,1,1999
This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  It was definitely the worst Kubrick film.,1,2000
"I saw this movie in a popular Los Angeles cinema on its opening day.  I've never heard more yawning, himming and hawning, and shifting in theater seats like I heard during this movie.  And there's good reason:  this movie was bad.",1,1999
"I can't remember the last time I had to sit through something so dull and tedious.  The dialogue was banal and the plot was non-existent.  Sure, Tom Cruise is one of the cutest guys on the planet, and Nicole Kidman has a beautiful body, but I'm afraid that doesn't warrant sitting through three hours of this drivel. I see movies 3 or 4 times per week and it is extremely rare that I flat-out hate any, but I must be totally missing the Stanley Kubrick ""vision"" that everyone else is raving about.",1,1999
"Don't get me wrong, I like Kubrick.  Clockwork Orange is one of the best movies ever made, Full Metal Jacket is awesome, the Shining is great too. Unfortunately, this is about as bad as 2001: A Space Odyssey.",1,2003
"I give ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a rating of AWFUL.  I believe this is the worst film I have ever seen. It was dull.  It had far too much nudity.  It had a bad script.  I wonder why stars such as Cruise and  Kidman agreed to act in it.  The other film starring Cruise and Kidman, ""Far and Away"", was a much better film.  Anyone agree?",1,2001
"I regret my decision to stick with this movie beyond its slow beginning. The characters' motivation was completely irrational, unbelievable and left me unsympathetic with everyone shown.  This movie could have been a psychological thriller, or a steamy sexual adventure.  Instead it's a baffling depiction of random actions by people we just don't care about. Kubrick has produced some masterworks, but it's an error to add this film to that list.",1,1999
"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you.",10,1999
"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.",10,2000
"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.",10,2000
THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****,10,2000
"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves.",10,2000
This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.,10,2001
"Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful.",10,2000
"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5",8,2001
"I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.",10,1999
"i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for Tom Hanks but as movie goes through i cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one.",10,2009
"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)",10,2012
GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...,10,2012
"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.",10,2010
I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. ,10,2009
"In every way, this is a wonderful film and IMO deserves a rare 10/10 because it's hard personally for me to see how it could have been made any better. Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.",10,2011
This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.,10,2011
"The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****",9,2009

The Green Mile.... Yet another movie which made me cry.,10,2013
"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.",10,2013
***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****** ,6,2002
"This show has always been ignored, or passed over by some old Simpson's fans, simply because it isn't the Simpsons. ",10,2013
The television series Futurama is nothing short of brilliant and in my opinion is the best television series ever. I personally do not actually like science fiction movies or series aside from this one show which i give an exception too.,10,2008
"Now that is not to say the Simpsons is bad or anything, I really like it, but it has jumped the shark for a few years now. Futurama is everything I love an animated series to be, funny, original and witty. I seriously don't know where to begin praising the show. Well for one thing the animation is amazing. The characters are really well drawn, the backgrounds are audacious and the visual effects are eye-popping. And the music is brilliant, it is cleverly composed with some funky songs featuring such as ""Conga"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and the theme tune is definitely memorable. The writing is outstanding, the comedy works brilliantly and the more touching and subtle parts work just as well. The episode ideas springing from a brilliant concept are really original and fun, and the pacing is great. And the characters with the help of a truly talented voice cast are really unique and endearing, especially Fry, Bender and Zoidberg, and Leela is a feisty and headstrong character that I related to immediately. Overall, a truly wonderful show, with all the fun and originality that are lacking in the later episodes of the Simpsons. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10,2010
Futurama is one of my all time favorite cartoon series. Never gets old. This show is so smart and funny. Why FOX ever canceled this show is beyond me.,10,2008
"This marvelous animation, from the creator of my all time favourite motion picture, The Simpsons, uses a subtle integration of cgi graphics with a more flashy version of Groenings style of animation to produce half hours of non stop gags (quite intelligent in some cases) and fun adventure. The pop culture references so great in The Simpsons only go farther and wider here in this story of Fry, a pizza delivery boy sent through suspended animation to the year 3000 from the year 1999.",10,2007
"Fry is normal pizza delivery boy of the year 1999 with a lousy job and his girlfriend had just dumped him for a better man. He has nothing to live for when he accidentally gets frozen in science lab on 31st of Decemeber 1999 and wakes up in the year 3000. He finds his great-great-...-great grandson, a mad old scientist, and works, that's funny, as a delivery boy, but this time he delivers different stuff with a space ship in outer space. His team at work are his best friends: Leela - a cyclopean human mutant, Bender - probably the most complex character, a bender robot, full of vices like drinking problems or stealing, doctor Zoidberg - a crustacean human doctor (if you would ask me, he is the funniest), Amy - a Chinese girl born on Mars and heir of one hemisphere of the planet, and Hermes - a Jamaican bureaucrat (that's funny, bureaucracy continues to extend even more in the 31st century).",10,2007
"Futurama is an absolutely hilarious show. The jokes are great and the characters are unique. Fry's stupidity is hilarious. Bender is great. The professor says some really funny stuff, especially the insults he comes up with. The whole show is an entertaining, comic masterpiece. I was actually pretty surprised at how good the last season was. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm deeply saddened that this show is canceled.. Again!! It's better than a couple of the adult animated series that are still running on Sunday nights. The last season was so funny that it made us even more confused that it's being canceled. How is this happening when some other terrible junk is still on the air?? It's a brilliant show. The creators did an excellent job and I'd love to thank them for this. It's worth watching again and again! I will miss seeing new episodes.",10,2014
"As most of us know, Futurama is a really, really funny show, and every character has something special about them. There is nothing wrong with this show at all! I don't see any flaws, and I don't care if there are any. This is a show with a truly touching and hilarious story line.",10,2010
"I am a fan of Family Guy, at least for the first 3 1/2 seasons. What they are doing now is just completely opposite of what Futurama has done in all of its seasons. This series has one thing that most shows nowadays don't really have anymore. Consistency. Normally in a series, there's quite a few episodes that I wouldn't want to watch. Futurama, however, is the rare series that I wouldn't mind watching any episode at any time.",10,2007
Well 2 days ago making a review for the Futurama movie I realized I have not put a review down for the show that started it all. The show is about Fry a 21 year old pizza delivery boy who always wanted to be an astronaut and when he accidentally gets himself chrogenically frozen and wakes up in the year 3000. The show is hilarious from the start of the first episode till the end of the last. I think that if you love The Simpsons then you will definitely like Futurama as Matt Groening has done a brilliant job changing from series to series which is a very difficult thing to do. Overall the show is a must watch for everyone and despite the fact the idiots a Fox canceled it after 72 episodes. I rate this 97%.,10,2007
"Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.",10,2004
"This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.",10,2000
"I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.",10,2000
"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.",10,2000
American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.,10,2000
"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.",10,2001
Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).,10,2003
"This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.",10,1999
"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.",10,2001
"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?",10,1999
"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.",10,2007
"This is a profound movie that examines ordinary people.  For all their flaws people are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of the fabric of this film.  I liked that it was revealed at the start of the film that Lester would soon meet his demise.  And I also liked at the ending, the identity of the person who took his life didn't really matter, just the sadness of the loss of his life.  'Look Closer' was the theme of this movie and Lester even had this motto in his cubical.  Kevin assumed the persona of Lester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  Bening inhabited Carolyn in much the same way.  Which one of us hasn't experienced the disillusionment of our teenage years, only to later re-experienced it again through our children.  And like Carolyn, who among us has not been intensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  That one scene was amazing, it looked so real that it transcended acting.  And can a movie actually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbing discussion, but real change in it's audience?  Perhaps.  But if this is true, then that movie would be American Beauty.  And for those who feel this movie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  To them I say, ""Never underestimate the power of denial.""  A ten, of course.",10,1999
"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie.",10,2007
I HATED this movie. I hated everything about it.,1,2006
"Someone put it best in one of the reviews I read earlier: This movie is exactly the result of people trying to make a so-called art movie and still win the best picture oscar. American Beauty shamelessly trots out every imaginable convention of what an art movie is and then glosses it over with cute shooting, a relatively short run time and face pace. It says virtually nothing about any of the supposedly unusual or profound content that ostensibly is its subject matter. Apparently issues of would-be gravity making cameo apperaances constitutes a profound social comment. It is a great jumble of clichés (spoilers here maybe): The neurotic wife, the homophobic army man (That he turns out to be gay is not of any consequence since anything serious is not given attention in the film, it is a cute afterthought. Though it would be a serious point if this movie had anything to do with reality)The white collar dick with a mid-life crisis, the artist who sees beauty where no one else can, the pretending promiscuous cheerleader. Are there any characters that aren't stock? I cant believe anyone commented that this is in any way realistic. This is not a portrayal of of American life. In reality the teenager with an abusive psychotic homicidal father does not have 40,000$ and cannot conveniently run away to his friends in NYC. The middle-aged man unjustly fired from his job does not conveniently have information he can use to blackmail his bosses for 60,000$ and live happily ever after. Living in a duplex as a teenager is nothing resembling duress; that would be living on less that one U.S. dollar a day as millions of people do. This could easily qualify as propaganda: When you are rich you dont have to worry, your problem is only that you are not looking ""beneath the surface"" to see the true hedonistic beauty that life is really made of. Well I agree that this beauty does exist. Unfortunately though I am going to burst the bubble of one of the supposedly most profound scenes in the movie: The plastic bag. Look closer, they say, and you will see the beauty in reality. Yes! but this is not reality! Plastic Bags do not blow in circles for 15 minutes. That scene could practically never have occurred in nature; Im sorry I did look closer and it was so obviously being manipulated off camera that it was absurd. That sums up the movie fairly: Look at what we call beauty, we say it is natural but we are really manipulating it. If wind machines (or whatever they are technically called) are really the wind then this movie is really based in reality. Sam Mendes and Alan (whatever his last name is, the writer) are daring the viewer to be as dumb and gullible as they hope they can be. And to my amazement they succeed. If we throw together a whole bunch of artistic clichés and it doesnt make sense to you then you are dumb. Anyone who has a modicum of sanity and any concept of criticism has seen this movie as the charade it is and I stand firmly in their camp. I literally exclaimed out loud (though I was by myself) ""What the F**k??!!"" at the beginning when Kevin Spacey says ""In a way I am already dying (paraphrased)"". It is the zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity.",1,2001
"Kevin Spacey is a genius, or at least a veritable magician.  A couple of the folks with whom I saw ""American Beauty"" said afterwards: ""It was great - Spacey was incredible.""  His performance, it seems, is enough to have convinced people that they had just watched a decent movie, even though there is little else to recommend the film.  The other significant plus is the advertising campaign - marketing it as ""a funny drama"" and ""a moving comedy"" is an ingenious way of disguising the fact that it is neither. Since there are only two or three really good laughs in the piece it isn't really funny enough to be a comedy (but since it's written by someone who used to work on ""Cybill"", that's hardly a surprise) and since it only gets vaguely dramatic towards the end, it doesn't maintain the atmosphere of a ""drama"".  But the audience happily accepts this schizophrenic mess because the adverts told them to.  The adverts also told them to ""Look closer"". Again, this is a tip-top marketing ploy, since it implies hidden depth, significance and meaning, without the content actually being there.  The average audience member is going to think ""Wow, that plastic bag blowing around must be really poignant, because this is a DEEP movie.""  Heaven forbid that they should actually think for themselves.  Look closer, indeed.",1,2000
"I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.",6,2002
"Now, let me see if I've gotten this straight: ""Saving Private Ryan"", an epic tale of honor, glory, and sacrifice set against the backdrop of what was possibly the most important single day of the Twentieth Century, was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.",1,2000
"This piece of sitcommy, cliche-ridden claptrap is just smart enough on its surface for the middlebrow Academy to pimp it for a Best Picture Oscar. But anyone with half a brain will see through this tired male fantasy pretty soon. Mendes shows us a Edward Scissorhands-type of suburbia: perfect lawns, identical homes, etc... We are expected to know (since we've seen ES, Ice Storm, Happiness, Serial Mom, etc.) that these people must lead shallow, empty lives - look where they live! And... they do! This is just the first of many obvious themes that we have seen so many times before. And we haven't even reached Spacey's character's midlife crisis yet. (Surprise! He falls in sexual lust with a gorgeous high-school blonde. Sooooo subversive! Look closer, and you'll find even more cliches.) Spacey's wife is, predictably, a self-centered shrew who won't satisfy him sexually but cooks delicious nutritious dinners and sells (surprise) real estate. His daughter is a misfit (wow!) with whom he can't connect. The new kid on the block (of course there is one) is a weird, sensitive (but handsome) loner type (shocker) who (believe it or not) falls for Spacey's moody daughter. Don;t even ask about the gay neighbors. Mendes does nothing but condescend to his characters, his setting, and above all, the audience. Positives: Thora Birch is terrific and lovely; Mena Suvari is breathtakingly beautiful, and the plastic bag sequence is affecting. Pretentious c***.",1,1999
"American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.",10,2004
"While it received generally positive reviews upon its release, and captured the imaginations of an entire generation of younglings, The Phantom Menace has garnered an almost toxic reputation on the internet in the years since. Sure, it's not a perfectly executed film, and yes, there are more than a few dopey decisions, but the sheer spectacle and sense of fun in Star Wars: Episode I cannot be denied. George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire.",9,2015
"I loved this movie as a kid. I still love it at age 21. Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you.",9,2015
"Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.",5,2005
"I recently rewatched everything Star Wars including this, the Clone Wars cartoons etc. In preparation for seeing The Force Awakens.",8,2015
This movie begins the back story of anakin skywalker and obi wan (amongst other characters).,9,2015
WARNING: CONTAINS A SPOILER WHICH EXPLAINS THE TITLE!,9,2000
"After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas's story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the ""Phantom Menace"" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!",9,2001
"I disagree completely with all the people, who criticize the film, because there's nothing really bad in it. George Lucas and  all of the others worked very hard on TPM, and it shows. After seeing the film a couple of times, I am more and more amazed, how good the script is. GL really thought all details through to make an entertaining experience, and there ARE NO PLOT HOLES. I know that a lot of people out there disagree with me on that, but all of the little problems a lot of people have with the plot can be explained with a little thought, and I believe that GL really thought everything through -- he just didn't tell us the whole story. What surprised me was the German dubbing -- it's really good, and sometimes even better than the original version (I've seen both). Unfortunately we all have to wait too long for the next two episodes...",9,1999
It's interesting how times change. It's very fashionable to hate this movie and give it one star (and no one calls anyone a troll) and it's very unfashionable at the moment to give TFA one star (and lots of people call you a troll).,9,2015
"This chapter in the Star Wars Sage is vastly underrated, and is always given the short end of the stick by the so-called Star Wars purists.",10,2006
"When I first rented this movie at my local DVD rental store, I didn't have high hopes for it at first. But that's only because at the time, I had virtually no interest in Star Wars at all. One day after watching a review of the films, I decided to give the movies a try, and see if they were worth all the fame they have. But little did I know that when I first hit 'play' on that DVD menu, i had taken my first step into a larger world.",2,2012
"What fun I had at this movie!  The whole experience, from the crowd cheering and excitement as the words ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the music, the opening scenes as Qui Gon and Obi Won battled the droids, to the escape of Queen Amidala, to the pod racing, to the unleashing of Darth Maul, to the climatic fight, etc., etc.!  This was a great time.  I hear some complain that it wasn't anything like the first Star Wars, A New Hope.  Well, of course not!  Had it been, everyone would have complained that all they did was try to recapture the magic of the first movie!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, any age, anywhere!",9,2000
"When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",10,2001
"This movie, the most hyped movie of all time, has been put under the microscope and looked at in a variety of different ways. It seems that everyone had prejudged the movie before it was even released, and then strutted about claiming that they told you that it would be that way. There was the die-hards, who were impossible to dissapoint. There were of course the disenchanted and the unimpressible, who probably would not had conceeded the movie was good no matter what. There were the people who acted as if this movie symbolized their disapproval of media hype itself, and by principle decided to dislike the film. Looking over the other comments I see the opposing viewpoints clearly. OK, the movie was overhyped, but what do you expect in 1999, the year of hype? I was four years old when the A New Hope came out, and of course, I loved it. I was four, and a science fiction epic can have its way with a boy of that age. I think many people in the 20-35 age group expected to have that same life changing event that happened to them twenty years ago this time around. That is the equivalent of going to Disney World for the first time since you were a kid and being let down: Did you expect the impact to be the same? Take the movie for what it is. OK, it isn't just any movie, but it behaved like one, with strong points and weak ones as well. First the strong points.",9,2000
The release of hardly any other movie was met with the same kind of anticipation and hype than the first chapter in the Star Wars Saga after sixteen years of absence: Episode I. ,9,2016
"Since this movie was way overhyped, It's no huge surprise why it has recieved so much negativity. But Let's be real now..On a George Lucas stand-point, he did his job to satisfy the STAR WARS fans with the saga's FIRST,  (I'll say that again)    THE FIRST!!!  Episode of the whole Star Wars Legacy.",9,2000
"It's kind of hard to review this because I don't see this as one movie, but as a chapter part of one larger story. The reason why I say this is cause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to be one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga. If you disagree with me about what I say the structure is, just send me a message or place a comment.",10,2011
"The story to SW1 is actually very detailed and interesting. Now I will admit the dialogue is not superb, but the story does flow and leaves viewers anticipating the next sequel. This movie is a backdrop - an introduction of the Star Wars Universe, the Republic, the Jedi, Other characters and the Trade Federation. This is not an easy task to accomplish - explaining to viewers where all the elements of the original trilogy come from. I think people were expecting this to be right up there with the first three, but forgot to realize that this movie is the beginning of the saga..... Viewers also complained about the complexity of the plot with all the politics....my thoughts are that we need to be informed of the fragile and crumbling centre of the republic in order to completely understand the birth of the Empire. But now that this has all been done, I believe that the action will kick into full swing with ""Attack of the Clones"" (Episode II) Check out the documentaries on the Official site.....especially ""trying to do my thing"" Take a look at our next Anakin.....I think we all will be pleasantly surprised with what the next movie has to offer. Anyway my rating for The Phantom Menace is a healthy 8.5/10.",10,2001
"I know it's fashionable to scorn the ""prequel"" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare ""Phantom Menace"" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.",10,2007
"I was excited to know that a Star Wars movie would be released during my time. TPM was worthy of being a Star Wars movie. George Lucas made a nice choice in the casting selections. The special effects and the computer animation added a nice touch to the movie. The aliens also contributed to the movie. If this movie had a fault, I'd say it was that it ended.",9,2000
"and this is coming from a huge fan of star wars BEFORE the prequels. These are all the same thing..cheesy dialogue? yup, the OT had that too...bad acting? I fail to see it...Music? Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous. These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are. For those who say he raped your childhood, well, I guess that sucks for you, but let those who aren't little babies enjoy these. Another solid addition to the Star Wars franchise. 9/10",10,2010
"Well, after waiting 16 years for his next installment,  George has given us ""The Phantom Menace"".  As a Star Wars fan I got what I expected - another chance to immerse myself in the Star Wars universe - a film whose sole purpose is essentially escapism.  But as a movie fan, and judging it as I would any other movie, I frankly feel mildly disappointed.  Any movie that's made can always be improved upon but I feel that this SHOULD have been better.  Firstly the good points :",7,1999
"As a devout fan of the whole Star Wars phenomenon, I become increasingly frustrated with comments on how this new Star Wars doesn't stand up to the originals.  For those who remember the originals, they were just as much filled with bad acting, poor dialogue, and flat characters.  The Star Wars movies are meant to be fun, nothing more.  and The Phantom Menace is just that.  Who can deny the excitement of the light-saber dueling, the thrill of the pod race, or the sheer beauty of the alien locations?  Too many people are expecting the saga's content to have matured along with them, but Lucas' heart is still where it was in 1977 (though perhaps notably more profit-oriented).",10,2001
"For 6 months I longed to watch Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and for 133 minutes I was absolutely blown away with how well the movie was put together.  I saw it on opening day of course, and I now understand why I have waited so long to write a review of it.  If I had written this review right after I watched the movie, I would have written a review influenced by the months and months of anticipation.  I feel now, after 17 months and countless 1000's of times watching all or some of the movie, I now feel that I can review this film free of influence.",8,2000
"I have just finished watching the Complete Series DVD collection of ""Freaks and Geeks,"" one of the best high school television series on televisions that, thanks to idiotic network executives who continue to make the decisions that make network television more and more unbearable to watch, have truly missed out on a gem. And, thanks to a healthy fan network, I was able to enjoy every bit of the series (as short as it was) on DVD.",8,2005
"This was a marvelously written and acted TV show. And, since TV is often a medium full of vacuous mind-numbing crap (reality TV, Jerry Springer, etc.), it's no wonder that this show bombed--it was just too good. It's really a shame, as I think the show would have appealed to people of all ages--kids as well as their parents.",10,2006
"The show's creative team seems to have an eye for the high school experience and their vision transcends the setting. Freaks and Geeks is set at a Michigan high school in 1980 and the opening shot of the series sets us up for who the show will be about. We track across a football practice and up to the bleachers where a player and cheerleader are discussing how they love each other so much, it's scary. We linger briefly on this generic moment before moving underneath the bleachers to real life and a conversation about Molly Hatchet and Led Zeppelin. These are the Freaks. Then come the Geeks. They are three boys quoting Caddyshack, are bullied for it, and then saved by a girl. It's through these freaks and these geeks that we will relive the high school experience. Sure the names of the groups change, their lingo and the bands they listen to, but everyone can relate to the horrors and beauties of high school and the relationships that reside there.",10,2006
"I'll make it short because most comments here will already tell you how great this show is in detail much better than I could and in adding a lenghty review I would only repeat much of the other reviews. Freaks and Geeks is a wonderful show with real characters the viewers can identify with and it tells school life as it was with all the humiliations, pain, angst, joy, discoveries, secrets...it's a very honest and low key show with a slow narrative but the stories and characters really grab you by the heart. The casting was incredible and the chemistry between the actors is something else. Especially the geek trio is awesome. Sams unanswered crush he has on cheerleader Cindy is something all Geeks of the world can relate to, as we all know nice guys finish last :-) I was fed up with all the models and pretty boys who follow these stupid, superficial, oversexed and manipulative dating&love story lines a long time ago already and only recently saw these episodes of Freaks and Geeks. And it was like a fresh breath of air! I didn't watch it from the beginning unfortunately and zapped in to ""We've got spirit"". Then came the scene when Todd thanked the team and the high school and then he thanked God, and I knew I was in for something special. Only I didn't know right then and there just how great of a show freaks and Geeks truly is! The fact that NBC stopped this series after one season only is a true testament to the sad state of television these days.",10,2006
NBC creates one of the best series to burn cathode particles into a screen...only to abandon it like one of those professionally choreographed orphans in Annie. Except this time Daddy Warbucks adopts all the children only to light their singing bus afire. Maybe NBC should join up with FOX.,10,2008
"Freaks and Geeks is quite possibly one of the best television shows of the last 20 years. Maybe even better. It's raw, real, full of laughs and pulls every heart string. I believe, wholeheartedly, that if this show was aired now, it was have a massive viewing audience. I think ten years ago, the public wasn't ready for it. Now that Judd Apatow has had some serious box office hits (Knocked Up, etc.) the public might be more receptive to F&G.",10,2008
"When I was in high school, the most popular TV show about people my age was Dawson's Creek. As someone who was on the outside looking in to the kind of teenagers this series featured, I avoided it because I thought it would be as incomprehensible as some of the lectures on C-SPAN. Before Freaks and Geeks, the supposed antithesis to shows like Dawson's Creek, came along, my first thought was that with a title like that and a tag line of ""what high school was like for the rest of us,"" it would be along the lines of the typical '80s teensploitation movie. Instead, we got a show that is intelligent, heartfelt, genuinely funny and - best of all - real. Instead of stereotypes, Freaks and Geeks gives us characters who seem so authentic that it is easy to mistake their names for the names of similar people we grew up with. I knew at least one dismissive, sarcastic man of few words like Ken, a constantly fighting couple like Daniel and Kim and was, ahem, knew an awkward, all-around geek like Bill. Despite focusing on the titular cliques, the show covers facets of high school life both in and out of the classroom that all students regardless of social standing encounter. These include romantic relationships that end before they begin, initial exposures to sex, drugs and alcohol and what could be the overarching theme of the series: how difficult it can be to discover who you are and where you belong. My favorite episode and the one where I feel the series hit its stride is ""Carded and Discarded,"" particularly for how it reveals the unfortunate fact that some high school friendships are merely confidence-building stepping stones to bigger and better things. Freaks and Geeks only lasted one season, but since its portrait of the high school experience is so complete, this is hardly a drawback. For this reason and for the show's hilarity, authenticity and that it never hits a false note, Freaks and Geeks deserves to be on a list of the best TV shows of all time.",10,2013
"This show is one of the best shows ever and probably the best one about teenagers.It is accurate - I really like the fact that there's no happy ending in every episode. Everything in life is not gonna be OK. The acting, the dialog, clothes are excellent, so are the songs played and characters have a lot of depth. ",10,2012
"I love this show, there really isn't anything to not like about this show (except that it ended so early!) My two favourite shows are Freaks and Geeks and The Simpsons, and they have the opposite problems. Freaks and Geeks ended WAY too early, I would have loved to see more. And The Simpsons has gone on for too long, it's been going downhill since season 20. I love all the characters on Freaks and Geeks. At the beginning of the show I didn't like Kim Kelly at all (SPOILER ALERT) but then she stops being such a jerk to Lindsay and they become friends. This is when I started to like Kim Kelly too. I think that every episode was better than the last. The episodes kept getting more funny and the story kept on getting more intense. This is why I really would have loved to see more. It really is a shame that it ended so early. Not only is the acting and story lines amazing, but this show also has the best soundtrack ever. It's just an awesome show all around. Judd Apatow and Paul Feig did an amazing job making this show! Anyways, if you haven't seen Freaks and Geeks I highly recommend it. Also, I recommend buying the DVD set. I bought it and it was worth every penny!",10,2012
I had read a lot about this show and was dying to see it. I have watched all 18 episodes 4 times over. The first time I saw it I did a marathon run and stayed awake until I'd watched the lot. It really is that good.,10,2011
"Just about perfect in every way. Just a real and authentic portrayal of teens that comes across as so genuine and funny. And I loved how the series followed different characters in each episode and fleshed them out. Kudos to all the actors, writers, directors and editors that participated in this series . . . from the leads to the smaller characters. So many talents seemed to really find their start with this series. In fact, re-watching the series this last year, I noticed Ben Foster in a really small role talking about ""Three's Company"" and he seemed almost in-recognizable . . . but he's so funny -- he commits so completely to his role. It's never overplayed for laughs, and I think that's what makes it so timeless and so great. ",10,2010

"I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     ",8,1999
"The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it.  There's not much of that restricting, suffocating ""logic"" stuff around, but ""American Pie"" is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.",7,1999
"Where do you start... from flutes to pies, this pioneer teen movie has it all. I'm pretty sure this was the first DVD I ever saw, back in 2000. I do remember owing $20 in late fees to blockbuster video for keeping it so long after it was due back. It was worth it! This has classic written all over it, I think it's safe to say that anyone that was involved with this movie has a great career now because of it. American pie has an absolute all star cast led by the Great Jason biggs Anyone who enjoys comedy, teen comedy must see this movie! honestly you need to watch more movies if you haven't sen this one!!!",10,2007
"Honestly ,I can't really understand how a trash movie like this one became such a 'cult classic' for some people ,a really hyped and overrated one anyway. There's absolutely no plot nor story or any kind of interesting characters (not mentioning there's no character developments or any information about their background or anything...) -what's the big hype behind this movie anyway?.... it's obviously just a bunch of stupid teenagers who wants to get sex -so each and every scene were dedicated for this purpose -like a collection of bad scenes along with terrible writing. But the worst part is the fact that it's not even funny -not even a single joke....the whole humor is just too vulgar (mainly sex jokes) and uninspired garbage without any meaning nor aim behind it -",1,2012

"I laughed more when i saw Philadelphia. When you're 6 you have poop and p*** humor, when you're a teenager you have sex and semen humor(apparently...), only if you're an oblivious, obnoxious, immature, sex crazed teenager can you find humor in a scene where a guy has ""sex"" with a pie. Even I'm 17 and cant for the life of me understand how anyone can find this movie amusing. Except teenage boys(and confused middle aged men) who likes to look at half naked teenage girls, or women in their late 20's playing teenagers.",1,2002
"That's what is looks like. Very distasteful ""comedy"". Not as funny or original as those 70's Porky's or National Lampoons movies. This represents the type of movies coming out to ""entertain"" our young adults. In other words..""sex, booze and drugs is cool"" very typical of our society.",1,1999

"This is a disgusting movie. I was horrified by it when I saw it. I was more frighten than amused by the jokes and gags. It is quite evident that this was made for the young generation as they are the only ones who find this funny. I am 18, and is both disgusted and horrified by this. If this is what will sell, I wish to have no part with both my generation and Hollywood. There is not one amusing scene in this garbage. I have a better time watching grass grow then sitting though this. At least the grass has enough decency not to be gross when growing. To sum this all up, this is modern day rubbish that attracts to the simple and closed-mined.",1,2001
"As if teens who choose abstinence don't need to be ostracized any further, there's this lovely sack of crap to alienate them even further.  I had the privilege of seeing the unrated version.  I didn't find the movie's content in and of itself offensive, it's just that it has a terrible message (""you must lose your virginity as soon as possible, even if you're a teenager"") and isn't even that funny.  Guy has violent diarrhea after so-called ""friend"" slips him some laxative.  Guy drinks beer with semen in it.  Guy prematurely ejaculates when he's about to have sex with his dream girl. People use various objects for sexual gratification.  Oh, stop, or I'll just DIE laughing!",1,2002
"Fans of this movie keep saying that people who dislike American Pie are easily offended snobs.  Trust me, sex violence and profanity are hardly offensive to me, and I've seen far more graphic film (my favorite movie is way more disgusting).  I am, however, offended by complete and unrelenting stupidity.  You can't image how glad I am that I got to see this for free. If I had payed, I would have never forgiven myself.  I didn't totally hate it, as I am a fan of Alyson Hannigan, but I would sooner swallow glass than recommend it to anyone other than despised enemies.  Oh yeah, I AM a teenager(17), and if there are humans that actually act like this, thank god I am smart enough to avoid them entirely.",1,2000
"This was the first film of its kind and has done nothing to discourage filmmakers putting random unnecessary female nudity and sexual content in so called teen 'comedy's'. The film rely's heavily on unrealistic sexual scenes and nudity. The most extreme being a female character visiting a lad from school she barely knows, being left for 2 minutes in his bedroom and returns to find that in his absence she's stripped off and started masturbating over female pornography that she found in his dresser draw. Reality check anyone? This film could have been greatly improved by removing a few ridiculous scenes so that it was male AND female friendly. Unfortunately this was made purely for testosterone fuelled teenage boys to watch (alone)in their bedrooms with a box of tissues.",1,2007
"hey guys I have an idea, let's make the worst movie ever made! cool how about we take four unsympathetic characters have them say the words ""f**k"" and ""sex"" a thousand times over and then throw in some poo poo humor to satisfy the nine-year-olds in the audience.",1,1999

She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, ""Yeah, pretty much."" Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.",6,2013
"American Pie is a fairly good movie,with good humor and a funny storyline,its a total teenage movie but its better than average ones.The story lines sort of stupid and the characters are extremely immature for there age,but thats what makes it so funny and definitely better than the sequels.",8,2012
"As I am not an American teenager myself, I failed to grasp the sense of the entire movie, I am afraid.",1,2007
"I had always heard that ""American Pie"" was so hilarious!!! Now let me say that I had heard this from a bunch of teenagers, when I was 12. They were my age. Even when I was 12 I really didn't like kids or teenagers that much because I though they were completely stupid and so foolish, actually laughing at the sex and toilet humor that they think is hilarious. This movie was full of them, and I was perplexed on how anybody could really find this cute. Personally I think it's disgusting and repulsive, not to mention embarrassing and diminishing to one's reputation. How do you think people regard me? They think I actually am that intelligent. Ew. Back to the movie. I have to say besides the jokes, the movie plot was horrible, very fragile and frail, like a building with a poorly constructed frame. It really had no purpose. They wanted to lose their virginity by prom night? Whoop-dee-doo, there is barely a teenager who doesn't. Way to be unique. The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but then again I don't really like most of the actors. I don't really like Tara Reid that much. To me she never picked character's that I actually sympathized with. What disappoints me most about this film, and many recent films, is that they seem to take teen sex, or sex outside of marriage, as some little joke, like it doesn't matter. I'm a Catholic, but this really doesn't have to do with anything about my faith. Sex is a deep expression of love and something that should not be taken lightly, especially since the only reason they want to screw you is to for their own pleasure, or their own sick goals, like in this noble movie(ew). With all the pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, sex is not as carefree (if it ever was) as it used to be, and it doesn't help when Hollywood promotes it as a selling point. Oh my goodness, grow up already!",1,2005

"Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.",10,2005

It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!",10,2002
"It's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to watch it.  ""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies.  It will blow away your senses...",10,1999
"The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high.

"In the year 1999, ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"" were undoubtedly the best films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special effects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology. The still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single shot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film is initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was happening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu Reeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate simulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's inhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison. ",10,2005

But these two movies do not enjoy the position and the popularity of this movie - The Matrix, why? Look at the box office success of the Matrix. Look at the popularity of this movie. Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb.

"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.",10,1999
"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.",10,2013
"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",10,2000
"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.",10,2001
"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",10,2000
"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender.",10,1999
"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.",9,2001
After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher's best movie even better than se7en. It's not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you'll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.,10,1999
"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.",10,2000
"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.",5,2007
"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",5,2005

"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other?  This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.",1,2000
"In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.",1,2002
"Although this film was watchable for the first hour or so, it goes very rapidly downhill for the sorry remainder of it's duration. There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while.",1,2000
"So. It flirts a bit with the ideals of anti-conformism and anti-corporate (a bit hypocritical considering a corporate made this movie, but let's pretend otherwise), and then offers as a solution a gang of people meeting up to beat up each other. Like ""to hell with this system, we'll make a super gang of fighters and take over!"". And then what? I see people rebelling but without any goal or project beside rebelling. ""We are tired of this system, we make gangs and beat up corporates!"" I won't even go into the plot flaws of the protagonist etc because that's be too easy.",1,2013
"If you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullible--even for a filmgoer.  Never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist, soulless society by none other than News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch).  These people are just toying with you--they're in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever (as is born out by the ending--the film goes...NOWHERE).  Avoid this nonsense.",1,2002
"Let me put it this way: If I ever had to list the 10 scariest things that could happen to me, I'd say in first place: living in a country where this turd is considered a masterpiece. Oh no wait, that would be second. First would be having to raise kids in such a place. And If you happen to live there I strongly advice you to get the heck out as fast as you can because that country is rotten to the core culturally, morally and spiritually, a zombie place. There's something profoundly wrong in the ""idea"" that any issue a man can have with society can be addressed by him meeting some others in his same situation and beating each other senseless. That's the dumbest idea that has ever come to any entity walking on two legs and the scariest thing is that someone had actually the resources to put this monstrosity in the form of a movie; even worse, that there may be a constituency for it out there. Fortunately, it seems that most of that crowd is concentrated in a few places which must be a relief for sensible people around the world. So just stay away from those places and everything will be fine.",1,2013
"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.",1,2000
"Now that the last episode has been shown in Australia, and having very much enjoyed the show despite seeing it out of order in several different countries, I'd like to make a few general comments. Thankfully the ABC showed series six and seven weekly in blocks of two episodes without commercials; thus the pleasure was undiluted.",9,2007
"I first caught ""The West Wing"" for two reasons: 1) our school was AGAIN on strike and 2) I had a crush on Annabeth Gish from ""The X-Files"", and I'd heard she was going to be in the Season 5 premiere. I watched a few eps on Bravo to get a little background so I wouldn't come in completely cold (my very first ep was ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"", which is still in my top ten). It took me awhile to get used to Aaron Sorkin's writing style, but by this point, it's my absolute favorite show.",10,2004
"I just started watching this show 5 days ago. My family received the first 3 seasons on DVD and I put it in and started watching. I'm on the 14th episode of the third season now, and having sat here for 36+ hours watching, I must say this show is intelligent, witty, funny, reasonable, has wonderful acting and actors, writing, and is a great look into the White House and the government of this country.",10,2005
"Most of the time, Hollywood depicts American politicians, and the President in particular, as either buffoons or unlikely action heroes. Exhibits A, B and C: Independence Day, Air Force One and Deep Impact. Thank God, then, for television, which finally enabled people to see these powerful men in a more realistic light. Real-time thriller 24, to name one show, painted a compelling, if somewhat dark portrait of US politics, and the interesting but short-lived Commander in Chief went as far as imagining what would happen if a woman became President of the United States. Neither series, however, comes close to the genius of The West Wing, which dealt with domestic and foreign problems with more precision than most news shows. Most importantly, though, it achieved the impossible: it made politics fun to watch.",10,2008

Allow me to gush. ,10,2002
"As many, many other reviewers have said (and others have agreed with) this is as good as TV gets ... period. I don't think there is a better show ever to tell the truth and perhaps that's because Aaron Sorkin's newest show only has one season under its belt so far. Perhaps after seven years it will top even this monumental achievement in television but it has quite a challenge ahead of it.",10,2013
"That's right, people like this would never be put in the White House. The West Wing is an idealistic presidency where a group of people come together under the Barlett administration to, like, better the world they live in. Imagine that. The show deftly avoids being sappy or sentimental. These people know that it isn't all sunshine and roses, that they will have to fight every day and lose a lot of the time. All through this is the kind of quick witted verbal assaults that people wish they were capable of, highlighted by several different relationships. The cute and playful Allison Janney and Timothy Busfield, the excitable Bradley Whitford and the more restrained John Spencer, and the abrasive, but frequently right, Richard Schiff. The entire cast is phenomenal. At the head is Martin Sheen who plays a tough president who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, but, more often than not, will use his well rounded speech skills to great effect.",10,2007
"I have nothing but praise for the West Wing. As a self-confide politics nut this programme easily appealed to me. It had a fantastic cast, including Martin Sheen who is one of my favourite actors, and the production values could easily match most movies being made. Programmes like the West Wing are a sign American Television can challenge modern cinema.",10,2008
"I never watched this show in its first run. That is an honest disclosure. My review, based on watching it on Netflix without commercials and in serial succession, will probably reflect a different experience from the weekly viewers'. Fair is fair.",5,2015
"Just because a show smothers the audience with layers of 'technical' dialogue doesn't mean it is particularly 'worthwhile'; it's only a form of 'shock tactics' where the political vernacular script-writing zooms over and past the viewer's heads as they sit there in dumb silence, the gullible ones thinking, ""Gosh, this show is soooo good!"".",3,2015
"""The West Wing"" seems to be a ""soap opera"" that gives the questionable impression that all these very smart (at least in their own minds) people run around playing this game of politics by shooting questions at each other all day long. Unfortunately, it now seems better than a lot of other stuff on TV, however that is not a good thing.",3,2008
"A high watermark of American serial TV drama. The West Wing's considerable success can be put down to many factors. Prima inter pares of them is the idea: to play out political drama in soap-style relationships, with the formality and high integrity of one illuminating and affecting the informality and willfulness of the other and vice versa. On paper the conceit looks straightforward enough. Yet to engagingly balance the melodrama of relationships and the processes of government takes constant vigilance and invention.",9,2006
"I can understand that viewers would enjoy a well written, entertaining show. It's usually a bit suspenseful. A great cast. But what's galling is the preoccupation with abject jingoist sentiments and imperialist revisionist history in nearly every other scene. But then, that's also completely predictable for U.S. television, I suppose. ",2,2017
The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.,10,2006
"What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? ""The Sopranos"" has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, it's a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.",10,2006
THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007),10,2008
"The Sopranos is a terrific show.  It may be violent, racist, sexist, and bad to the bone, it is also funny, melodramatic and cool.  The characters are very well done and the acting is some of the best I've seen in years.  It is also pretty keen for creator David Chase to pick Northern New Jersey as the set piece for his opus of crime life.  I have liked this show alot since it aired on HBO in January of last year and I will keep on watching it because of the intrigue and drama.",10,2000
"To the people complaining about the finale, seriously? You're going to give a show that you supposedly loved 1 star just because you didn't like the last 4 minutes? God forbid a show actually make you use your brain to get answer instead of spoon-feeding it to everyone. Please do yourself a favor and google ""sopranos ending explained"" and read the first article, it's long but you'll appreciate the show much more. Showing Tony actually getting whacked would have been tasteless, boring, and wouldn't have left us with anything to talk about. If you really pay attention and look at the fine details everything is there. Plus we had already seen Tony get shot on several occasions, and the fact that people spent 6 seasons cheering the guy on and then want to see the series end with him bleeding out on the table in front of his whole family. Some things are better left to the imagination, and when you put all the pieces together it's really pretty amazing what David Chase pulled off.",10,2012
"The Sopranos must be the most overrated television show in history. I have never before witnessed a movie or show with so many undeveloped and unfinished story lines. Under developed characters and acting thats is B movie level. Stevie Van Zant!, give me a break.",1,2006
"As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view. If you've never watched this show, you're in for an extended treat. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of the life he has been born to and, quite frankly, would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given a chance for a way out, finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you didn't, trust me you've never seen a TV show end like this.",10,2010
"When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves.",10,2007
"I just finished the show yesterday, and couldn't wait to do so. While I am late to the game viewing it by years, I seriously cant understand the high ratings and hype this show gets. ",5,2016
"David Chase's ""The Sopranos"" is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory. Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion, it's devoid of a soul. As anyone reading likely knows already, James Gandolfini *IS* Tony Soprano, a big, fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife, and two bratty, sh*t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America (that's New Jersey, by the way). Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of ""Saturday Night Live"" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates. It's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me (and apparently only me). Allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something American TV hardly allows. But Chase - and his entourage of money-gorged, Emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of (even obviously fictionalized) organized crime (a la ""The Godfather""). Instead, Chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should I say month after month. Or is it year after year? It seems like the show's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse). Much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to ""network"" structure, with plot lines that go nowhere, and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin. But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure, why does it always feel like I'm watching a soap-opera? Tired mob clichés, bored housewives, self-serving, irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere. More than ever, I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p*ssed at this show. It's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book (Danté's ""Inferno"" springs to mind).",1,2005
"Where do I begin? I would be forced to nominate ""The Sopranos"" as the worst television show of all-time, the worst THING of all-time. It is pretentious, derivative schlock masquerading- and passing- as high art.",1,2009
The entire series had some very bad flaws and had poor writing off and on. I am not on the Soprano bandwagon. There were so many side stories which were just a complete waste of time. The longer the series went on the worse it got.,6,2013
"Wow. I LOVED the whole series, and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly. Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5, while remaining better than anything else on television. But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons. ",10,2007
"This series was not what I expected. At first I liked the series very much since James Gandolfini is excellent for his role. He brings forward a character that has his doubts and inner conflicts, but at time can be a really scary mobster.",4,2015
"I started watching The Sopranos in June 2013 and it took me around 2 months to finish, and I know I could have watched it a lot quicker than that if possible.",10,2013
